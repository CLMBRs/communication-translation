Belmont Estate is on the market for $63 million and boasts roughly 22,000 square feet of luxurious finishes and elaborate architecture on 1.28 acres. Listed on Thursday, the home is being sold by high-end real estate firm Sotheby’s International Realty Canada.
“Within the city we’ve had homes that have sold for $56 million, $33 million, $31 million but this will be the record of the offering price,” listing agent Christa Frosch of Sotheby’s tells BuzzBuzzNews.
The three-storey home has five bedrooms, twelve bathrooms and an elevator in the west wing. Built to entertain, two main gallery halls can seat up to 100 guests. The Italian-inspired kitchen includes a fireplace and walls and ceilings throughout the home feature murals and artwork. Lavish amenities include an indoor pool and sauna, a six-car garage and a private entrance in-law’s suite.
Surrounding the property is a Versailles-inspired garden with a variety of trees, plants and an orchard. In the spring, over 12,000 flowers bloom in the tiered, three-level garden.
According to Frosch, the listing has received global attention and, despite being on the market for only 24 hours, buyers are already showing interest.
“We just went to the market yesterday, it’s private through Sotheby’s and we’ve already started to get calls,” says Frosch.

Stay well hydrated—that means you should include about 48- 64 ounces of liquid (non-calorie) each day. You will be drinking small amounts (“sips”) every hour through the day since you will not be able to drink a large amount all at once.
On Day Four after your surgery, begin adding liquid protein during this Phase (20 to 30 grams per day). That means you should buy a protein powder suggested by your dietitian, doctor or nurse. We recommend:
Unjury (20grams of whey protein isolate per packet) once a day (available at our office or www.UNJURY.com or 800-517-5111
Watch for signs of dehydration!
Review protein sources: meats, chicken, turkey, eggs, cheese, low fat milk, yogurt, tofu, soy beans, other legumes (beans)
You may use baby food without added sugar or starch such as baby food chicken, no blends such as chicken and rice.
You can eat fruits without sugar or syrup.
You may use a blender or food processor to keep foods soft.
Introduce new foods slowly and one at a time.
For extra protein add powdered milk (1/4 c) to your 1 cup of skim milk (this give about 18 grams of protein)
Taking vitamins will become a daily part of your life after gastric bypass surgery. We recommend:
Calcium Citrate, 1500 mg in 3 divided doses with Vitamin D 3 (2000 IU per day)
Continue to eat a high protein food at each meal such as lean meat or chicken
(50 grams of protein for women/ 60 grams for men), lean ground turkey is good choice for this phase
Use skim milk as a protein source (2 cups per day)
Get your lab work at 3 months, 6 months 1 year and yearly after surgery
See your surgeon for regular check-ups and lab work
Call or e-mail the nurse or dietitian if you have questions 412-741-8862
Hi, I'm Rudy. It will be ten years on June 21, 2014 I started on a remarkable journey; I had gastric bypass surgery.
Five months before that day, I was at my primary care physician's and he asked me if I ever thought of having bypass surgery. I never gave it a thought. I was on three blood pressure medications, cholesterol medicine, and 100 units of insulin every day. I had trouble breathing, just walking up a slight grade I had to use an inhaler.
Surgery went well. Recovery didn't take long and I was eating real food. I've been around 180 lbs. for 10 years now. I went from a 44 inch waist to a 34 inch waist. I feel strong and I have a lot more energy.
I don't use an inhaler anymore. I'm off all my blood pressure medications, cholesterol medicine and I went from 100 units of insulin down to 20 units of insulin a day.
At my heaviest, I weighed 283 lbs. and I have managed to keep 100 lbs. off for 10 years.
One thing I've learned is that I can leave food on my plate when I'm full.

Travelling alone can be a daunting prospect, not least to attend a wedding alone. The original plan had been to go with another neighbour, but she slipped a disc in her back and was unable to fly. Having fully absorbed the message from our esteemed Minister for Disabled People that everywhere is now fully accessible and disabled people don't need any extra money to pay for that perfect access I wasn't put off by such trivial concerns and on thursday I went to Ireland to see my lovely neighbour marry in her home town of Swinford.
Despite Maria's assurances of perfect access it seemed to take me much more time to arrange my travel and be more expensive than for the other guests. Travel Insurance cost double the standard amount, then there was arranging support at each airport before I went, which could only be confirmed on a 10p a minute phone line. The Bride had booked a hotel with access for the reception, in which I had to stay because whilst all the cheaper accomodation 'just over the road' was within comfortable drunken stumbling distance it certainly wasn't within any kind of deathwalking distance.
My neighbour had booked an accessible mini bus to take us from the airport to hotel which we eventually managed to find after a somewhat disturbing Mrs Robinson moment. There was a very attractive young man who looked in his early 20's on the flight who was also going to the wedding, who helped with my bag. I began to think it might be great fun until he told me had never flown alone before and his mum hadn't given him any money for the mini bus at which point I felt like a paedophile!
The mini bus journey was similar to the flight...with the added smell of old diesel for ambience. We all sat, in somewhat shell shocked silence, fighting the urge to vomit. Eventually we got to the hotel in Westport and then it got really tricky. But, I was in Ireland...so I offered up my prayers to Maria. I knew she'd fix it.
I'm really glad I got to see the bride and groom on their big day, but I can't help feeling that Maria really let me down. I had such faith in her, she tells us all often enough that everything's great and well...it kind of wasn't great. More a bit crap really. So next time I think I can travel alone, without any support I'll have to remember Maria and her magical misleading missives.
*Apologies to the people of Kerry who I'm sure are all very nice
If its any consolation, the Irish have Kerry-men as the but of all their jokes, with good reason.
Excellent post Kaliya, very well written. Sorry things didn't go better for you, not that it's not expected to anyway. This needs to be read by all in government, not that it would make any difference though. Loved your come back to Mr. offensive, don't know that I would have been so polite; TV and billboards need to run a campaign on educating people to the different disabilities and especially invisible disabilities, so sad that in this day and age there is so much ignorance around.
Thanks for posting this. I forget how sheltered I am by having a hubby in tow - or, no, what actually happens is that I conveniently blank out how hideous things were whenever he couldn't be there.
For our wedding we tried relatively hard to ensure accessibleness for our wheelchair using guest, although being in a listed building meant he couldn't get upstairs for the marriage ceremony. We visited the accommodation (100 yards away on the flat from the reception venue), measured it, photographed it, judged it according to the very useful criteria you have posted. But he declined to come, because he'd had such a horrendous time visiting other 'accessible' venues and finding out they weren't really.
He just couldn't risk the health consequences of turning up to find things weren't actually as he needed them. This is why it's such a tragedy that accessibility isn't thought through from the perspective of what people really need.
YOu look so beautiful (Then again you would look beautiful in sack cloth lol)
I rarely go out now - since i had my sticked kicked out from under me and the time they refused to sit down in a closed cafe in the local mall, since then my life has got smaller and smaller.
So life is very small. Friends are nowhere to be found and I wonder what I did to get this.
But - I am still alive at the moment so that is a plus, I love my family, and I live vicariously through others who blog LOLOL
I love you taking us with you on your adventures thorugh the accessible world of the UK...
Hope you are OK and have got over the stress of your trip now <3
Ah, now I understand the 'Ireland didn't go well' comment in your email earlier! Poor you, that wasn't much fun at all. I expect you were relieved to be home and on 'terra firma'!!
No extra costs for access? Asking for a disabled access hack if I want to take my chair (Quickie Ti - weighs little, I can just pick it up and put it in, no need for time-consuming ramps), to the pub here in Wirral jacks up the normal fair by about £1.50.
Not so, though, if I don't have my chair. Clearly discriminatory.
You should do a Rough Guide version of international travel!
The rude drunk - a classic example. I too admire your dignity in the face of adversity.
Katie price has tweeted for models all shapes or sizes! are you going to give it a go for all young disabled people as you certainly do sparkle. Just a thought?
Think she is becoming aware of all drawbacks as parents and herself are having to set up schmo as Harvey's is closing and they want the pupils to stay together cos of friendships and routine, as we all know how especially this is important.
Dear me, what an ordeal; you looked great though!
I miss the holidays, but I've accepted it now. I can't risk the knock on effect of months of even worse health than usual.
You were very brave to do what you did!
If you ever want to prove him wrong,I'm right here Bendy,at the back of this very long queue :D

He attracts all these girls who are over obsessed with him, HE IS JUST A 16 YEAR OLD BOY, he is human and no different to us boys. So why are girls obsessed with him!
Im a 15 year old boy, he also annoys me due to the fact that his boxers are always showing, do you know this originated from PRISON, guys used to pull there trousers too under their butt to show that they are free and wanting anul s*x
I'm g*y and have awesome gaydar. Kids a little q***r. As for him dating a girl...It's called playing straight. Did it for 5 years myself. It's the easiest game to play. Either way. Listen to real music that talks about real issues, not petty adolesent emotions. Dare to think think for yourself rather than eat the force fed s**t that everyone likes. I hope some of you are smarter than you appear to be..
people have there facts all wrong,his a boy not a girl,he never used those things which change your voice he just got better at it,he's nice,kind,sweet,awsome,cool,a great singer and caring,and that he is american and canadian,haven't you watched tv that you can be a person of two countries
-In all of his music videos, he portays himself at American. The American flag, the American dream, etc. I find it insulting he seems to want to hide his nationalistic pride for his home country (and mine), Canada.
-He flaunts all of his more famous associates and uses them as credibility.
-He pretends to be an activist for g*y rights, when he hides his own bisexuality from the press. (He is in fact bisexual. Ask anyone who knew him from before he became famous.)
-He uses voice enhancers (aka autotuners) for recordings and concerts. He is not as good a singer as many believe him to be (if you don't believe this, compare his early youtube uploads to his current songs)
2. he cant control that, so its pretty low.
and yeah im a boy,and no, im not g*y, im a nice guy. i dont love his songs or anything , but he's not that bad tbh.
he's an insult to real music. autotune does not mean you can sing well.
I don't think he's g*y I just don't like him:
-He is 16... how does he even know what love is all about or have the life experience to back it up?
Also... just cause guys call him g*y in no way means that they are jealous of Justin Bieber, we just don't see what the big deal with him is... also all the Justine Bieber fans who were upset about Arcade Fire getting best album at the Grammy's instead of Justin Bieber needs to calm. If you haven't heard Arcade Fire's album and you don't know it... then don't complain that J.B. should have won.... We've heard his stuff and don't like it... might as well widen your musical boundaries a little, eh? (I'm from Michigan, not Canada)
Anyway that's my reasoning... agree with me or not, that's just how I feel.
1) he HAS hit puberty. listen to his recent songs
4) he got a haircut and he looks soo much better
Back to the subject. he has completed more things already than most people do in their life time! And its just the beginning
And by the way EVERY sing guy in this world thinks about girls and wants girls. Hes just like every other guy.
I'm a girl but I don't like him that much.
1. He hasn't got puberty and he's 16.
2. If he still hasn't got it, he acts like he's 20 and sings about girls which is annoying and weird for his age type.
3. He has only girl fans OBVIOUSLY. Only 1 or 2 boys around the world or even none like him. He is unpopular and people are his fans cause they way he looks. DUMB.
5. He doesn't have a sponser. He should be by disney or something.
The reasons could be as many as you can just think about because when you are drawing others fan's towards you then must definitely the competitive environment will be alarmingly high and same goes here with Justin Drew Bieber.
2 you hear him every freaking day on a commercial he reminds me of a girl singer or alvin and the chipmunks
3 i dont really hate g**s but can you compare the way they talk act and what they sound like and they share many similarities?
4why do you even like him? he doesnt look hot. he thinks he can rap with people who can. i respect real rappers. if i were him i would be imbarrassed to try to be a rapper even though im not that good at rapping.
i think i have made my point i dont hate him,its just i think he is making so many wrong choices leading him in random success
People are annoying. Don't listen to them. Guys do it cause their just JEALOUS of him and his sexiness, hotness, and his hair. They just call him that because of those things. THEY MAKE ME MADDDDD!
4 reasons why people hate justin bieber.
He has the voice of a chipmunk.
we are not JEALOUS because he has no talent so wat is there to be jealous of??
that is why i hate justin bieber.
h**l if I know if he is g*y or not, just a little bit odd. Mostly I just hate his music, a bunch of sing-about-love stuff again. I get enough of that from way to many places. But I, in general, hate alot of what play on a couple radio stations around me, so its not really targeted right at beiber.
His music is symbolic of the complete commercialization of modern pop music.
It's music made simply for a quick profit.
If you like it you've never listened to real music made for the purpose of sounding good.
Why dont you just become a walking billboard for pepsi and get it over with?
g*y is used as a derrogatory term which is not the same as homosexual.
i dont think he is g*y i just dont like the fact he didnt have to work to become famous.
Boys think Justin is g*y because they are attracted to him. Girls like Bieber because he appears to be gentle and delicate in handling women. All of you haters die with agonizing pain of jealousy, none of you can do any harm to how females think of him. Learn to respect people and mean it from the heart, you might also get someone to like you.
ACTUALLY!! he admitted himself he was g*y, umm no hes not smart, he ran into a glass door, hmm lets see what else, umm he started his own nail polish brand which comes out in a couple weeks, i think that pretty much says it all right their!!
Lets start with..He has no talent and his voice can pass for a girl..Which I guess is fine considering girls dig Jonas Brother, Zac Effron, etc. Have fun with that. Stop defending someone who's a 1-year sensation and get a life
Justin serenaded wonderful or better than a great I like popular songs, particularly as it is talented. all those who hate Justin are g**s because they feel jealous of him because he is handsome at the same time a rising singer and a small age. I myself appreciate the wonderful artist with this beautiful and talented .
I think all guys hate him because guys have completely different taste in music and his voice is like girl but he is a little boy growing now, when he is 18/20 years old, his voice grow up a regular guy but the secret I love you and his music
some guys might be jealous because all the pre-teen girls want him, but guess what? THEY CAN'T HAVE HIM. in 2 years nobody will care, his songs are f*****g repetitive. have you listened to baby? 80% of the song is just him saying "baby" and he sounds like a chick and acts like a "gangsta" i'm not jealous its just getting old. all you hear about is Justin Bieber and how he's so awesome and he hasn't done anything for society. when we could focus on other important"er" s**t.

A thread to brag about your current piercings, Tattoos and how/if they contribute to sex or make you feel sexy. Also a place to inform people of the crazy things one can do they're bodies :)
Hopefully other people have something to brag about too, Thanks
You can find a thread on piercings here - http://www.lovehoney.co.uk/community/forums/sex-tips-and-talk/9771-piercings/page-27/
It's helpful to have a search above to see if any threads like this have been posted before, just so we don't end up with multiple threads of the same topic. Hope it helps :) x
I also have a tattoo on my lower back that looks like a cross and my current oh likes to use it as a target practice!
Just to show we are all different, don't like any of the above a woman's body is A beautiful enough thing to not need anything to enhance it.
Just my opinion, it's your body to do with as you wish.
Weird thing is that I'm pretty scared of needles.
I've had the PA for over a decade now so my wife and I don't really notice it that much any more, I still like having it though and like the way or looks. I've had up to an 8mm thick ring in it but have come back down to 5mm which I prefer.
It's more an adrenaline thing for me, rather than enhancing it.. Kinda get a kick outta it.. ;)
Would love some tatts, but too much of a wimp to get them! 😥
Only my ear was pierced, but has pretty much sealed now after I fell out of love with it.
I have always wanted to get my nipples pierced but I have no money to do it for the moment. Also I am afraid I couldn't let them heal correctly as my man would probably want to play with them straight away!
I have no tattoos and I have a few piercings.
I love mine and I feel so much better when I am wearing them. I would like a tattoo but I want to wait for something I know I will love.
I had one of those once, but the ex just thought it felt strange so I got rid lol. To be fair it was pretty bulky whilst I was wearing it too...I'm sure women would get more of a kick out of them though!
I have 2 tattoos, self designed :) And I have my nose and ears pierced. None of them really contribute to sex, but one of my tattoos has my boyfriend's initials in ogham writing and is below my hipbone (normally under my knickers unless I wear something really flimsy) which he thinks is sexy :)
Would love to get my tongue done (bf is up for that!) but worried about it affecting my teeth.
I love getting piercings, and I'm pretty fond of them once they're in and healed, but...
Healing them is the worst for me. I tend to yank them out sitting still (I have NO idea how I pulled a nose screw out on thin air), never mind in sexy time.... I've had to retire three partially healed helixes in the past two years because of this, and haven't bothered to get any more as such.
I have both nostrils done, and my septum. Depending on what course I end up on next month, I'm thinking of my forward helix again.
We're not so rough and over the top these days, so they miiiiight survive ._.

In 1971, we believed in a dream. We believed there must be a better way. When you dream a little, common people, working together, can do uncommon things.
Quad is the embodiment of one man's dream to find a better way.
With a $35,000 second mortgage on his home and capital raised from a handful of people who believed in him – and 11 co-founders who made a courageous leap of faith – Harry launched Quad/Graphics on July 13, 1971.
We haven’t been given more opportunities; we’ve just made more of the opportunities presented to us.
A can-do attitude leads to rapid-fire growth
Those first years were lean and print contracts were few. But with perseverance and what we like to call a can-do attitude — a characteristic that continues to distinguish us from other printers — the fledgling company hung on. We slowly gained business, primarily when no other printer would take the work.
The turning point came in 1977, when we started printing work for Newsweek. The popular national publication was sold on our groundbreaking ideas and entrepreneurial spirit, but above all, they trusted in us. Newsweek put us on the map as a high-quality, innovative print services provider.
Rapid-fire expansion continued across the country, matched with investments in the industry’s most advanced equipment and technology.
Along the way, we also founded the industry’s first and only dedicated research and development subsidiary, set up a network of imaging sites and photography studios, created innovative solutions for our clients (including mailing and distribution breakthroughs like the industry’s first and largest co-mailing technology), picked up awards for printer of the year, best place to work and environmental stewardship, and established a global presence through international partnerships in Latin America, India and Europe.
All of us who come after Harry must take what he created and push it forward, push it beyond, what he ever hoped it could be.
A new generation of visionary leadership
When we unexpectedly lost Harry in July 2002, many thought the company would collapse without his leadership. He was, after all, an industry icon. But we persevered – and prospered.
As we continue to transform our company and our industry, we are at the ready. Quad powered. Quad Proud.
With a broader global footprint and wider range of capabilities, we could now reach more clients with more solutions.
Prudent acquisitions such as these support our ongoing strategy to transform both our company and the industry – all while adding value for our clients, shareholders and employees. Acquisitions are made with an eye to advancing technologies, capabilities and efficiencies that help our clients drive top-line revenue and minimize overall costs.
As a result of the game-changing Worldcolor acquisition, Quad became a publicly traded company on the New York Stock Exchange on July 6, 2010. The steady hand of the Quadracci family retains voting control, and continues to provide consistency in ownership, leadership and strategy.
We are proud printers, innovating all aspects of our company and our industry.
Today, Quad is a leading global provider of print and media solutions. Our remarkable growth is powerful testament to our inimitable culture, visionary leadership team and employees worldwide who take pride in their work and are wholly invested in the success of our clients – and our company.
Working together, we are driven to find a better way – and to deliver on our promise of Performance through Innovation.
As a company, we adapt to change – in fact, more often than not, we are the change. Where others see challenges, we see opportunities. We’re a high-tech company, but we succeed the old-fashioned way: through honesty, integrity, hard work, doing the right thing and always putting our clients first.

The 2016 Pulitzer Prizes will be announced April 18 at 3pm ET. Because the names of the finalists are not released ahead of time, the winner is a surprise every year. But for nine years we have been posting a prediction list prepared by a fellow Pulitzer collector and research scientist. The list is the product of a regression analysis that weighs a given book's performance in other book awards, as well as the author's past award and nomination history.
Comment on our lists, or offer your own opinion about who you think will win the 2016 Pulitzer Prize for Fiction:
I'm basing this on a list on Goodreads.com. I've not been successful at finding a list of selections on the Powell's website itself.
Humility and grace are becoming dinosaurs. Can't wait to read the book now simply based upon the merit of the author's character.
No but it's listed on the pulitzer website (when they announce the winners).
did anyone post who was on the jury?
@zacharybloomzooey @ey814 I don't operate the PPrize site, but although I don't think there is general opposition to that, I know the site moderator has his hands full keeping up with the tasks around the fiction awards... but, I'll let him respond if that's a possibility.
Tom, you are a saint. I can confirm they do ship, very friendly and helpful. And I now have a first printing on its way! Thank you!
@ejcrowe42 Not sure about Greenlight, but it was a Book Passage First Edition Club selection, which is how I got my copy. Which compels me to point out that the Pulitzer winner for each of the past four years has been a selection by at least one of the three FECs I subscribe to (Odyssey, Book Passage, Powell's). Not to mention this year's National Book Award winner (Odyssey).
I wanted to share an idea. Could we make a second thread about the Pulitzer Prizes in the other arts categories (general non-fiction, drama, and biography, history)?
If anyone is still looking for a first printing, Diane's Books in Greenwich CT had a pile of five first printings when I checked today at 12:45 ET. They sell them for regular price, and probably will ship.
@JpCambert @AlexKerner It was a finalist in general non-fiction! So that's cool!
@ey814 @ejcrowe42 @mrbenchly Haven't read it yet. It was on my radar last year, and we tried to get an event with the author, but Grove couldn't work it out, and then when Viet was back in the states in the fall, there were no more first printings and we didn't pursue it any further.
That may explain why there are pre-pub-dated copies floating around. Grove doesn't usually hold with strict on sale dates, and we were told that the author wasn't really going to be stateside after the publication date, so Viet signed books as available in certain bookstores.
Thanks to everyone who runs this site! It's always a pleasure! Two debuts in the running this year and some surprises! Always exciting!
Congratulations to Viet Thanh Nguyen and all of the other 2016 Pulitzer Prize winners. And to all of you who post frequently on this site, keep up the good work.
Congrats to The Sympathizer! Deft, well written, tight plot and intriguing narrator. I'm not surprised that it was recognized, however, on a personal note I was rooting for Tsar.
Emily - thanks for your comments and keep up the great work at Odyssey. Although I am not a member of your firsts club, I do frequent your website to see what your store as picked, given its excellent track record. I believe I ordered Marra's Constellation and Meyer's The Son in the same shipment a couple of summers ago :) This summer sounds like a blockbuster for you guys; I should go ahead and call in an order!
@BRAKiasaurus @AlexKerner @ey814 I actually have the Kelly Link book in paperback, and would never have dreamed it would be a contender, let alone finalist.
@AndrewBoston Looking forward to reading The Sympathizer, and thanks for being part of the PPrize community!
@Guardiands Yes, copies will begin to appear online (ebay or through abebooks.com or similar online dealers). Initially, they'll be priced really high and will sell, but eventually the price will settle. I think with 50,000 of them out there, still a good chance to get one without paying way too much. The first print run of ALL THE LIGHT WE CANNOT SEE was 62,500, and there are copies to be had at $50 still.
@kas1985 With 50,000 out there, one will surface, probably without having to pay a premium, though it will demand more now than it did five hours ago :-)
The accuracy of this list is almost as amazing as the enjoyment in discussing it. Thank you very much for all you do.
I would like to know this as well. I had been looking for a first printing of "The Sympathizer " for several months leading up to the announcement, without success. In fact, it is one of only two from the top 15 list here that I did not own first printings of at the time of the announcement.
Do you happen to know its initial print run?
Secondly, thank you to everyone that makes this site possible, I am not a collector, but the recommendations have led me to some of the best books I read this past year.
One last thing; the model is kind of amazing bc once again the winner was in the top 10. It's all about the science behind the art.
I love a good war novel so I'm excited to give this one my all.
Unexpected for sure. I checked it out from the library/started it, but had to return before I finished. The last evacuation happened in April so kind of fitting. PBS did an excellent documentary marking that anniversary last year. 'Matterhorn' was also phenomenal. I tried to read 'Get in Trouble' but it was too out there for me. Haven't even heard of Maud's Line' but will look into that one. Thanks again for an awesome year everyone!!
I read about half of the Kelly Link book. While I'm happy for her ( she lives in my area and I know her a little), it never would have been on my radar for this award. And MAUD'S LINE? I've never heard of.
Happy for SYMPATHIZER. Guess this means I have to read it now. :-)
And one more year the winner was one of the books on the list.
I want to read the Sellout and Delicious foods and i don't know if they will be published here (The Sellout won the NBCC which should be enough to be published, but Billy Lynn's long half time walk is still unpublished here, of course it happens the same with The good lord bird and the NBA winners usually get published).
I suppose A little life will be published anyway, and given Bill Clegg's connections Did you ever have a family will be published for sure.
I suppose The Sympathizer won't be published as fast as The Goldfinch or All the light we can not see, and i will have to wait, it happened the same with The orphan master's son
@OneMoreBook Agree--I love a surprise!
@AlexKerner Huh? Never heard of either... did anyone talk about these?
The Sympathizer is the author's first novel, if I'm not mistaken.
@ey814 Wow! I have a first edition at home, but I haven't read it yet...I wanna know the finalists too!
@JohnZ Best book I've read all year--and I've read most of the big names, I think.
@JpCambert @AlexKerner It is non-fiction, but you are correct: it deserves a pulitzer prize
@AlexKerner @JpCambert I stand corrected. I was under the impression it was a fictionalized memoir from father to son while reading it.
@JpCambert Between the World and Me wouldn't be in the fiction category
My predictions (talk about last minute) are as follows:
I would like to thank everyone for another awesome year!!! It has been a year for books. Thanks for making and maintaining the lists. I think I'm going to have to go with 'A Little LIfe,' 'Eileen' and 'Fortune Smiles' as being somewhere in there. I wouldn't mind seeing Marra's book walk away with it either. I cannot commit this year at all.
@Guardiands Did You Ever Have a Family was one of my favorite novels published last year. It would be wonderful to see it recognized.
I don't comment on here except usually at this late stage of the game. I love doing my final predictions.
The last couple of years I've done pretty terribly. I haven't correctly predicted a winner since Jennifer Egan's (I hadn't read The Orphan Master's Son when it won, but it has since become one of my favorite books, period). I was proud to correctly predict Bob Shacochis's nomination for The Woman Who Lost Her Soul, Nathan Englander's What We Talk About When We Talk About Anne Frank and Chang-Rae Lee's The Surrendered in recent years.
Because of my passion for two of these works I'm slightly afraid to predict them, but here goes:
@JohnZ I didn't mention Welcome to Braggsville. I've been reading it lately, and I think it too stands a chance of being noticed.
Very insightful post, that was a pleasure to read. i felt the same as you about Fortune Smiles, and agree with your critique of A little Life. I know Did you ever have Family has gotten mixed reviews on here, but I wouldn't mind seeing that win.
About a day and a half to go before the 2016 Pulitzer winners are announced. There seems to be nothing that is a solid lock. I haven't read all of the books purportedly in the running, but there are a few which I think may receive some consideration.
The Sellout is a sharp and biting satire in which Mr. Beatty walks a tightrope between outrageous hilarity and profound contemplation on themes that run the gamut. It wouldn't be the first comic novel to win the Pulitzer, but I wonder if the jury and board will go for it. Who knows? It might well win the prize.
The Tsar of Love and Techno shows that A Constellation of Vital Phenomena was no fluke. Mr. Marra's voice is level and distinct, and in the seeming simplicity of its prose lies much complexity. I wouldn't be surprised to see it named as a winner or a finalist.
Fates and Furies has some lovely prose, but as others have observed, the story itself is a bit insular. It does have those moments in which details are presented in a striking manner, which is something it has in common with a number of Pulitzer winners. Ms. Groff is a very good writer, and though she's been nominated elsewhere for this novel, she has yet to win a prize or award. So it might well be another finalist or winner.
And what of The Sympathizer? Viet Thanh Nguyen writes with a sharp eye and ear for human beings caught in extraordinary circumstances. He has been compared to Graham Greene, George Orwell, and Denis Johnson -- and those three aren't too shabby (ha ha). It wouldn't surprise me if this novel was a finalist, maybe even a winner.
And then, as sometimes happens, we might get thrown a curveball by the Pulitzer board and jury. They've done it before. Who's to say it won't happen again?
Really, I have no set idea on what will win come Monday. As always, I'm interested to find out.
I'd be very interested in your sci-fi recommendations!
@Mstexexec I'll see if I can get a copy from the library! :) I have a few other books queued up to read, but I'll give it a shot!
Thank you for the response. I would love to have reactions to this book from other on this site to see how my opinions fit with more expert opinions. BRAK I intend to check out many of the books you listed as well.
@Mstexexec I haven't read this book, but the cover looks familiar.
@jfieds2 I agree with so much of what you described. I am still pulling for A Little Life but I am half way through Tsar and if it wins, I will be just as happy. Personally I have no idea how Delicious Foods made the list. And I'm still wondering why there is never any mention of A Reunion of Ghosts. Has anyone read this book? Thoughts?
I "enjoyed" A LITTLE LIFE, and I think it's themes are vitally important, but in the end I felt it was incredibly flawed. I felt somewhat similarly about THE TURNER HOUSE -- a very good and "important" story, but with some elements that just didn't work for me.
Among other contenders, I think I enjoyed FATES AND FURIES more than ALL, but in my opinion, it is also probably more flawed. Further, it did not deal with the same kind of culturally/socially "important" (I am using a broad brush here, forgive me) themes that I would love a Pulitzer winner to confront, especially when there are options that do to choose from. FORTUNE SMILES was a "good" (but only good) collection, but won't win Johnson his second Pulitzer. I did not read DELICIOUS FOODS.
Bonus Pick: THE SYMPATHIZER - I don't think many people are talking about this one. It doesn't exactly have American themes, as it is narrated by a Vietnamese spy, but he is living in the US for a large chunk of the book. Moreover, it is a book that brilliantly crosses genres.
The Pulitzer Prize has been extremely populist in the last few years, so I just feel A Little Life will take it in the end with A Manual for Cleaning Women and Eileen as finalists. Maybe even there could be a third finalist and A Little Life takes it as the vote of the committee, not the jury.
Black River (This was a favorite of mine for most of 2015 but it didn't seem to get that much recognition, great book though)
I know The Sellout is the leading contender, but I have not read it yet as I mostly just buy first printings and this is proving hard to get, however I have read Tuff by Beatty, and that was not for me.
Before I go I would like to thank all of you for another great year of Pulitzer discussions, it''s a pleasure to share your advice an expertise, thank you.
Anything else that seemed a big deal when it came out but which has since been overlooked or faded?
(I ask, because there is part of me that feels you could see an unexpected, but deserving, lineup this year. For example, I could see "The Mare", "A Hand Reached Down to Guide Me", and "A Manual for Cleaning Women" being the finalists. Thoughts?)
A Little LIfe is the best book that I read that pubbed in 2015, but I think its extreme dark subject matter will count against it. If it happened for this book, though, I would be thrilled.
I also thought that Black River was very impressive and tightly written, so that's my dark horse candidate for this year's prize.
The second one will be a short stories collection, probably one that flies under the radar right now (there's always some surprised in the Pulitzer finalists).
Having read none of the books on this list (or anything published in 2015 that would be eligible for the prize, for that matter), I am clearly qualified to weigh in with my uneducated guesses:
@proseimprint That's kind! I think I've located a copy, may turn back to you if not!
@BRAKiasaurus Pretty much positive PREPARATION is not eligible. Every now and then the NYT best of lists include a book that is a year old, for some reason. I'd be happy with BRAGGSVILLE taking it.
I think it's Braggsville, A Little Life, and Tsar with Braggsville taking it...unless Preparation for the Next Life is inexplicably eligible this year (as it was on the New York Times notable list), in which case it should go to that.
@W_Shadbolt @ey814 @myram319 Totally agree with W_Shadbolt. The Tsar read more like a novel. I realize that it doesn't focus on American Life, but there is a tiny bit in the end that I'm hoping will push it forward for consideration. It was my favorite followed by A Little Life.
@ey814 @proseimprint Well it looks like your post has stirred up the hornets nest. I have an extra copy of Delicious Food if your interested.
@Guardiands I almost chose FATE over LITTLE LIFE for a finalist. Again, it's another book that could make a run at the prize.
I have enjoyed reading all the comments here but want to toss my vote to A Little Life. Also, I am very disappointed that A Reunion of Ghosts by Judith Claire Mitchell was overlooked. As we look to next year I would hope that something as simple as Dawn of Wonder or The Life We Bury, both written by Debut Novelists, will get serious attention. Respectfully...
@myram319 I haven't read nearly enough to make any really educated guesses, but I enjoyed Tsar a lot more than The Sellout and am rooting for it as well. I think we'll see A Little Life on there as well, but although Johnson is one of my favorite contemporaries, I don't see his follow up to Orphan Master being a finalist. If they want a short story collection, McCann is a good choice.
@proseimprint @ey814 I think Did You Ever Have a Family sort of faded from view since it came out early in the year, and agree it could be a finalist. Wishing I'd read Delicious Foods. Now scrambling to find a first edition of it, just in case!
@AlexKerner I agree that it is a book that will stand out for this year, for all the reasons you've articulated, after other books have faded from mind. It's why I included it as a finalist, but I wouldn't at all be surprised if it won.
Fortune Smiles is what I want to pick, but I honestly don't see it happening. Then I was thinking (and wanting) Tsar, but I think they will stress the American emphasis this year. I haven't finished The Sellout yet, but I think that it will be a finalist with Fates, with Did You Ever Have a Family winning it all.
so my pick is going to be A Little Life.
I would be happy to see The Sellout win. It was a brilliantly witty and timely book that can rightfully be considered a big "I" IMPORTANT book that we will be talking about for many years to come.
@AlexKerner @GeorgeKing1 @jfieds2 Okay, so let me try to objectively evaluate the utility of the TOB to predict the Pulitzer. I'll honestly try to be objective! (And, I would note, I think the TOB is a fun exercise and I follow it each year.)
Just finished Hulse's "Black River" and simply adored the book. So pretty, overall, and much like the Kent Haruf novels, such as "Plainsong" that I've enjoyed over the years. "Black River" is surely one of the best five I've read this year. Solid Pulitzer choice, in my opinion. Side note: As I've mentioned before, I surely don't understand all of the hoopla surrounding "The Sellout," with so many other worthy contenders. But, what do I know? I'm only a reader. :-) Read on ...
And, since people always ask, here are the next 10:
@BRAKiasaurus Great news! I loved the book, and it's certainly deserving. So much better than the "top faves," I believe.
@GeorgeKing1 @jfieds2 @AlexKerner The Tournament of Books (sorry shouldn't have used the acronym). It's a competition that is run by The Morning News website annually. They choose the top 16 books (according to their committee I guess) and then pair them off in brackets (like the March Madness in basketball). Each pairing is judged by one person, who decides which book moves on.
@jfieds2 @AlexKerner maybe silly but any more silly than a jury of three or five doing the same? I think one of the motivations of starting the TOB was the absurdity of book competitions in general (which we all love) and taking it to its logical conclusion...battle to the death with zombies :)
So the Tournament of Books is down to its finals, with The Turner House going up against The Sellout. It has been a really intense year and the discussion boards for the A Little Life decisions were quite amazing in the scope of discussion. I realize that TOB isn't in the statistical model but it still has been quite predictive with the winner or finalist often winning the Pulitzer.
I spent an hour or two last week searching online databases (abe, bookfinder, thriftbooks, etc.) for used hardcover copies of The Sellout. Anytime I found one, I called the business and asked if they could pull the book from the shelf and read the number line to me. Finally, it paid off. Coas Books in New Mexico had a copy for $7.39. I ordered it and it just arrived. It's a near fine 1st printing!
@JohnZ @ey814 @jfieds2 JohnZ do you think that because the Pulitzer Prize web pages have been stressing that this is the 100th Pulitzers that the American theme might be very important for all the winners this year.
As for Hamilton, at this point wouldnt it be considered a just weird that it did not win.
The notes and telegrams are quite interesting, in that one may find lists of books and collections that were considered, as well as reasons for why some of them did not find a slot as regards the three finalists. Sometimes one may glean the cheerleading that was done for a particular book or collection (i.e., So Big; Tales from the South Pacific). There was also a year when James Alan McPherson made note of Robert Pirsig's Lila: An Inquiry into Morals. The winner that year, however, was Jane Smiley's A Thousand Acres.
Given that the last couple of winners for Fiction were also bestsellers (meaning they were well on the radar of the reading public), I'm wondering if the jury and board will this year opt for a winner that stands beyond the limelight -- that is, until it's announced as a winner.
@MH631 Wow. I'm completely gobsmacked and envious! So cool. I would love to see some of those. The Reivers signed to his mistress and her daughter the day before he died has got to be pretty close to the ultimate version of that one! This confirms that we have to figure out some opportunity for collectors to get together somewhere or sometime and compare notes, swap extras, etc.! Thanks for posting this!
As for the Sotheby's auction, go up to the top of the page and check the mast on the left. There's a link for it... and you're right, the minimum was not met.
The American Academy of Arts and Letters announced their 2016 Literature Award Winners. This isn't one of the predictor variables (though I'll have to see if I can find information about past winners, might be able to include it if it goes back far enough), but some familiar names are on the list:
@jfieds2 Not sure, but it can't be much earlier than that just due to the number of books needing to be read.
If I win the lottery we will all go. You get a 1st edition etc. Think Oprah you get a car, you get a car, to infinity and beyond.
Forgot to mention...While you're waiting for the 2016ers, you may enjoy the Pulitzer take on March Madness, Pulitzer Madness, a very quick survey: Choose your favorite Pulitzer-winning novel, in each of four regions: bit.ly/FictionMdnss
@jfieds2 We cannot offer any specifics but can tell you the various juries meet at different times throughout the year. We aim to give the Board as much time as we can.
@ey814 We are so appreciative to have great fans like you. We will certainly share your requests with the Board but unfortunately cannot guarantee any outcome.
And please feel free to let us know what discussions arise. We like the feedback, and it's fun too.
@AlexKerner Thanks for the smart thinking! You will be please to know that's exactly what we're doing - waiting until after the complete announcement to post the list on the site.
You will be able to watch from the pulitzer.org site itself, or on our YouTube channel, or on Facebook, which will be a different feed. Your choice.
@PulitzerPrizes @pulitzerprize also can i recommend that you don't post the winners on your website until AFTER the live streaming. Last year people were already shouting out the winners before the presenter had made the announcement because the winners had been posted on the site right away. For suspense purposes it would be great if that doesn't happen this year.
@OneMoreBook My sense is that any of these you mention have a shot. Sellout got the bulk of the points, but I think this year is as wide open as I can recall. I'm just finishing Turner House, and like it a lot. I have Eileen and Tsar teed up to read next!
Good luck with this year's process, if the discussion thread is any indication, this will be a good year with a difficult decision to be made!
The 2016 Prizes will be announced April 18 at 3pm ET.
@OneMoreBook I could not agree more. I am hanging onto my first edition it case it wins, and if it doesn't it'll go straight into a Little Free Library.
I really don't understand all of the hoopla over THE SELLOUT. Just a so-so book, in my opinion. Minor work. I struggled through it, and can never get back the time spent on that tome. EILEEN and HONEYDEW are sooooooo much better, not to mention THE TURNER HOUSE, TSAR, DID YOU EVER, and others. I'm reading DELICIOUS FOODS right now, and think it's a major-serious contender as well. BLACK RIVER is next on my list, and I can't wait. But, what do I know? :-) Read on ...
@BRAKiasaurus It's usually early March, just doesn't really get much publicity, so you have to look for it!
@BRAKiasaurus @Marybethking @jfieds2 Thanks, jfieds2! Because of you I now have a first edition of the book. I just wanted to read it, but couldn't find it in my area. The closest library that had a copy was 3 1/2 hours away. So I purchased a used book at a goodwill store online, and was surprised to get what appears to be an unread (new) copy of the first printing.
@jfieds2 I had just started following this group a couple weeks before reading your post. I picked it up a couple of days later, thought it was the best book of the year until I read Tsar. If The Sympathizer wins The PEN/Faulkner that will make the Pulitzer a little more interesting.
I am not much for "tooting my own horn" buuuuuuut, you did hear it here first: http://fyre.it/PfcL8m. (July 12, 2015). If I'm right, I bet it's a once in a lifetime prediction, at least that far in advance.
I'll run the final analysis when the PEN/Faulkner announcement is made, but I suggest collectors seek out a 1st edition of The Sellout, as it will be firmly in 1st place.
At some point, however, the idea of reading the list in reverse came to me. The idea of traveling back in time, as it were, and gleaning social context and possible cultural aesthetics, were too fascinating to pass up.
But it's the surprises that really enervated me and kept me reading through to the end (or should it be, the beginning?). Well... the fact that I can be stubborn didn't hurt, either (ha ha).
That said, there's no book I wouldn't recommend in the list (albeit some with reservations). After all, the great thing about reading (or any other artistic medium, really) is that we have an opportunity to consider the world and ourselves from perspectives often dissimilar to our own. And that's not bad at all. In fact, it's how we grow as individuals.
@ey814 Also, thank you for posting the list! The website is set up strangely--the announcement almost gets buried--but I would have completely missed it. I feel like it often comes later in the year? But maybe I'm thinking of a different award...
@ey814 why is this year an outlier in terms of its impact on the list?
Right, i'm putting two lotteries on this weekend.
On the minus side, there was no jacket on His Family, and So Big had one of those ugly dust jackets from 1958. Years of Grace was an early printing in early dust jacket, but signed. South Pacifc had a later DJ, and there were a few other later jackets as well. I wrote about it here:
Overall I thought it was a nice collection.
@JohnZ I thought about you when I posted the URL, knowing you had recently finished the entire run. I've ready every Pulitzer from Confederacy of Dunces (1980), and then about 1/3 of the books before 1980, but not reading in any order, just whatever strikes me. I intende to read them all, though Cheever's Collected Stories and Mailer's Executioner's Song will undoubtedly be last, given how long they are!
I try my best to find Pulitzers with DJs but it's nearly impossible to find the earlier ones with DJs without paying an arm and a leg. I would say over half of my 1st printings have DJs.
I've had some luck with finding a few 1st editions at Half Price Books. I picked up a copy of Advise & Consent for $15. I would highly recommend this place for new collectors. They have a rare books section too.
Did anyone know what happened to that Sotheby auction a few years back? Did the seller end up selling his collection at another auction? I vaguely remembered that the minimum was not met.
@MC74 @ChrisEllis77 @ey814 I also get excited each year on the run up to the announcement, but I am finding in recent years I have already read the winner, takes a little from it, don't you think.
As for Lamb in His Bosom you need a lot of luck and a pile of cash, I know its very rare.
Posts like these inspire me and are a driving force behind my recent goal in collecting and reading quality literature. Thank you.
Often, instead of reading the first book presented in the list (Ernest Poole's "His Family"), I worked backward -- a sensation that made me feel as if I were traveling back in time. Early in my reading, I did skip around, focusing on those books I already had sitting on my bookshelves. Eventually, though -- after pinching pennies and locating titles that were harder to find -- I had every Pulitzer-winner, which was when it occurred to me to begin my time-travel reverse reading.
@ey814 Nice article, reading them is the easy bit, it's finding them in first edition form, I too have read them all, however only own about half.
But my point is that maybe the American life theme is still a lot more important for the Pulitzer than we're thinking after ATLWCS and TOMS.
(As a side note, I don't think either Marra or Beatty will win the NBCC. Ferrante has a lot going for her, it will be tough to beat her this year.)
I meant to make that a smiley face, haha, not a frown!
@W_Shadbolt Been meaning to respond for a while, just traveling too much. With regard to the "Pulitzer in recognition of a body of work" situation, it shouldn't happen, but it clearly has. The jury letter for Eudora Welty's Optimist's Daughter specifically said that the book was among the best, but that Ms. Welty should have won the Pulitzer for a prior book, so they might as well give it to her now. I think that it could play a role next year with DeLillo, if Zero K is any good at all.
Since the update was kind of tucked into a comment on a thread, just a heads up to anyone interested: The 2017 forum was kindly opened (by, I believe, tklein27) and is already in motion. :(
@BRAKiasaurus This was one of the monthly selections from Book Passage out your way for the signed first edition club, so I'm guessing she is local to you. The PEN/Faulkner isn't a very good predictor of the Pulitzer... this will help Delicious foods in the rankings and, to a lesser degree, The Sympathizer, otherwise not so much.
@ey814 Very interesting selection! I have most of those books at home--and I keep looking at "Mendocino Fire" in the store (I think she's relatively local, so a lot of signed copies floating around). Thanks for the heads up! I figured it was happening today, actually, and then totally forgot to check, hahaha
@proseimprint @jfieds2 @tklein27 Yes, it already looks to be a strong year, and the 2017 page is now ready for action...
@BRAKiasaurus nevermind, it's called scrolling!! Couldn't find the novel when I googled him though.
First time poster, longtime reader of this blog.Thank you for providing such an interesting forum! I check in here religiously.
@BRAKiasaurus Yes, you are correct Mr Shearer is British and therefore not eligible. I would also be interested to know who would replace him.
My money is on The Tsar of Love and Techno.
So my "first edition" is probably a "fifth edition", which is a bit depressing. But still worth $20 and the short lived excitement of thinking I had a first edition.
So much to learn though. Love this place.
I think Alex Shearer is a british novelist. If so, does this bump him from the list? If he were to fall off the list (due to citizenship) who would supplant him?
350 for The Sellout is a farce.
@jfieds2 @tklein27 I enjoy the involvement of this post. This is going to be a strong year. Having read "What belongs To You," "Young Blood," "Ways to Disappear," all very good books but four others have so far stood out for me "The Vegetarian," "Free Men," "Tender" and "Poor Your Soul." I am ready now for the heavy hitters for me stating this month with "Gone With the Mind," "The Association of Small Bombs," and "Innocents and Others."
Yes, good idea. I'll get a new page up very soon.
@tklein27 I'd say it's almost time to open a new message board! I forget if you have normally waited for one year to be total "over," (with an announcement of the price) but many 2017 contenders are coming out soon!
@AlexKerner @BRAKiasaurus I can't find it--I keep looking. She was just at book passage. I would recommend looking at the upcoming schedule for bookstores near you. I know she's going to greenlight books, book passage, etc.
Hanya Yanagihara is finally doing a book tour, by the way, for the paperback edition.
Just finished The Sellout. I liked it a lot but at times it seemed a little uneven. Some jokes also fell flat, and when Beatty kept going off the narrative tracks to simply make some of these jokes, it got annoying. Still, this wasn't too big a problem, I'd probably give it a 4/5.
Also, if anyone is looking for a break from the hunt; check out 'Perfect Days.' Raphael Montes I believe?
@proseimprint Oh, very nice. This is a report I read once in a google book (published by university press or another)...and while I completely disagree with their assessment of "Rabbit, Run", the title of which they didn't even record accurately, I think Lee probably did deserve the award.
Had it been another year, I probably would have given it to Updike.
Also worth noting: their dismissal of "A Separate Peace" due to its length. I'm glad to see other juries haven't considered this a point of contention (see: Train Dreams, Tinkers, etc.)
It's possible that the publisher felt it too regional to do well in sales but wanted to give his voice a chance. Only 100 pages in, but if you liked the above authors, I definitely recommend it.
(In all honesty, as well-written as it is, it is also a relief to read after much of my recent lineup: "Preparation for the Next Life", "We Are Not Ourselves", "Between the World and Me", "A Little Life", "The Sellout"...with the exception of a couple reads, like "Undermajordomo Minor", it has been a heavy year.)
Thank you to the Pulitzer for sharing this wonderful article http://www.pulitzer.org/article/14174
@ChrisEllis77 - Same here. I've been looking for a 1st printing for the past few weeks and no luck. A copy sold on eBay for $350 last week.
On a separate note, I am trying to complete my Pulitzer collection. If anyone on the board knows where I could get a 1st copy of Lamb in His Bosom (at a reasonable price, not the $7500 copy of Abebooks), I would be forever indebted to you. I enjoy reading everyone's post. Keep up the good work.
@jfieds2 Enjoying this book, but it isn't necessarily an award winner. Reminds me a little of the pleasure I received, though, from reading "The Imperfectionists" (which, actually, was a much more perfect book). Strong writing.
@ChrisEllis77 I might be down. Need to finish reading it first, though.
@Marybethking I totally agree with you regarding A Little Life. 110%
Hello all, I am just wondering if anyone has a 1st printing of The Sellout they wish to sell. I understand this is a long shot but if there is anyone out there let me know. Thanks.
Another book I'm looking forward to: https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/amy-gustine/you-should-pity-us-instead/
@BRAKiasaurus It's also a paperback original right? That would be an interesting winner!
Okay, just sent the next list to Tom to post. Here it is:
Nothing new is announced (predictor variable-wise) until March, so this is it for the rest of the month.
@OneMoreBook I'll have to part ways with you on Braggsville and Sellout, but I'm on board with Turner House. I'm 1/4 way through it, and like it a lot. I agree that Johnson is unlikely to win another Pulitzer so soon, or for a short story collection.
Things changed over the years, The line of beauty is not less explicit than The folding star, but 10 years later that wasn't a problem to win the Booker.
Anyway, what belongs to you has more things against it, it's located in Bulgaria, and being released in january makes more difficult to reach awards season with the hype intact
@worldbfreeheel I believe last year's finalists were announced March 10th (which was later, if I recall correctly, than previous years). I'm not sure why they hold it so close to the vest.
@jfieds2 @TELyles @BRAKiasaurus @ey814 I have it on my shelf--possibly on your recommendation jfieds--not sure! But I still look forward to reading it. I like to support debut novelists. Kind of fun to find new people to get excited about...and on occasion, it puts you ahead of the crowd sometimes (which is why I have a first edition of "Preparation for the Next Life").
@jjose712 @AlexKerner We have had some controversy on this thread earlier about gay themes, etc. We have not touched on the graphic sexual aspect of novels, however. My guess is that that is not a factor in whether awards are won or lost, honestly. Just as Updike won twice for his often-explicit "Rabbit" novels, it comes down to the writing itself and how it contributes to the narrative of the characters.
Anyway, after reading a quick sample of the writing--and given the price--I bought it on Amazon. It sounds promising, so I'll keep everyone posted.
@AlexKerner @jfieds2 I was almost going to delete my comment! I am feeling grouchy today. It does look like the kind of book that could be a finalist for multiple awards...
While I get you may not want to spend 500pp on a book, the buzz around this has been pretty off the charts so I wouldn't be so quick to dismiss.
so totally skipping ahead to 2017...Alexander Chee's The Queen of the Night has gotten tons of buzz and comes out today and is an early favourite for next year's award
@TELyles @OneMoreBook Completely disagree about "Braggsville". Of the books I've read this year, it remains my favorite and the most deserving. But I do find "The Sellout" both brilliant and challenging...it jumps into its fast-paced, allusion-laced, comedic monologue in a way that, frankly, took some acclimating. But once you muscle through the prologue, it smooths out.
@OneMoreBook Have you read the Marra? I am halfway through the stories and if they had any link to "American life" then that would be my pick, without any reservation.
I barely made it through WELCOME TO BRAGGSVILLE. Ugh. Frankly, it wore me out, reading the tome. I gave up completely on THE SELLOUT, even before the end of the 29-page prologue. Both were way too cumbersome. My favorite so far, for the Pulitzer? THE TURNER HOUSE. The Clegg and Johnson books were just "OK" for me, but I can't believe we'll have a repeat winner with Johnson this year. Still waiting for a book to "wow" me.
@W_Shadbolt @ey814 if I recall, this tends to be a good indicator (much like the NBCC), but it isn't a deal maker or breaker.
@ey814 Interesting to see "Black River" and "Delicious Foods" show up again. I feel like those two were mentioned a lot early in 2015 and haven't been discussed much since.
I think Alvar is in fact a citizen.
Otherwise, this list is pretty much expected. No real surprises this year. :)
Will this be the final list, or is there one more after?
I'll run the numbers for the next list late next week, but clearly The Sellout is likely to be at the top of the list, followed by Fates and Furies, then Little Life, then Fortune Smiles (again, I'm just eye-balling this). Somewhat surprised that Purity isn't on the ALA list. Same with Braggsville.
If Sellout wins the NBCC, that may seal the deal for it. If not, it's a closer race.
@Guardiands Here's some details about the first edition.
Will be surprised if "A Little Life" isn't among the finalists.
@Guardiands I have one--if anyone wants me to keep an eye out, happy to do so.
I'm about 60 pages into "The Sellout" and I understand the acclaim. So far, I enjoyed "Braggsville" more, but I'll keep you posted.
My guess about the finalists at this point is:
I think I'd rather see a relevant novel win the award. So far, my favorite has been "Braggsville", which I read as soon as it was published last February. It remains the strongest book I've read.
The Story Prize, now in its 12th year, is pleased to honor as its finalists three outstanding short story collections chosen from 100 submissions representing 64 different publishers or imprints. They are:
And the spotlight award has also been given, this year to a graphic novelist:
Now I wonder if my 1st edition i bought on eBay is legit....
As for the Marra, it didn't happen last year, but the two years before that this board was going crazy over Anne Frank and The Son, both of which wound up being finalists. I've seen a bit of buzz about him on here, I wonder if he'll be nominated.
I think you two bring up good points about the characters, the nature of their friendships and their, eventual, success in the fields of their choosing. Unrealistic? Yes, but I'm willing to go where the author takes me. For instance, I doubt that Jude would lack formal education and suffer years of abuse, only to be accepted into a good college, matriculate into an Ivy law school, obtain an advanced math degree at the same time, while simultaneously working at a bakery where he becomes an excellent baker, on top of being an exemplary cook. But this is where we are taken, so I will go along with the ride.
My main issue with A Little Life is more technical. Harold's letters to Willem drew me out of the story whenever they would pop up. I felt they disrupted from the flow of the overall story and I struggled to understand their place in the narrative.
End of the day, I'm glad I read the novel but it is not one I could universally recommend
@BRAKiasaurus I think it would be hard to give it the Pulitzer... it's so unrelenting. I can't think of any prior winner even remotely like it. But, I'm not betting against it!
@ey814 Would you give it the pulitzer? I think it may well be a finalist, so I'm curious whether the jury would ultimately choose it.
As to the extreme success and wealth of all characters, I noticed that as well. It did strike me as an intentional choice, though. Any thoughts on why she made the choice?
@BRAKiasaurus Yeah, I agree. The only book I really questioned being on the list at all was Billy Lynn's Long Halftime Walk, which I liked, but wouldn't put in the 12 greatest books of the 21st Century!
@ey814 The order of this is wild, to me. Every single novel is definitely very good, but I'm shocked that the number 1 is Diaz's novel. Interesting choices, though. Would like to read "Half of a Yellow Sun".
@AlexKerner Some interesting novels on here, including some I haven't yet read or heard much about. I somehow doubt we'll see many surprises this year (although I do feel like the pulitzers have been really strange the past few years...with the missing award, the three finalists / fourth winner, and the goldfinch--a decent but problematic novel--chosen against a particularly strong year of novels), but I bet most of these novels are pretty solid.
Worth noting: "Oreo" is in contention, but if I"m not mistaken, that novel came out originally in the 70s. Not sure if it qualifies for the pulitzer as a result (which is almost odd, given that a short story collection that contains even one new story or new title will qualify)...any thoughts? I hear it is a very good novel.
An interesting list of the 12 "greatest novels of the 21st Century" (so, since 2000) compiled by BBC Culture contributor Jane Ciabattari. The methodology probably accounts for the domination of US authors (polled several dozen book critics, most of whom looked to be from US outlets--not sure why more British critics weren't included. But, among the 12 listed, six won the Pulitzer and one was a Pulitzer finalist. Another Pulitzer winner was a runner-up. We sometimes talk about whether the Pulitzer recognizes the very best novels, but according to these critics, it seems to do a pretty good job!
Sorry about the outage. Should be okay now.
By the way, this happened: http://pen.org/2016-pen-literary-awards-longlists
@BRAKiasaurus Am i the only one who don't love the flamethrowers? Don't get me wrong, i think it's a good novel and i love Kushner's writing but i loved Telex from Cuba so much that The Flamethrowers was a bit dissapointing.
I can't have an opinion of this year's candidates. Fates and furies will be published here in Spain this year, but it won't be published till at least April
@ey814 @BRAKiasaurus It wasn't me--but thank you. :)
@ey814 @BRAKiasaurus Agree, although I am curious if the fact of the election (apparently publishers often withhold some books until after the election, since that dominates coverage and, for that matter, accounts for many of readers' purchases) will make 2017 a big year of wonderful fiction. We saw this play out in 2013. But I agree. This may mean that the books that get the most attention are by authors which already have a readership, a following. Premature to say such things, but the aforementioned authors are ripe for pulitzers.
@ey814 @BRAKiasaurus Agree about Gates. Bought it as soon as it came out but haven't had a chance to dive into it yet. Wood's endorsement is reason enough for me. I just need to finish up "Refund" and some other collections I'm in the middle of. This received endlessly strong reviews when it came out, and I think it bears watching.
Not a good indicator for Pulitzers (he did not like The Goldfinch, for example, felt The Flamethrowers to be masterful--and, let's be honest, The Flamethrowers probably should have been a finalist that year), but he is a wonderful and astute critic who I agree with more often than not:
Didn't realize it until this list, but Annie Proulx has a new novel out--and it's a big one! "Barkskins: A Novel"
@Guardiands See some of my thoughts regarding "A Little Life" in the comment section above :)
They also bring up why it is called "A Little Life", reminding me who first says the phrase, and then why the phrase--applied more broadly to the themes of the novel--was used as the title. I don't want to give away any spoilers, but it made me really appreciate the novel in some ways. It is a very thoughtful choice--we can discuss more when you're finished.
I must say that, while I won't recommend this novel to anyone, I think it was powerful. It felt to me like performance art, something I endured, an artistic experience which divides people but is undeniably compelling.
@BRAKiasaurus @ey814 I'm 500 pages into it. Brutal. One thing that I'm not really buying is that the people in Jude's life remain as loyal to him as all of them are... I don't care how kind and generous you are, supporting someone with as many issues as does Jude takes a toll after 15-30 years. The friendships don't feel very reciprocal, which make it hard to maintain a friendship.
@Marybethking I haven't heard anything about her having a new book out...this surprises me, honestly, given how crazy the world went for "Gone Girl" (a novel I admittedly didn't think much of). Are you referring to The Grownup? I think that may in fact be a re-issue of an older work.
@ey814 @BRAKiasaurus So (as I have this week off) I'm now almost 600 pages through, and it only gets worse... -_- This is a rough book to binge read. My next novel will need to be something a bit lighter...at the very least, short stories.
@BRAKiasaurus I'm at about the same place in the book... devastating is the right descriptor.
Essentially, winning the Pulitzer more than once is very rare, so once you've won it, having done so counts against you for future wins, and, apparently, not many people who are one-time finalists actually go on to win for another book. Even though McDermott, DeLillo, and Oates are multiple-finalists, that is a pretty insignificant variable in the long run, mainly because so few people have been finalists more than once since 1982 (when my database begins).
By the way, thanks for the first list!
Also, 250 pages into "A Little Life"--hard to read and yet hard to put down. Really devastating after about 65 pages in...
Lucia Berlin may also turn out to be a strong contender. Been awhile since we've seen a posthumous award.
Okay, here we go. This is the first prediction list for the 2016 Pulitzer Prize. Bear in mind the following:
1. It's early. Most of the annual awards that are good predictor variables have not been given out nor finalists announced.
2. This list essentially uses data from the NYTimes best of lists, the National Book Award finalists/winner, and from the author's previous history with regard to awards (e.g., prior winner of an award, prior finalist, etc.).
3. There are 75 books entered for consideration right now, drawn from discussions on this site, best of lists, and award announcements to date. There will be more added as they emerge in other award lists, I'm sure.
Some observations on why these books ended up in the top 15.
2. Fortune Smiles presence near the top should be self-evident.
3. Perhaps the most interesting entry here is A Manual for Cleaning Women by Lucia Berlin. This is a posthumously published collection of short stories that was on the NY Times 100 best and made their top 10 list.
12. Morrison has a slew of past awards and nominations, so pretty much anything she publishes will put her on the list until more awards come out for current year books.
Other books that have gotten some attention on this list and where they are now:
Very cool that you live there! I'll reach out to them, but I suppose I can also just be patient, haha. If you are ever in the states, I would also be happy to send you some books but totally get the cist of overseas shipping...it can get pricy!
I just finished Gillian Flynn's new book and thought it was really good.
@BRAKiasaurus Hi, I would in normal circumstances be happy to past it on or swap it, but I live in Norway in Scandinavia, so I guess the postage is a big cost, however I know Powells in Portland have had a few, maybe if you contact them you could arrange a swap or through my experience with them, they may just give you one. Hope it's some help.
I may be one of the few here who has not yet read any of the Erdrich novels. Need to get on that--I own them both.
I have to say: it is always wonderful to find that a new favorite author is also fairly prolific! This seems true of Geronimo Johnson (who said at a reading that he wrote two novels after "hold it till it hurts"--of which "braggsville" was one (so expect another from him relatively soon, I guess). Marra is another! This is great news!
Chriselliot, would you be willing to pass on that ARC to me? I would be happy to swap as I have a number of ARCs from 2015. Just let me know! (Same goes for anyone else. I'd love to get some swaps happening here.)
@ey814 I didn't know 'The Round House' was a series. I'm going to have to check this out.
@BRAKiasaurus Can't believe I forgot this one:
Third in the trilogy by Louise Erdrich. The first one (Plague Doves) was a Pulitzer finalist, second one (Round House) won the National Book Award (and, in my opinion, should have won the Pulitzer). If this is as good as those two were and as it sounds, I have high expectations for it.
@BRAKiasaurus I have an ARC of Tuesday Nights in 1980 by Molly Prentiss, it's very well written and a great read, I can easily see this being a contender, very popular at the very least.
@BRAKiasaurus Looks like this is drawn just from best of lists, which are, of course, helpful, but not all that reliable as a predictor on their own. Agree though that the top books will likely be at the top of our list as well. I plan to do the first list next week, so we'll see.
@myram319 @BRAKiasaurus I saw Russo last year, and asked him what he was working on and he mentioned the sequel to Nobody's Fool, so I'm very much looking forward to this... as well as the Marra.
Not to get ahead of the group here--I'm only just now 200 pages into "A Little Life", a book I've found hard to put down so far, so I clearly have plenty to read from 2015--but I have a few 2016 books that I'm getting excited about:
Anyone else looking forward to next year's releasees? I'm particularly excited about Jansma and Prentiss. Bock and Delillo could be good, although I never know what type of book the latter will release. Haslett sounds like he has written something beautiful (along the lines of the short stories in his debut collection), so I will be keeping my eye on that one. (I may have to be pretty selective about my reading in 2016 / 17. New baby on the way! I imagine that will take away some of my reading time, hahaha)
Anyway, anyone else have books they're looking forward to?
Will we have a prediction list in the coming weeks?
Vaguely reminds me of what we got goin' on on this site...albeit more data goes into the stuff here. That said, it would surprise me if we don't see both of the books atop that list as finalists for this year's pulitzer.
This is interesting (scroll down for books): http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/judging-by-best-of-lists-kendrick-lamar-was-2015s-cultural-icon/
@wadamreed @JohnZ @W_Shadbolt Your question is a tough one to answer. I enjoyed many of the Pulitzer winners, with a few here and there which didn't particularly appeal to me. Also, one has to consider that what he or she looks for in a novel or collection may not be that for which others look. Aesthetics and art, you know.
Bearing that in mind, here is a list of those winners which have stayed in my memory. The first two are my favorites of all the winners; those following are listed in no particular order
I know -- it's more than ten. But these are the ones that gave me hours of both enjoyment and contemplation.
100 pages into "A Little Life" and enjoying it a lot. Might just be a nice break from the measured, largely internal Clegg novel. I haven't gotten to the overwhelmingly depressing things I keep hearing about, so I'll keep you posted.
As for Vollman, who knows? Certainly he's a dynamic writer. I thought Europe Central might have had a chance -- if not as the work chosen for the prize during its year, then perhaps as a finalist.
Just this year, the board asked the jurors to provide a fourth title for consideration. As it was, the jury nominated Lovely, Dark, Deep; Let Me Be Frank With You; and The Moor's Account. One guesses the fourth title added -- All the Light We Cannot See -- was the eventual winner. (Maybe the board didn't want another ruckus, given to the wrath it incurred in 2011.)
As of late (i.e., the past two years), the board appears to be opting for more general fair. To be clear, neither of the last two novels to have won are bad novels (not to me, at least); however, they were nothing near obscure. Which is something that has happened in the past as regards the Pulitzer. Gone with the Wind won, after all.
Having read all of the Pulitzer winners in Fiction, I'd agree that the jury and board have mostly made choices that aren't embarrassing for them. Most of the novels and collections are good. Some are even great.
Agree with you about Welcome to Braggsville. I think it may well be a finalist, if not the winner.
I'm half-way through A Little Life. Talk about your bleakness piled on bleakness! I dunno, it seems a bit much so far, but it is a rich rendering of human thought and perception, if not a big overwrought on that. I'm interested in seeing where the last half leads!
At this point, Welcome to Braggsville may be my favorite novel of the year.
I enjoyed it, I didn't find the stove aspect too unbelievable. But given your view of that book, I look forward to your thoughts on A Little Life. That book I objectively was thinking "nope, not buying it" the whole time.
I don't think it deserves the pulitzer, but I would read his future endeavors. I think Clegg has it in him to write a great novel, but I'm not sure this one is as flawless as I would want from the pulitzer winner.
That said, I wonder what others think of this:
I did not read his review until after I finished the novel.
I have a few short story collections to finish and then will start "A Little Life", I think.
this is an interesting piece about the backlash some of the bigger books have faced this year
As we here will recall, she was on the jury during a particularly controversial year.
@AlexKerner @ey814 @BRAKiasaurus I think Prep still stacks up as one of the strongest books of this year or the last. Be amazing to see it win, but yes, the Nov. 2014 first run of the book had me confused. :)
Unlike past years, the list spotlights a few books that haven't gotten much attention, at all. I think that is great, but overall the list is not helpful to us, especially since 2 of 5 are translations. (One of those two certainly DID receive a lot of attention, though.)
The final two on the list are both ones that we have talked about: MANUALS FOR CLEANING WOMEN and THE SELLOUT. For me, THE SELLOUT is still my personal front runner, even as I have wanted to love other books more. Satire is not my thing, so I had high hopes to find a strong contender with a different kind of story in FATES AND FURIES and CITY ON FIRE (which I have tabled temporarily), but I'm not convinced either one will win.
@AlexKerner I'll make a note of this. Based on what I've read, the book doesn't much interest me, but it certainly is getting attention, on more than just the NYT list. I think it was on Buzzfeed (FWIW) and a few other lists so far.
so I just finished reading Delicious Foods and I think it deserves another little bump. It is a shame it hasn't made any award short lists yet but was on the NYTs 100 notable. It is really powerful and the writing is intense and particularly creative (one of the voices being that of crack cocaine).
@ey814 @kas1985 yeah I was a little disappointed but not surprised. Thought that maybe since B&N was an early supporter of the book, they might have some kicking around. David Mitchell signed firsts are probably worth grabbing, but I didn't buy any others.
I wonder how the B&N Goldfinch will fare on the market, and how many will try to pass it off.
@tklein27 @DustySpines @ey814 wow, I had not seen a signed one, but yes too rich for my blood. You could probably make a better investment with the $1500.
when is the first list coming out?
As you can see, it missed some pretty big books! Now, here are the books that won the Pulitzer (from 1982 onward) that were not on the NBCC finalist list:
This list still missed a couple of big ones (how could The Color Purple not show up on either list, one wonders), but still has a substantially better track record than does the NYT 10 Best.
I'm also shocked that "braggsville" and clegg's novel aren't on the list. I'm reading the latter now, and it's quite good.
Also of note: "Preparation for the Next Life" is on the list...does this mean it is eligible for the Pulitzer this year!?
Limited to 500 copies and sells for $1,500
@ey814 Thanks so much for the information. My copy has never been read and I would say that it is in Near Fine condition. I think I got it after I read someone else's hardcover, because the cost was less. I did the same with The Goldfinch. This was before I found out about Odyssey Bookstore's First Edition Club early this year. I'm extremely happy with their picks.
@ey814 @kas1985 I'm new to this, but was wondering if an Advanced Reader's Copy of ALL THE LIGHT is worth hanging on to. I didn't buy the actual hardcover of it.
@BRAKiasaurus Late to the game with this post, but I was rooting for Ta-Nehisi Coates' BETWEEN THE WORLD AND ME, which, of course, did win. I think it's an important book (I think we had a discussion about this earlier in the thread, just don't remember!).
Thanks!! I am also putting ALA for the win. People in the trees was brilliant too, not sure why it didn't receive as much attention?
@BRAKiasaurus Thanks for the recommendations! I own American Pastoral so I'll start there.
Has there been a discussion of this year's Barnes and Noble signed first editions? All the light we Cannot See is among them if I remember correctly. I wonder what these versions do to the market value. Also, it means B&N has a warehouse of first printings of Pulitzer prize winners they can throw on the market at any time. @ey814 take notice... I remember you saying you thought the B&N Goldfish was printed on inferior paper--I didn't notice that myself.
@BRAKiasaurus @AlexKerner @ey814 Compassionate is a great word. He is a funny guy and seems like a very nice man. The collection was terrific in my opinion. Couldn't have happened to a nicer guy, though Groff was really really personable when I chatted with her at the Brooklyn book festival this year so I was pulling for her. Had signed ARC and hardback of Refund so the collector in me was pulling for that.
@ey814 Oh! I thought maybe that was what you were aiming for but I threw that out there anyway.
Washington Post has its list of 10 best of 2015 out. "Braggsville" (my pick for this year's pulitzer winner) is on the list as is "A Little Life". A book we haven't paid much attention "The Book of Aron" is also on the list.
I'm not sure how I missed that Adam Johnson had a new book out. He is one of my favorites. I wonder if his new book will take the pulitzer this year as well.
@AlexKerner @ey814 I really like hearing him talk. Looks like a football player, but has a soft compassionate voice and good sense of humor. Spoken with him a number of times (he's local to the Bay area), and he's awesome--haven't read his collection, but definitely happy for his good fortune (no pun intended).
Adam Johnson has had a pretty good couple of years. I'll have to see if I can figure out when the last time an author's back-to-back books won NBA or Pulitzer. But, I heard Adam Johnson read Nirvana from Fortune Smiles, and it was very good (and he was a very nice guy.)
I think that's great. I loved Fortune Smiles! I really, really, thought A Little Life was well written, but so over the top, so lacking in believability. I felt like it was a chore to get through it.
Fortune Smiles might be the best book I've read this year.
@jfieds2 so Fortune Smiles won. It was good but I have to say that I was not overwhelmed by it and thought it wasn't as good as Mara's collection. Kudos to Johnson though.
NBA prediction: A LITTLE LIFE takes it. It wouldn't be my choice -- I'd go with FORTUNE SMILES (I've read all but REFUND) -- but Yanagihara win. Although far from perfect, the book deals with some important "American" themes in important ways. Lately the NBA seems to pick a book that does that kind of thing more so than the Pulitzer.
Based on the past, winning the NBA also makes winning the Pulitzer less likely. I was pulling for FATES AND FURIES to become my front runner in the Pulitzer hunt, but after finishing it last night, although I enjoyed it, I don't think it's the one.
I do not know who runs the site or their formula, but if you look at the past "best of year" lists, then the site's owner has done a terrific job of identifying stand out fiction from that calendar year. I expect that the list will fluctuate as award season progresses and best of lists are published, but at the current time Sympathizer is right up there with several other books which have been more widely discussed on this site.
Has anyone read 'Gold, Fame, Citrus?' I just can't get into it despite good reviews.
@Marybethking Glad to hear from someone who read it! I haven't read it yet, but picked it up based purely on the fact that Clegg recommended (and is the agent for) it.
Has anyone read Stacy Schiff's latest? She is someone I always read, but I haven't gotten to that one yet.
@AlexKerner @kriscoffield I snagged "The Shore" from the library when you first brought it up, Alex--I didn't have time to read it, however, so it was returned. Thank you for reminding me! I was meaning to give it a second shot. :)
@kriscoffield @ChrisEllis77 Agree with you about 10:04, by the way. My list, as I recall was: Preparation for the Next Life, 10:04, and Fourth of July Creek--and honestly, I still think that is a much much much stronger list than the one initially submitted.
@kriscoffield my finalist would be A Little Life and Fates and Furies. I know people had issues with the former, but I found it heartbreaking and majestic in its emotional scope. There is a reason it is piling on the awards and shortlists and I imagine that the Pulitzer will have difficulty not acknowledging it, at least as part of the three finalists.
In terms of the third choice. I would like to say The Shore, again a really interesting novel that is as much about place as it is about characters and plot. It hasn't gotten as much attention as other books this season, but the Pulitzer always seems to chose one dark horse, so lets go with this one.
"A Little Life" and "The Sympathizer", but I don't know what other title. Maybe "Tsar" or "The Sellout".
Just for fun, what would be your finalists today, if you had to name them? We're a little more than halfway through the year. There is still good literature to come. Just trying to gauge to board, so to speak.
@Marybethking @ChrisEllis77 Not likely to be a pulitzer contender (nor should it be) but definitely worth more than 20 pages!! Maybe you'll pick it up at a later date. :) Worth a second try, I think.
@ChrisEllis77 You're a better man than I am. I made it to page 20 of 'City of FIre' and was annoyed by how heavy it was to return to the library
@ChrisEllis77 I'd push back on the idea that the Pulitzer is purely a popularity contest. Paul Harding's TINKERS (2010), for example, had such a small print run that few readers knew about it. The year's most popular books, by sales alone, are almost invariably (and by definition) popular fiction. Trade fiction.
I find several post-2000 (last 15 years) winners deserving of the award. For me, there's never "one book to rule them all." Rather, each year produces multiple works that pique my aesthetic, intellectual, and emotional interest. Some do so more than others; those are the books I find most worthy, particularly when they speak to an American theme (whatever that means in today's world).
So, to answer your question, I think the Pulitzer speaks to our communal need to narrate our times, values, humanity and lack thereof, and strengths and weaknesses as a society. Its relevance is in its ability to highlight how our individual stories pull society forward, or at least in new directions. I participate in this thread because it compels me to read the year's great writing. I'm also an aspiring author. Somewhat more aspirational than productive these days, but still.
So it leaves me to think, are we putting too much emphasises and time into the Pulitzer? Is it THAT special? Or is The Man Booker a better indicator of the years best novel? I think its more fair, includes the world not just the US, not forced into choosing the best campaign.
I have only read 200 pages of a loaned copy (my copy will be arriving in the form of Powells indiespensable) and I have to say I can see myself not getting to the end.
So what I am saying is, are we, being again led to the winner? The timing of the release of City of Fire, and campaign, smells really bad of a Pulitzer "wannabe"
@grahammyers @jfieds2 (Postscript: I'm so so so happy to have others with whom I can finally discuss this book. I procured an ARC and then had no one to talk to about the merits and downsides of the novel!)
@grahammyers @BRAKiasaurus @jfieds2 I actually think that opening couple of pages was my favorite bit of writing. It's a well-written novel; in fact, I may at some point even read it a second time now that I have slightly adjusted expectations (really didn't know what I was jumping into, honestly, and was hoping for something more literary, something closer to Delillo's work perhaps)...but I do wish that the novel had carried on like that introductory chapter.
2. "power transformers tilted up like weary crucifixes, shot through with rust and ice on the far side of a window he could see through only imperfectly, as he could remember the night only imperfectly."
this happens throughout the book so far. he could have cut the adjectives down and had a stronger novel.
@BRAKiasaurus I finished FATES AND FURIES a week and a half ago... my initial opinion was that it was well written, but I didn't think it had the heft, if you will, for the Pulitzer. In reflection, I'm beginning to change my mind and could see it as a strong contender. I haven't read LITTLE LIFE or FAMILY yet, so will see how I feel after I finish those.
From what I can tell, the award has only been around since 2012, so too recent for me to add as a predictor variable. I would note that the winners for the last two years were ALL THE LIGHT and GOLDFINCH, so they've hit on the last two. On the other hand, the first three medal winners were not even Pulitzer finalists.
Has anyone read "Against the Country"?
Man, oh, man, do I ever agree with you about short novels about big things! But I did love "Middlesex" and "Underworld" as well. "Tinkers", "Train Dreams", and others like it seem to have been replaced by the big novel. Just as Jhumpa Lahriri's win in 2000 saw a resurgence in the short story, I think two years ago, when all three finalists were HUGE novels, may have sparked a rebirth of the large novel. "The Luminaries", "We Are Not Ourselves", "The Dying Grass" (admittedly Vollmann has always written huge novels), "A Little Life", "The Goldfinch", "The Son", "The Woman Who Lost Her Soul", "A Brief History of Seven Killings", "City on Fire" are all fat tomes and each has received its share of accolades, hefty advances, prizes, etc.
From this year--without having read all the possible nominees--I would probably still hand it to "Welcome to Braggsville". But it seems like Groff, Yanagihara, and Clegg have written some very resonant novels that I intend to read in the coming months. (Doing everything I can to resist re-reading "Preparation for the Next Life" again.)
It's uneven. You may well enjoy it--and you are welcome to! I was hoping for a literary epic, and it has its moments, but it is also a mystery novel that never entirely pays off on that trope and genre. I honestly want to hear from someone who unabashedly loves the novel!
@BRAKiasaurus just started it also. hope it's better than what i've hearing, although it did get a good review in the NYT.
Did you finish it already? So much promise in that novel...definitely a letdown.
@BRAKiasaurus I think the first three you listed are from this blog the biggest contestants so I would go with any of them.
so let down by 'City on Fire.' a two million dollar advance, are you serious?!
"A Little Life" is one of the three finalists for the Carnegie Medal. It's appearing in almost every awards shortlist, it seems. It's competing against the novel I mentioned, "The Sympathizer". Call me crazy, but they're both in my slowly-shortening Pulitzer shortlist.
Despite its supposed shortcomings, something tells me "City of Fire" may end up being a finalist or something. There's a lot of good reviews behind it, and I hear the writing, though excessive, is very exceptional, and does a great job in evoking the time period. Maybe they'll overlook its flaws and consider its ambition. It kind of reminds me of "Underworld".
What does everyone think about The Sympathizer?
@JohnZ Yes, I sometimes do rewrite people's sentences. Not often pulitzer winners, but when I was 13, I read a Dean Koontz novel and rewrote it in my head the whole way. Then again, he's an awful writer....
@ey814 BtWaM is difficult, tiny, and so so important. Glad you read that wonderful book! I hope it wins a pulitzer, frankly, but I'm not entirely certain what category would have it. It could sneak into general nonfiction, but (like "A Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius" before it) it would be something of an outlier.
In any case, yes "Fates and Furies" would also be worth reading. And I might be able to do double duty on that one, as I got the audiobook from the library in addition to owning a signed copy.
By the way, did Yanagihara do a book tour? The "events" page on her publisher's page was never up-to-date, and I swear she seems to have forgone any sort of formal signings....but maybe I'm mistaken? Anyone else notice this?
As good as it is, there are some dangling modifiers that have me shaking my head. For instance:
"Antoinette was lying in the sun on the balcony in a black bikini and slash of red lipstick when Gaiwan came up the stairs carrying the family rocking chair."
Some punctuation would have cleared things up, don't you think?
"On the balcony, and clad in a black bikini and slash of red lipstick, Antoinette was lying in the sun when Gaiwan came up the stairs, carrying the family rocking chair."
"Wearing a black bikini and slash of red lipstick, Antionette was on the balcony and lying in the sun when Gawain, carrying the family rocking chair, came up the stairs."
Still, thus far with F & F, the pros are outweighing the cons. I wish I could say the same for A LITTLE LIFE. As it is, I'm still not impressed. Not only that, but Yanagihara loves her split infinitives. I say this not from a place of snobbishness, but from one of perplexity. Clearly, she's an able writer (if a bit detached and clinical), so one wonders why she wouldn't take more time to sculpt her sentences properly.
That said, I will continue to sing the praises of DID YOU EVER HAVE A FAMILY. (Funny side note: Ms. Groff's agent is none other than Bill Clegg.)
@BRAKiasaurus I'm envious of your reading consumption and speed! If UNDER MAJORDOMO MINOR is a bit of a lark, might set you up for something more serious... LITTLE LIFE seems to fit that bill, though if you read FATES AND FURIES now, you'll have it read before the NBA is anounced.
I read Between the World and Me ad couldn't agree more that it is an important (and soboring) book. I hope it wins the NBA for non-fiction.
I really love this place, thanks for all the suggestions.
Okay, so I have a question for everyone here, but I'd like to briefly preface it with a word about my current read.
Here's where I'm at: I'm about 20 pages away from the end of "Under Majordomo Minor", which isn't likely to win any awards but is simply great fun.
I have to say, this has been a fantastic year for books, a significant improvement from last year.
@grahammyers I agree re: ALL THE LIGHT, but still think that Robinson's LILA is the book that will still be read in 30 years and should have won. I did like Lish's book, though.
@JohnZ FAMILY is up next, almost done with FATES & FURIES. The latter is well written, but I agree with an earlier comment that it doesn't seem very Pulitzer-ish. I'm also wanting to read Johnson's WELCOME TO BRAGGSVILLE.
@BRAKiasaurus @Marybethking I'm on 'Fates and Furies' right now. It's pretty good, but not knocking it out of the park for me yet. 'The Incarnations' was incredible.
@Marybethking I can't wait to read "The Incarnations"! I don't' believe it is eligible for the pulitzer, but it looks incredible. :) Based almost exclusively on the reviews, reception, and the current trends--and honestly, having read none of these yet...it looks like "Fates and Furies", "Have You Ever Had a Family" and "A Little Life" are the most likely contenders, in so far as novels are concerned.
A lot of great short story collections this year, so I could see one of them being included in the roundup. But I expect to see at least one of those three books being a finalist.
I also disliked A Little Life. I'm not sure I can voice why without risking misinterpretation, I just felt like some relationships and characters struck me as too unrealistic to draw me in.
This is my first time posting (I tried a few times by using Facebook account but they just say pending), but I've been lurking for months. I appreciate everyone's comments and have picked up great books based on recommendations on here. I even join the Odyssey First Edition book club after someone recommended it on here last Spring.
I do have to say I miss Ed Parks. I consider myself quite progressive on social issues, and I don't know exactly what he said, but I will say that A Little Life is hard to criticize without misinterpretation. Regardless I'm happy you all are still here.
And I just got my copy of "Have you ever had a Family" but haven't cracked it open yet so I'm no help there. I am excited for it though.
Did someone on this forum once present a theory (or even an analysis) on the boost New York-themed books (or New York-based authors) seem to get in the Pulitzer, NBA, NBCC, etc. awards? I was thinking about this in light of the acclaim A Little Life is getting. If someone actually looked at data, was this boost borne out? It wouldn't be surprising. On the other hand, AtLwCS, penned by an Idaho-based writer, was set in the past in Europe. So go figure.
@JohnZ @grahammyers We may have discussed this, but how did you feel it stacked up to Preparation for the Next Life? I haven't yet read AtLWCS.
As it has been with Biography (among other categories), it has also been with Fiction. Adam Johnson won a few years ago for The Orphan Master's Son, and rightly; it is a staggeringly good novel worthy of recognition.
In truth, though, I wouldn't have minded if Joyce Carol Oates had won for Lovely, Dark, Deep.
@grahammyers Great to hear! It is rare to read a novel as good as Lish's, and I completely agree that it should have won the pulitzer.
I'm not sure how I feel about the American Theme emphasis...while you are correct that this is one of the stipulations, it feels anachronistic to me. At the very least, one could argue that it could be applied in a more expansive way given the global nature of our interactions now.
the more i've been thinking about it, i really don't think 'All the Light We Cannot See' deserved the 2015 Pulitzer. it was a fine novel and had some beautiful prose, but it really lacked the 'American themes' vibe that the Pulitzer should award; would have given it to Atticus Lish
So far, this collection of linked stories is (like his debut novel) getting very good reviews. If he continues to create such beautiful books--each of which has featured uniquely beautiful and evocative writing--I will be shocked if Marra doesn't at some point win every major award.
@BRAKiasaurus @kriscoffield Hello one and all, this is my first post although I've had the pleasure of reading all of your opinions and fantastic suggestions for the past couple of years.
This seems to sum up how I felt about this book: a novel of great promise that it can't quite live up to.
I've been reading A Little Life, and while it hasn't been an awful experience, neither has it been very enlivening. The prose, I am finding, registers as little more than functional. Pervading Yanagihara's voice is a thread of detachment which, thus far, has not served the characters well. Now, perhaps this will change (I do have that hope); however, should it prove not to be true, I cannot say that I expect to experience much in the way of shock.
Some writers compose in a manner that erects a barrier between characters and readers; they present the story as though one were peering through a panel of aquarium glass. This is something I understand; and while I do not prefer it, I have enjoyed (though not loved or revered) novels that are written in such a way.
Anyway, the manner in which the characters in A Little Life have thus far been treated by the author brings back to me the indifference -- sometimes merely chilly; other times, glacial -- which I have observed Egan and Franzen utilizing in their own work. Perhaps Yanagihara felt it was necessary to do this given the exorbitant amount of pain and misery she inflicted upon her characters. Or it could also be the way she chooses to write.
Whichever the reason may be, I'm going to do my best to remain optimistic. That said, there are other novels that have been published this year which are better and more worthy of recognition.
@BRAKiasaurus @grahammyers Only three stories in so far, but I've enjoyed them. Not a lot has happned though yet.
@grahammyers I could see Joy Williams faring very well in any award season. I'm surprised it hasn't already been up--but I'm similarly surprised that David Gates collection hasn't received any notice. How are you enjoying it? I haven't yet read it, even though I was gifted an ARC from goodreads.
@ey814 As someone who lives in Northern California, the drought is interesting to me--using it as the premise for a novel could be great! I might pick it up. There are a few signed copies around.
@BRAKiasaurus Washington Post gave it a good review... I'm with you on dystopian novels, I've sort of had my fill of them...
@BRAKiasaurus @kriscoffield Yep. It was me. I am not usually a satire fan. I rather a "quiet" gut punch of a novel than a belly laugh, honestly, but Paul Beatty put together something really good, and it is a gut punch in the way it confronts racial issues.
@BRAKiasaurus I read THE TURNER HOUSE. It actually had some of the "fearlessness" that I love about some first novels, but it didn't quite gel for me. Still, I am glad it is getting attention. There was enough there for me to believe that Flournoy could produce something even better down the line. My assessment is to pass but watch for her next book.
@BRAKiasaurus And I could've had it. Went back to City Lights before leaving the city, today, but picked up BLACK EARTH instead. For what it's worth, BLACK EARTH–my plane reading back to Hawai'i–will likely be a nonfiction contender for multiple awards. Snyder's reevaluation of the Holocaust in parallel with modern resource depletion is striking.
I, too, am a reader of acknowledgment sections. It's interesting to see how many writers hail from the Iowa Writers' Workshop, or were Michener fellows, etc. I also know how challenging writing can be, so it's always refreshing to see writers who mention those who helped them in getting the book written.
I cannot say I prefer Schteyngart's method. In order to recommend so thoroughly as to write a blurb about it, it's important that one reads the book. If he or she does not, then said blurbs are, to me, suspect. Perhaps others have a greater reverence when it comes to reading and recommending than Gary does.
@kriscoffield Just a heads up, if you scroll down quite a bit, you'll find that jfieds2 read the book.
Anyway, just thought you might want to know. Pretty enthusiastic praise! :)
All of which is to say: it had nothing to do with blurbs. I was similarly happy to see Ed's endorsement of it--he hadn't really seemed terribly thrilled with any of this year's crop of longer fiction, so it his reaction was heartening.
I can't decide how I feel about Gary Schteyngart's method. It's almost like an act of performance art...and is moderately amusing. On the other hand, you could also make the argument that he is perpetuating a problem, not exposing it. Ah well...
I'll tell you this: having met Atticus Lish--a man who was unaware of who Jonathan Franzen was--he is one person whose opinion I will trust. I'm not sure you could buy an insincere quote from him if you tried. (I wish I knew who among this group has read his novel, actually. I think mrbenchly had. Ed started it, but the size of the font was off-putting, as I recall, so I think he put it down.)
When it comes to artists with whose work I'm unfamiliar -- this is when I consider what others artists have written regarding blurbs. But for the blurbs to pique my interest or influence me in any way, they have to come from artists whom I trust.
For example, when I watch a movie trailer, I look for the names of those critics and filmmakers whose work I admire. There are some critics who, it has been revealed, offer positive reviews in exchange for receiving perks. These critics I ignore, for I understand their endorsements are not based purely on the film itself.
Even on this forum, there have been books I've sought out because of endorsements made by other members whose opinions I trust. While he and I did not always see eye-to-eye regarding literature -- what each of us likes, after all, is influenced by aesthetic preferences -- my interest was also piqued when Ed Parks wrote so highly about Did You Ever Have a Family, which played a part in my seeking out the novel during a trip I made to my local bookstore. And, as I've said, the blurbs offered by Mr. Cunningham and Ms. Enright cinched the deal.
I think we've had this conversation before, haha:
By the way, your revelations about Toni Morrison's "Paradise" we're lovely. :)
Mrbenchly seems weary of Ed's "bemoaning" (and I must admit that I perceived a shift in his general tone after this past year's award toward something a little more antagonistic...it didn't bother me. Kept the forum interesting and active, but I did notice it).
Benchly thanked me recently for steering the conversation back to this year's books, a comment of which I think Ed may have taken note: when ey814 posted an article about prolific writers, Ed prefaced his response with a comment about inviting the ire of those who think this thread shouldn't deviate from speculating about the year's contenders. It is possible that the two (again, one of whom is still here, making me a little tentative to speak for him) were somewhat wary of each other.
I'm going to continue to post away here every day, and I hope Ed decides to return.
On a lighter note, I was going to read Groff's book next, but I may go ahead and dive into Clegg's novel and then Yanagihara's. Both have stirred up some controversy--on and off our site--and I better get to them quickly!!
@BRAKiasaurus @JohnZ @kriscoffield BRAK, thank you for your response. However, saying Ed was not charged with being homophobic is not true. It DID happen (albeit in a veiled manner). Still, that doesn't expunge the intention of the charge.
Understand, if Ed had spoken of certain aspects to be found in Mr. Clegg's novel (viz., gay characters) in a derogatory manner, I wouldn't have had a problem with mrbenchly's post. But as Ed did not do that, and, in fact, said the novel was the best of the year, I found the charge insulting. Also: untrue.
Ed and I did not always agree when it came to books; however, who does? That said, I enjoyed our civil discourse. As a writer myself, I understand the importance of considering views that are sometimes dissimilar to my own -- provided, of course, that people are civil about it and are able to back up what they think with facts. By sharing ideas, by listening as well as offering what we think, makes for enlivening and educational exchanges.
I was excited to post on this forum how much I am enjoying Did You Ever Have a Family, and came home from work with the intention of writing that post and telling Ed that he and I are of a like mind where Mr. Clegg's beautiful novel is concerned.
I saw this in the "Briefly Noted" section of the New Yorker. Piqued my interest. Anyone read it? Considering reading it?
If you do pick it up, it'd be great to hear your thoughts!
@JohnZ @kriscoffield By the way, this:
"It's important to be discerning before charging another human being as being homophobic, racist, bigoted, etc. And that's exactly what some on this board have done as regards Ed. "
(Just as an example: this year alone he has brought many, many short story collections to my attention. "Sweet Nothing" by Richard Lange is only on my radar because of EdParks.)
His actual point, I think, was actually just a matter of preference; the language he used to explain the preference, unfortunate.
JohnZ, I understand your reaction here. The internet overreacts to everything.** On the other hand, EdParks overreacted as well. Perhaps he didn't realize that deleting his account would result in the visibly dramatic deletion of all his past comments, and perhaps he will return...Hell! for all I know, he could be the owner of a couple of the accounts that are active on this forum: EdParks may well in fact be the pprize.com's very own Andy Kaufman!
Even if EdParks never returns to us, let us hope that Tony Clifton surfaces in his place. And in the future, let's hope that this forum continues to be a place for speculation and civil debate.
**I don't necessarily agree with you that the "condemnation" was over the top or lacked civility. Mrbenchly simply pointed out what appeared to be a pattern and cited examples. MrBenchly then went on to say that, for him, this pattern undermined EdPark's other literary opinions and lamentations.
To be clear, I am also an ally for those whom society attempts to marginalize and condemn. As for the "bystander effect" to which you referred, I do not support it. Nor should views that propagate stereotypes remain "unchecked" (viz., ignored). What I've observed is that those who do not call out such views do so not out of "civility," but rather out of fear and temerity.
It's important to be discerning before charging another human being as being homophobic, racist, bigoted, etc. And that's exactly what some on this board have done as regards Ed.
To explain why it won't do, I offer some points that will, I think, offer something in the way of amelioration:
It's too easy to judge others. In fact, it's a more commonplace practice now than it used to be -- a sad truth. However, before people starting throwing stones, they should do their best to understand whether or not their charges have veracity. For words can wound. This is especially so when those words are not entirely accurate.
Understand, my intention is not to be rude. But as you stated in your post, it's wrong to adopt a "bystander view" when you observe actions made by others that may be harmful and divisive.
But the divisions that have been made and continue to be perpetuated -- both in art and the world -- are disheartening. So many borders and restrictions are erected that attempt to pigeonhole and narrow minds that I cannot sometimes help but feel disheartened. There's enough enmity in the world already; one wonders why there are people who wish only to cause more. No doubt it has something to do with fear, willful ignorance, and control.
In order to read, be moved, and informed by Ms. Morrison's work, I do not need to be of a specific type; neither sex nor pigmentation need apply. All I have to be is human, discerning, and capable of empathy. This is what the best art reminds us of again and again.
If I'm not incorrect, Ed's primary problem with A Little Life was that it veered so relentlessly into melodrama. Then, after hearing about the author's intentions regarding the novel (viz., utilizing the elements found in melodrama was an intentional choice), Ed revised his views.
Which is all to say, we do not always have to agree. Provided one does not reduce him- or herself to being offensive or pandering to propaganda and hate, and also provided that he or she offers thoughts and ideas that are well-rounded, it is possible to be in conflict without usurping civility.
Hey everyone! Just curious to know people's take on THE SELLOUT. Saw it at City Lights, almost picked it up. Didn't, opting for some theoretical works to inform my scholarly projects. Worth reading?
I haven't heard much about Jesse Ball's "A Cure for Suicide"...maybe it will fall off the shortlist? Curious if anyone has read it. Same goes for "The Turner House".
(As an aside, I actually don't like the segmentation of literature into race, religion, sexual orientation, gender identity, etc. It is all literature--and when fiction is good, it is important, it is beautiful, and it teaches us about own humanity.)
It appears that EdParks has deleted all of his comments on the forum. Strikes me as an overreaction--and a particularly unfortunate one, given that this could instead have been an opportunity to have a more in depth dialogue about the subject.
A curious development--unexpected drama in our little corner of the internet--but I am glad that you, mrbenchly, spoke up. I hadn't yet decided quite how to respond.
@EdParks You'll forgive me if I ignore all of your future comments, but after such archaic statements ("I don't particularly enjoy reading gay fiction"; "It would have been a much better novel if Jude had been a woman"; "I just want her to choose her subject matter more judiciously in the future."), I simply don't care what you think.
For sinking to this level, I apologize to my fellow bibliophiles whose opinions I value immensely, and specifically to Tom. I'm just tired of the monopolization of this forum by the constant bemoaning of someone who has now revealed he thinks a novel about the social and emotional lives of gay men is not a judicious choice. Such telling commentary.
And based on what I have heard about "Purity", I think you are probably correct.
"Fortune Sniles" has been very well-received, but my bet is on "Fates and Furies". Johnson always writes--arguably even in OMS--with a sense of humor and a satirical edge. His first novel was received as basically full of brilliance and energy, but ultimately deemed uneven and often unsuccessful. He takes a lot of risks.
I thought you had come around on "Little Life"? I haven't read it yet, but I remember being surprised to see you even conceding that, we're it to win the Pulitzer, you wouldn't be unhappy with the outcome.
So far, you primarily hoping the award goes to a short story collection?
@EdParks Really glad to hear you enjoyed it!
@BRAKiasaurus i didn't think it particularly special. His whole multi perspective approach has gotten old there are so many problematic thematic problems that it really loses steam. Franzen is a wonderful writer and there are elements that are just a joy to read, but he too often comes off as too smart (or believing he is smarter than he is) and at times that is grating.
I forgot about Zink's and Pearlman's books. Seen "Refund" at the store--even picked it up to review the cover--but it's up against strong contenders. "The Turner House" was not on my radar at all. It is a debut and, just based on its competition, an unlikely winner.
@BRAKiasaurus @EdParks Agree that Fates and Furies seems to be coming on strong. Also give Above the Waterfall a good chance. I think it would be a surprise if Watchman made the list, but one never knows. Books that are published in 2015 are eligible, even if they've not been released yet, so Marra and McCann might show up....
@EdParks @ey814 Must agree with Ed completely. I assume long list is 10? If I had to guess all 10 (admittedly, without having read all of the following), I'd say:
A Hand Reached Down to Guide Me
There's Something I Want You to Do
But there may well be a surprise or two in there. Agree with Ed that "Our Souls at Night" might get a nod, but I would be shocked by "Watchman".
I'm not sure what the rules mandate in this case, either. I assume books that remain as yet unpublished (but which are due to be published this fall) could be eligible? If so, there is a chance that Charles Bock, Garth Risk Hallberg, Anthony Marra, McCann etc., could all find their way into that list.
Okay, National Book Award long list comes out tomorrow. Any predictions? I think we'll see A Little Life, Purity, and Did you Ever Have a Family. What else?
I always enjoy your comments, and I have been lurking for almost a year now. I just want to say I 100% agree with your review of A Little Life, and for me the author's comments were intriguing, but it definitely doesn't fix the novel for me.
I was a bit surprised you didn't love Preparation for the Next Life. I am curious if you are a fan of the author Wally Lamb, if you don't mind me asking.
@EdParks There's so little history of the man booker accepting novels from american writers that it's impossible to know if it will have some impact (positive or negative) on american awards (which tend to be diverse themselve).
So many contradictory opinions about A little life really have me intrigued (at least with so much recognition the probabilities of being published here in Spain increase).
I am 1/2 through THE SUNKEN CATHEDRAL. Although endings can sometimes make me change my entire opinion on a book, so far, I'd have to say, it's the best thing I've read this year. More soon.
I happen to have an ARC of THAT as well! (Gotten lucky on them recently)--a friend is reading it, and then I'm going to. I am very excited as well!
@ey814 I will send you my ARC when I'm finished with it if you'd like. I haven't gotten to it yet, so it may be a month before I'm finished. Let me know if you're interested.
@EdParks @ey814 I really enjoyed her novel that was a finalist for the pulitzer. Strange mix of magical realism and...hm...I don't quite know, honestly. I do recall it having a ghost.
In the meantime, I have an ARC of her new collection, and short stories are what she is most famous for.
As for Smith and King, I go with Mr. King, as well. He deserves more credit for his intelligence, skill, and talent than most people give him. It's nice to see he's finally being celebrated. Anyone in doubt of his writing and storytelling abilities would do well to read (among others) Lisey's Story, The Man in the Black Suit, The Reach, The Dead Zone, and Bag of Bones.
@EdParks (my long, well-written reply didn't post for some reason, so this one may be less well written :-)
Yes, I was thinking of Jeff Bridges as I typed Terms of Endearment, meaning Last Picture Show. I shouldn't rely on my memory! I agree with you completely about Duane, and would love to see a sequel to Picture Show. I lived in Dallas for 20 years and made several trips up to Archer City to see the town and, of course, go to McMurtry's bookstore.
Speaking of which, Joy Williams has a new short story collection out today.
@BRAKiasaurus I guess I would be remiss if we didn't at least throw "Purity" onto this list.
Did anyone else read Charles Bock's debut? I'm curious--given that it has been, what, seven, eight years since his debut--what his second attempt will yield. I think EdParks remained unimpressed with "Beautiful Children", but I haven't heard anyone else's opinions.
It is one of those signed books that has traveled with me through my moves around the country as I followed my career (only to wind up on the west coast in a very literary area), but I only read the first couple chapters. Impressively written, those. But I need to revisit it and read it in its entirety.
I have an ARC of "the visiting privilege"--stay tuned!
Also, I was more excited about Watkins' book before I learned it was a dystopian novel. Oh well, good writer nevertheless.
@jfieds2 Very cool! Will this be the book that gets him the Pulitzer he almost certainly deserves? I'm looking forward to reading it!
@EdParks @BRAKiasaurus @JohnZ Again, it's a matter of aesthetics, I think. Given your list of authors, it appears you prefer older works. Which is fine. I enjoy them, too. Anyone who denies him- or herself the pleasure of disappearing into Tolstoy, Melville, Dostoevsky, Fauklner, etc. -- well, that's just unfortunate. Quite sad, too.
So many of the Pulitzer winners in the early part of the last century dealt, on some level or other, with pioneer life. And while my intention isn't to disparage those novels (which offered me much pleasure and insight to a time during which I had not been born to observe and experience) none of them comes close to Lonesome Dove. Mr. Stegner's Angle of Repose comes close, but Lonesome Dove was just too pleasant an experience to knock it down a peg.
@EdParks @JohnZ @BRAKiasaurus One of the added joys of reading that I've discovered is going back to books I haven't read in decades, visiting them again, and discovering how my feelings might (or might not) have changed.
When reading a book, even though the words are the same (aside from translations of Tolstoy, Dostoevsky, and the like), everyone "sees" the story through the filter or his or her singular imagination. In addition, we bring our own life experiences and opinions to art. As we grow (one hopes), we change (one hopes), so that going back to something we read long ago becomes a somewhat new -- maybe even heightened -- experience.
As for "getting too old" -- phsaw! As long as we're willing to surrender and have an open mind, we continue to be works-in-progress.
To date, when asked about the funniest novels I've read, A Confederacy of Dunces and Straight Man (Richard Russo) head the list. Should The Feud continue to unfurl as it has thus far, I'm thinking I've another novel to add to my list.
Because of this, I am again re-examing my ambivalence regarding works of art being placed into contention. Great work is great work, after all: it should be recognized as such. Then again, we're a species that enjoys its approbation.
I'll keep my fingers crossed. I like the premise of the book.
@mrbenchly @BRAKiasaurus Agree! I think we have hit a lull, and it has caused more reflection on old titles and, for lack of a better term, regrets. We are thankfully heading into the fall, however, when the heavy hitters tend to be released. And then it's on into the awards season! So far--to unnecessarily summarize--it seems like the favorites (or promising titles) I've heard mentioned are:
If I'm missing anything, feel free to add on.
I'm passing on "Purity" for now but if a used copy shows up somewhere, I'll consider it. The NPR review of the book by Roxane Gay (which is titled "A Compelling Plot Gives Way to Farce in Franzen's 'Purity'") put me in mind of exactly what puts me off of his work. "But, for every wonderful piece of prose, for every masterful stroke in this novel, there is the stuff that was simply distracting, if not alienating and infuriating. For all its extravagant ambition, the book is full of self-indulgent nonsense."
Having just read a 930 page book that was both compelling and yet completely uneven, I think I'll pass for now.
"The Incarnations", which will not be eligible for the Pulitzer, sounds incredibly promising. Looking forward to that one. :)
@BRAKiasaurus I have not but I do appreciate you steering the conversation in this 2016 Prediction page back toward one about books published this year. This comment thread has, for the last 8 years, been my radar for potential prize-winners I should read and I appreciate all the tips I can get.
@EdParks @BRAKiasaurus @JohnZ Perhaps, but I doubt our standards are that different. I'm surprised you would disagree about "Beloved" or "A Death in the Family", Updike's work or "Ironweed". Even if you didn't appreciate them all, certainly there must be at least a handful in JohnZ's list that you believe to be among the best fiction our country has produced?
@EdParks @BRAKiasaurus @JohnZ Confederacy of Dunces: Let some time pass, then go back and read it again. It's something special.
@BRAKiasaurus @EdParks @JohnZ What you observed about Rabbit, Run, can, I think, be found in all of the Rabbit books. Each encapsulated a decade -- one during which Mr. Updike kept a notebook and wrote down interesting news stories and details concerning pop culture. It's a series ripe for a time capsule, as there seems to be in it just about everything that reveals what it was like to live in all of the decades the novels considered.
I enjoyed All the Light We Cannot See. Is it the best Pulitzer novel in recent memory? No. But it wasn't a horrible novel.
@BRAKiasaurus @JohnZ @EdParks The Moor's Account is one of the books I've been reading, and it is very good. It's on the Booker long list, too. Lovely prose and imagery.
I'm in agreement concerning Beloved. Considering novels that have been published in the latter part of the century, I think it's the one that will sustain interest, admiration, and dialogue one hundred, two hundred, etc., years from now. The characters, the theme, the structure, the quality of the writing -- an exceptional novel on all counts.
We both know how each of us feels about Lee's book, so we'll leave it at that (ha ha).
I have The Feud and have started to read it. Ah, Berger. Such wit.
@EdParks @JohnZ (Meanwhile, I notice I wrote "cannon" instead of "canon". Now's as good a time as any to say that I share your lament about the inability to edit comments, EdParks.)
@EdParks @BRAKiasaurus @JohnZ Yes, the first three you mentioned are absolutely great novels and belong in our cannon.
As to AtLWCS, I haven't read it yet. Still working my way through the crop of this year's books. (For example, I think the next book I will read--as I just finished "City on Fire" and am wrapping three short story collections--will be "The Incarnations" and then, probably, "Saint Maize".)
We won't ever agree on everything. I don't understand why "The Road" won, and we have already argued over my disbelief that Lee Martin's novel would have been a finalist. "Love in Infant Monkeys" was a similarly bizarre choice. "All Souls" has some beautiful writing, but a Pulitzer finalist? I hated "Mean Spirit" when I read it--it has been awhile, so it's possible that I would enjoy it now.
I have All That Is, yet I haven't read it yet. The title has been surfacing in my mind, which is a good indicator that I may soon be reading it.
I would gladly have given the pulitzer to Ben Lerner's 10:04, and I think Stone's "Dog Soldiers" (a finalist, I think, although I don't recall what it was up against) should have won.
I'm interested if anyone has personal choices of his or her own that should have won the Pulitzer. Maybe I'm a glutton for punishment (ha ha), but I always find it a good thing to learn of books that others consider great, books that resonated with them. My library is already extensive (you've no idea!), but I believe in the adage "One can never have enough books."
So if anyone has specific books or collections that were in contention for the Pulitzer that he or she thinks should have won, please share them.
For entirely different reasons, I was reminded of James Wood's review of "& Sons" wherein he said something along the lines of "Gilbert can't seem to decide what kind of writer he wants to be" and then basically said that the book, while written by a writer of immense talent and potential, didn't live up to its promise, suffered from the writer's own indecision.
Underworld is a mess of a book, but it is brilliant and every page and word works towards its theme. I see why some might have cut parts of it, but I wouldn't have cut anything.
I don't know that I would necessarily cut anything from "City on Fire" either. Rather, I would simply have done what Harper Lee's editor did early on: told him where the potential was and ask for a rewrite.
@EdParks @BRAKiasaurus Much like The Goldfinch, this book is large, hard to put down, and incredibly uneven.
In fact, the best parts actually take place in the characters' past. Mercer, an african american gay man who is living with the estranged heir to the Hamilton-Sweeney corporation, goes home to the south to see his family. He re-connects with his deviant brother and comes out to him. The moment feels sincere, is very well done, and exposes Hallberg as a writer to be watched--if the entire book were that strong throughout, it would certainly deserve to be in the running.
@EdParks @BRAKiasaurus @ey814 @grahammyers I would hope that Smiley read the entire novel if she was willing to review it. Her thoroughness notwithstanding, I have read other reviews, each of them heaping praise on this book.
I don't think size will actually affect its potential. It is largely dialogue, and the year The Goldfinch won, it was up with "The Son" and "The Woman Who Lost Her Soul". Three huge novels. My guess is that Vollmann's novel would be put up against two 400-500 page novels, so the page number would likely be similar to 2013.
In any case, I'm not so cynical that I think serious people charged with the simple task of reading 3 books and then voting would shirk such a pleasant responsibility.
@ey814 @EdParks @grahammyers This one is of interest to me and should probably be in the running for this year's prize. His work is often lauded--including the uneven tomes, the best parts of which evidence a potential that (in so far as I can tell from reading reviews) makes the worst parts ever-more disappointing. So to see a book so universally praised this time around....I think there may be something worth keeping an eye on here.
There have been some particularly strong contenders this year that deal with race, particularly on the subject of being black in America. I think we are likely to see at least one of those get a nomination--and if journalists (inexplicably) help pick the winner, the social relevance could well award it the prize. Thinking in particular of "The Sellout" (which I haven't read) and "Braggsville" (which I have).
@ey814 @EdParks @grahammyers Will do my best later this year. :)
@EdParks @grahammyers The Dying Grass was reviewed by Jane Smiley in the NY Times (http://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/02/books/review/the-dying-grass-by-william-t-vollmann.html). I'm too am interested in how well its received, I admire the scope and intent. Given my turtle-pace of reading, though, I'm probably not going to read it, so will rely on someone on this list to fill me in!
@EdParks I remember a discussion about David Rhodes when Driftless came out. He is an Iowa Writers' Workshop graduate and had published a number of well regarded novels in the 1970s, one drawing favorable comparison to Sherwood Anderson's "Winesburg, Ohio." Driftless was the first novel he'd published in 30 years, after the accident. Several discussants on the discussion board liked the novel, and I bought a first edition, but didn't end up reading it. I may have to go back to it.
@EdParks I saw this as well. You wonder why someone of Matthiessen's status didn't donate his library/ephemera to a library somewhere, I'm sure there would have been many takers.
I like the cover, and the scope of the book (and its subject matter) is intriguing--sounds like a real deviation from his previous two endeavors. I won't have time to read it until later this year, but I will be keeping an eye on the reviews (including the one we'll likely receive from you, EdParks) to try to decide whether it's a question of "when" instead of "if".
His short story collection is also due out in a couple months!
@BRAKiasaurus I just picked this up and look forward to reading it. I'm sure it will be uncomfortable in some ways but his is a voice that needs to be heard.
Despite the fact that we tend to focus on fiction here, I wanted to quickly give a nod to Ta Nehisi Coates' "Between the World and Me". Essentially an epistolary essay, it is a devastating account of what it means to be black in America. It vacillates between personal anecdotes and broader treatises about racism in America. For example:
It is powerful, and while it may provide few answers, everyone will come away with a deeper perspective and a new way of asking questions.
I am actually more curious about one of Scout's next publications (out next Spring): "Tuesday Nights in 1980", but I will save that for next year's discussion.
@BRAKiasaurus A smaller trim size would certainly be the first strategy to "bulk" up a short book.
@grahammyers @EdParks I changed my mind and picked it up. He's somewhat local, so I'm going to get him to sign a few books including his new one. Will not read it until later this year; but will let you know when I actually dive in. Honestly, it has gotten the most universally positive reviews of any book--possibly outside of "The Sellout" and "Braggsville"--that I've seen this year.
@EdParks the obscure topics he chooses to write about and the sheer volume of his works puts him out of contention for me. i'm sure he's an excellent writer, but i can't justify reading his books.
@EdParks I too have been keeping an eye on this book...very curious how this book does in the awards season--universally positive (and starred) ratings, from what I've seen. He's an interesting writer! I think I'll probably dive into Europe Central before I buy this tome, however.
@EdParks I got mine from B&N yesterday. It is BIG. Not sure when I'll be ready to read it. David Truer (I think) gave it a great review.
That said, the font size: I prefer a smaller font size, but I also recognize (as someone who wears glasses) that I won't always enjoy that luxury. Interestingly, Anne Enright's novel has really large font. I'm not sure why particularly, although I wonder at times if they do that simply to make short novels seem more substantial? Enright's book received solid reviews, as I recall.
@AlexKerner I'm very curious about A little life, people seem to love or hate that novel. Bill Clegg's first novel is nominated too, Portrait of an addict as a young men is published in Spain (i remember some papers interviewing him a year and a half before it was published here, i remember thinking who is this guy to get such attention from the media)
I'll definitely have to pick up a copy. Hopefully I can find a signed first.
@ChrisEllis77 @BRAKiasaurus BLACK RIVER has stuck with me. It is not perfect, by any means -- it has some problems indicative of first novels -- but besides THE SELLOUT, I haven't read anything else yet that I think has a chance of winning.
I read Mr Tall by Tony Earley a few days ago, some short stories and a novella, very well written, he seems to write a lot around marriage at different stages. maybe he has plentyy of experience there.
Agree with you about the Pulitzer winner this year...it would be nice if the award would go to any deserving novel, particularly an under-recognized or independently published book (as I believe it should have last year with "Preparation for the Next Life".)
I have also read The Shore ,Alex, yes I agree its very good, maybe a chance. The last years I have just waited to last in the year to see who the genral public have been siding and gone for that, from a collectors point of view, it would be nice if something won which did not have a 100,000 in the first print run.
@AlexKerner Haven't read it yet, but the description sounds interesting
@EdParks @ey814 This is really sad news. I didn't realize his age until recently, when listening to an interview about Andrew's Brain.
@EdParks I'm a big Joe Coomer fan. The Loop is one of my all time favorite books. Also really liked The Decatur Road. Sorry to hear he's having difficulty finding a publisher.
@BRAKiasaurus @Marybethking sure if you can or I can just wait until October!!
In any case, I'm not sure where to obtain a copy offhand, but I am happy to report back about the book. If I happen upon another copy, would you like me to send it your way?
@EdParks I really did enjoy the 'The Bright Forever' as well. I think I did if I'm remembering my reading correctly!
@BRAKiasaurus how or where do you get an advanced copy? thanks!!
Has anyone ever gone backward and read Pulitzer Fiction (Novel) from the beginning and evaluated why they won, or wondered why? I do follow this blog and it always becomes exciting as it reaches the yearly end. Thank you.
@EdParks @BRAKiasaurus continues to get better...not striking me as a pulitzer book yet, though.
@BRAKiasaurus I finished it last month and thought it was fine. If you're going to read over 900 pages I think you want to like it a little more than just okay. I liked A Little Life infinitely more.
I just finished Infinite Home and loved it. It's scope is pretty small, but the writing is spectacular. I'd love for it to get some attention.
Fates and Furies was also really good. I think it could make some waves as well.
I have copies of Purity, Gold Fame Citrus, and Eileen, all of which I have very high hopes for.
So far, "city on fire" doesn't even remotely strike me as Pulitzer material. It is compelling and hard to put down, but it reminds me vaguely of Donna Tartt meets Richard Price. We will see as I continue--definitely worth picking up to read at this point, but hasn't yet--150 pages in--convinced me that it is worthy of that particular award.
@EdParks i think it is safe to assume that it will not win the Pulitzer
@EdParks @BRAKiasaurus @JohnZ She can be, though she often makes very good and fair points about books. I wonder what James Wood is going to say about the novel...such a unique situation, this.
Hmm....Corrigan definitely confirms some of my concerns about this novel. Will have to read it myself to decide if I agree or disagree.
@EdParks @BRAKiasaurus Ha, I am 30, so I guess relatively young. It is true that my literary eyes are bigger than my stomach, but I usually get to most of the things that are truly important to me.
I have about 10 books going right now, one novel, one non-fiction, 6 or 7 short story collections, and a book or two of poetry, and I tend to read different things in different settings. The train: poetry or short stories, the gym: nonfiction (not sure why), and novels in the evenings and weekends.
But I guess we'll see. You may well be right. I of course will never get to everything, but that indisputable fact does little to quell my voracious appetite. :)
I've been meaning to read The Tunnel--I believe that's often considered his best work?
@EdParks @JohnZ It is true: I have no reason to assume she continued to write. Except that Lee was a writer, and as such, I would be absolutely shocked if she resisted the temptation to continue her craft long after her debut publication albeit in secret.
It was not, as I understand it, the writing she disliked but rather the limelight and (perhaps) the likelihood that no followup would ever live up to "Mockingbird".
Still, readers cannot help but to feel they have a personal stake, and when a writer does something readers with which readers are not comfortable (if not outright angry), it hurts.
The bottom line, I suppose, is that authors can do whatever they want with their creations, and sometimes they take their characters and change them to a degree that knocks the polish off them.
I am not interested in attacking or defending the book prior to its publication (as I said above, I'm far more interested in the editing process and if this will ultimately lead to other works being released). I do agree that it might be timely, if for no other reason than it may have us all reopening "Mockingbird".
While I don't think the racial divide is growing, I think that the internet has illuminated an issue that was always present but previously easier for some to ignore. This novel is perhaps just one more, thankfully non-violent, opportunity for us all to consider the country's legacy and the ways in which those issues persist today.
Even after reading and liking the first chapter of Go Set a Watchman, I have to admit Ms. Kakutani's review has given me pause. I think she, too, was a little stunned by how a character in the novel has been treated. Or is it rendered? For Ms. Kakutani, it seemed rather a timorous review.
Which is all to say, in the coming days, one suspects quite a dialogue is going to be had. And given the current socio-political climate in this nation, perhaps Go Set a Watchman might well provide something in the way of a catalyst. I suppose there's something to be said for synchronicity.
The controversy is moderately interesting to me: from one perspective, she might not have published the novel if this were 20 years ago and her mental faculty was indisputably undiminished. There is a chance that she was, in fact, taken advantage of by the publisher and lawyer; on the other hand, authors who pass away often have their work published and so this may have surfaced, no matter her wishes, after Lee's death regardless.
In that vein, this novel may well be the first in a series of post-humous publications by Lee. I would be shocked if she didn't work on another novel, a set of short stories, etc. Again, we'll see.
@EdParks @BRAKiasaurus @ey814 Ha, I don't actually think our tastes and interpretations are that divergent. The tempestuous tone of our recent dialogues aside, I tend to enjoy the novels your recommend. (You strike me as someone who puts great effort, as needed, into the novels you read--even going so far as vouching for the allegedly overwritten portions of "The Stones of Summer", suggesting that they are in fact part of the voice of a drug-addled mind--which is why I was honestly surprised by the assertion that Walbert's footnotes were gimmicky or that you wanted a straightforward narrative.)
But I think we tend to agree on most things...and just as a reminder: I am not (yet) an advocate for last year's pulitzer winner. I doubt I will hate it; I also doubt I will read a better book from last year than "Preparation for the Next Life". That would have been my choice, and I'm holding fast to it.
In any case, I liked what I read of Bock's novel--but I had to put it down (I don't recall why)--but it was certainly the "City on Fire" of its year. My friend at McSweeneys was dismayed, as they had released something the same week, and Bock's book sucked all the air out of the room.
Franzen's novel seems to be getting pretty mixed reviews, and (again, a way in which our tastes diverged, I did not care for his last novel).
Very curious about "The New Valley"--going to try to read it at some point in the next few months, I think, when I finish the CoF ARC. His novel did sound strikingly different, so I was curious. Thanks for the opinion!
@EdParks @ey814 I love when they put this stuff out...although there are less exciting things coming out this fall than I would have expected. That said, these lists tend not to be entirely thorough. I'm finishing up "The Sixth Extinction" right now (and I can't recommend it highly enough).
I will start "City on Fire" next--I have received an ARC of it. Will let you know what I think, but I'm very excited to read it.
Colum McCann's book is exciting, as is Marra's--actually Marra's is more exciting to me than McCann's. Not sure if I care about Johnson's collection, but I will likely pick it up as he is local and will inevitably have at least one signing here in the bay area.
I am also interested in Vollmann's book, however I haven't read many of his works, so there's no reason I have to start with this. Will likely pick read "Europe Central" before I read "Grass". Claire Watkins' novel certainly piqued my interest, but David Mitchell's work sounds minor.
They didn't include Kathleen Alcott's "Infinite Home"--which has received a bit of buzz--though perhaps that was on the previous list?
Not even remotely curious about Harper Lee's novel, a book that likely shouldn't have been published but which will likely be of more use to scholars than to anyone else.
@EdParks @BRAKiasaurus Eh, I don't know. Will let you know what I think--I'm perfectly comfortable being challenged by an atypical structure.
@EdParks @BRAKiasaurus I don't even remotely require a story to be straightforward in its telling. I also do not feel footnotes to be a gimmick simply because they are rarely used (although many wonderful authors have used them: Wallace, Diaz, etc.). I went to see Walbert speak and she talked about how important it was to her that these be there as interjections, as asides for the reader, things to interrupt the linear train of thought. I think in this case she was crafting an experience--an experience which may be undermined on a device, something she struggled against.
@EdParks Keeping an eye out for Alvar's book...I like to buy locally to support my local bookstores, but for some reason most haven't stocked it. It sounded like one of those books that could fly under the radar and then win lots of awards.
I reached out to a friend who has a City on Fire ARC. I'll let you know what I think when I've received / read it.
@BRAKiasaurus I don't receive ARCs ever (maybe because since I returned to goodreads I haven't written any reviews, not that I wrote many before), but since you mentioned goodreads, feel free to friend me: https://www.goodreads.com/AutumnalFrost I left because I spent too much time on there and had to many "friends" with little or no similar interests. I'd be interested to see what other books my fellow Pulitzer enthusiasts read.
Hey all, I don't know that the moderators want to turn this into a marketplace at all--however, I occasionally find (and buy) or receive ARCs from goodreads, etc. If anyone ever has ARCs or books they're looking for / want to trade, etc., I'd be interested.
It occurred to me, because I recently received a copy of "Everybody Rise" by Stephanie Clifford in the mail from goodreads, and I (like the rest of the world) am looking for an ARC of "City on Fire" without spending too much (since I will buy it when it comes out anyway).
Anyway, just throwing it out there. :)
@EdParks @BRAKiasaurus I started the book--it is loose and impressionistic and very well-written. I will see her speak this Thursday, and am very curious how this book which seems playful with structure and form compares to her other work. I have KYOTO and SHORT HISTORY OF WOMEN.
@EdParks @ey814 I am truly saddened by this news, and yet, he lived a long life. I wish "All That Is" had received more much-deserved accolades, because I think he deserves to be recognized by the wider public. I would certainly have been happy if it had--even in a year so full of strong novels--won the Pulitzer.
@EdParks I agree... and am glad! So, did you come to a decision about how many of the Pulitzer winners are, in your estimation, great? I think it's a good question.
@jfieds2 @ey814 I don't know....Kirkus completely contradicts the PW review. I think some people may just be disinclined toward larger novels. In any case, there is certainly a lot of hype around this book, and it is hard to live up to that.
That said, I still think (having read only the excerpts) it is likely the best Pulitzer contender I've heard about this year.
PW is just one publication, but I'd be surprised if any Pulitzer winner had something like that in a review...
Has anyone read or heard about "The Wonder Garden", a collection of short stories which received a star review from Kirkus?
@EdParks @BRAKiasaurus And I would like to note that it is a HUGE pet peeve of mine when people who don't finish a book feel entitled to critique it (and therefore dissuade others from reading it). Drives me nuts. It is a rare thing to be presented with quotes, admittedly out of context, in those same reviews...and that is the only reason I lent them any credence whatsoever. But I'm sure I'll get to it sometime.
"Paris, He Said" by Christine Sneed (I haven't read her novels, but her short stories were solid, very promising, and garnered a bit of attention.) This novel got a good review on The Millions. It is out already.
"Fates and Furies" by Lauren Groff. She got a bit of attention a few years back on this forum for "Arcadia". Releases on Sept. 15. Might be worth keeping an eye on.
That said, even had I read Doerr's much-praised ATLWCS, I hardly think it hypocrisy to enjoy one novel and then, in a world of so many indisputably high-quality books, be put off by the writing quality of (and therefore choose not to read) another. If I do read the novel at some point, I am quite confident that I will be capable of understanding. That doesn't mean my opinion of his writing will change.
@EdParks @BRAKiasaurus Yeah, not sure--I can't judge too much without reading it for myself...reviewers on Amazon seem to be creating long lists--most distinct from each other--of sentences they hated. I must say that I agree with their choices...the writing is just poor in most cases, often due to nothing more than the prolixity of the sentences.
But perhaps there are reason for it. I may get to it one day, but even if I do, I will likely remain wary...
@EdParks @BRAKiasaurus Yeah, like I said, the film was really awesome! And it's pretty cool that he got the book reissued on the power of the film alone--additionally, the book seems to have been well-reviewed at the time, simply a victim of circumstance.
That said, these writing samples (found in the one-star reviews on amazon) really put me off:
But it's possible the book--despite whatever benefit it may have found from some strong editing--is lovely in its totality. I just haven't ever given it a go.
@EdParks @BRAKiasaurus I really enjoyed that film--the film is fun and really inspiring for book lovers like ourselves. Hoewver, when I looked into the book itself, I was utterly put off by the excerpts in the 1 star comments on amazon....the writing was atrocious.
@EdParks @Marybethking Just got both in the mail. Keep ya posted!
@EdParks @BRAKiasaurus Yeah, I don't share your opinion of "Freedom" at all, but sometimes that has more to do with timing. I think there are books which, were I to revisit them, i would experience them completely differently.
@EdParks @BRAKiasaurus I don't quite recall what piqued my interest in Hale's novel. I will say that I find Iowa Writers' graduates to have a good track record--though perhaps I have lucked out.
I may disagree with your assessment of A Little Life, but we'll see...I feel like I heard some comparison to Franzen at some point, and although "The Corrections" was a fine novel, his followup was disappointing...which is to say: if the comparison stands, I may well find myself in the same camp as you. I read the first few pages and nothing about the writing struck me as the effort of "a major novelist", though the writing wasn't bad. Simply found it uninspiring.
I would say some of the most powerful work I have read over the past decade would be classified as "gay literature"--though I myself see no real reason to give it a label (I find a lot of sub-categorization somewhat troubling, particularly when it goes beyond genre to include theme, race, or creed); "By Nightfall" and "You Are Not a Stranger Here" are two books that come to mind. But I digress...regardless, I'm curious about "A Little Life" and will let you know what I think.
Glad to hear you like Knausguard's work. Looking forward to committing myself to it this year. (A few big books I plan to read this year: the evolution of bruno littlemore, a little life, city on fire...going to try to fit book one of karl ove's opus in, as well....next year, gonna give "Infinite Jest" a go, I think.)
@EdParks @BRAKiasaurus This is the tweet to which I referred:
In Santa Monica, with @AtticusLish, who's taping Bookworm with Michael Silverblatt. The novel will also be a selection of @kcrw's book club.
I'm honestly not sure I would read Knausgaard's work out of order, myself. The opening of Book 1 is very impressive. It describes the way the body shuts down in death. It is the passage that convinced me to pick up the rest of the books.
Lish's book is strong--the writing is just wonderful. At the reading I attended, he was asked about his sentence construction. He responded that he was more concerned with the structure of paragraphs. Where they begin, where they end, how one thought moves into the next. Definitely curious to hear what you think.
@EdParks @Marybethking They release today--will pick them up and let you know my thoughts. I have Robin Black's novel from last year queued up first and am working my way through The Last Flight of Poxyl West, which hasn't captivated my attention...
@EdParks @BRAKiasaurus By the way, I read that Atticus Lish had recorded an interview for Bookworm; it hasn't aired yet, so I can't verify, but I think I saw that on Tyrant Books' twitter feed.
@EdParks @Marybethking @BRAKiasaurus Yep, they're releasing super soon.
@BRAKiasaurus do you have any idea as to when these are to be released? I couldn't find either when I searched my library database online.
@EdParks Interesting. I loved Drop City. Haven't been bowled over by much of anything else, and just didn't finish The Women. But, your endorsement convinces me.
By the way, not eligible, but "The Black Snow" by Paul Lynch has gotten some wonderful reviews for its incredible writing. Seems like a book that shouldn't be missed!
I'm looking forward to two forthcoming books:
@EdParks I've never read Boyle's longer work (I've read some of his short fiction in Mcsweeneys), but he seems to garner a lot of praise. Worth picking this novel up, I gather?
@EdParks Can you elaborate on what you liked about Richard Lange's book? Sounds like he's known for his short stories--but I gather his novels tend to be more genre oriented? Master of capturing different voices?
Do you think it is a pulitzer contender? His previous collection seemed very well-received.
@ey814 Aw, glad to hear it, Ed. I am simply under the impression, however mistaken, that you and I have similar tastes. It is possible to be a voracious reader who consumes books of all sorts (although I, like ey814, am not a fast reader) but who is consistently drawn to particular types of plots or writing. I'll pick "Local Wonders" and "Sweet Nothing" and let you know what I think!
@ChrisEllis77 I'd also like to thank the lot of you. I came for the predictions, and stayed for the chatter.
@ChrisEllis77 Welcome Chris! I'll be interested to hear from the folks on this list about the quality of the writing in this book (versus To Kill a Mockingbird). I wonder how many Advance Reading Copies will be released, if any. Until someone sees the book, seems to me it's all an open question!
So far from this list, I've read 'A Little Life', 'The Harder They Come' and 'Delicious Foods'. 'Delicious Foods' has had the biggest impact on me so far. I would also add 'The Sympathizer' by Viet Thanh Nguyen.
@tklein27 If you hear anything about signed editions, let us know!
Hello all, I have been followng this site for a few years now, and would like to congratulate you on how interesting and useful it is, for both reading and collecting.
Has anyone any ideas or views on it.
@BRAKiasaurus @AlexKerner there are several books this year that are getting lots of praise. It's going to be a good reading year.
But who knows! It might be great. I will be endlessly curious, however, to see how it fares against the expectations and during awards season!
I'll list off the big books that are worth noting and probably paying attention to:
Well I guess I'll kick things off. Can't wait to read Go Set a Watchman. The cover looks similar to the Mockingbird cover. I imagine there will be a ton of first printings. But there might also be some special signed and numbered editions issued as well.
I read somewhere that Reese Witherspoon will be the reader for the audio version.

Neuro science helps us to look at how the brain operates. The more we know about the brain, the better we can understand how people make decisions and SOMETIMES Why.
We begin our journey with a visual representation of the brain. <br><br>"On assignment for Psychology class, Jackson Mohsenin set out to create an infographic that displayed &amp; explained the major sections of the brain and their functions. The brain is extremely complex, and thus the goal was to communicate just enough without overloading the viewer with information."
While today we have many cool and relatively high-tech tools to study the inner workings of the brain, such was not always the case. For many thousands of years looking inside of a functioning brain was very near impossible.
So study of the brain was focused on the rare cases of brain injury (imagine a person got hit in the head and subsequent behavior changed), the effect of certain "drugs" on thought, and postmortem dissections.
On the shoulders of giants (Thanks Isaac Newton!)
That does not mean the brain was not studied, only that it was more difficult and less precise than brain study today. There are many (trust me I have spent hours reading them for fun) online timelines that give a historical perspective to how far we have come. Two of my favorite historical examinations are:
A timeline from Eric Chudler of the University of Washington that goes back thousands of years. The level of detail for any given "event" is low, but very interesting and a great starting point.
The History of the Brain from PBS covers the same material (that's good right!?) but has a bit more description and pictures.
Today we have many ways to study how the brain works. At the risk of oversimplification there are five main ways of doing this:
EEG-- Electroencephalography (EEG) measures electronic impulses within the brain. This is done by having the person being studied wear a series of sensors on the scalp (often done with a "skull cap") Pictures here. The benefit of this is that it is MUCH cheaper and relatively fast.
Blood tests--these measure levels of various neurotransmitters in the blood. The most important of these include Oxytocin, Serotonin, and Dopamine.
The next few tools "Slides" will cover these in more detail.
A research team from Arizona State University has been engaged in a unique research project. Academics have studied leadership for decades. But leadership remains an area of relative mystery because so much of it is associated with cognitive and emotional response. A new multidisciplinary approach is called leadership neuroscience.
VERY little finance per se, but so interesting I had to include it: "A Canadian man who was believed to have been in a vegetative state for more than a decade, has been able to tell scientists that he is not in any pain. It's the first time an uncommunicative, severely brain-injured patient has been able to give answers clinically relevant to their care."
Good or bad, we may soon be able to Read Your Mind
Neuroscience has learned much about the brain's activity and its link to certain thoughts. As Lesley Stahl reports, it may now be possible, on a basic level, to read a person's mind.
When two people are trying to make a deal -- whether they're competing or cooperating -- what's really going on inside their brains? Behavioral economist Colin Camerer shows research that reveals just how little we're able to predict what others are thinking.
While there is some evidence linking violence in general to risk factors such as age, sex, substance abuse, and personality traits such as anger and impulsiveness, over many years, researchers have established that only a very small subset of people suffering from mental illness are likely to commit violent acts.
Listening to music may make the daily commute tolerable, but streaming a story through the headphones can make it disappear. You were home; now you're at your desk: What happened? Storytelling happened, and now scientists have mapped the experience of listening to podcasts, specifically " The Moth Radio Hour," using a scanner to track brain activity.
New technologies are shedding light on biology's greatest unsolved mystery: how the brain really works.

Tomorrow is September 1st, already. How did that happen? Fall is right around the corner, and I know this because the Halloween decorations have already started to hit the shelves and retailers are coming out with pumpkin spice everything (I'm serious; yesterday I saw pumpkin spice almonds in the nut section of the Hellmouth. Bleh!).
I love the fall, so, this is not exactly bad news for me. But, the summer went by so fast! I feel like I blinked and I missed it, and, if my less-than-stellar performance on my bucket list is any indication, I just may have. So, let's get to that list:
2. Spend as much quality time as possible with the Cub before we deliver him to college. I did pretty well at this one. The Cub worked a full time job, played baseball, and kept up an active social life, but I still made every effort to spend time with him.
4. Re-create the black and white picture that I took of the kids with Jana's crew back in 2008. Oh, my heart, did I ever accomplish this one.
5. Lake time. Yeah...never saw a drop of water this summer. The boat being in dry-dock for the majority of the summer was a major buzz-kill; I'm still irritated by it.
6. Enjoy my 30th high school reunion. Success! I had a great time, and, while I initially said that I didn't have a part in planning it, I did end up hosting that Bloody Mary/Mimosa bar with my old friend, which, actually ended up making the reunion even more fun.
7. Do a deep cleaning of my house, including the closets and attics. Again, give me just a second, ha! ha! ha! ha! Yeah. No.
8. Decide what the hell I'm going to do as an empty-nester. This, my friends, is going to be a work in progress. Please stay tuned.
10. Cherries. Homemade mint chip ice cream. Fresh vegetables from the farmer's market. Well, I ate my body weight in cherries, and, I made a batch of mint chip. I never made it to the farmer's market, but, two out of three ain't bad.
11. Spend some time with The Girls. I am so sad that this particular item didn't get done. But! We have made plans to get together the third weekend in September, and, as I said at the beginning of this post, September starts tomorrow! So, the countdown to Girl Time will commence shortly.
Also commencing shortly: my 2017 Fall Bucket List. How much do you want to bet there is an item about healthy eating and exercise?
Ha! I am nothing if not predictable.
- I'm still watching this show. This is quite possibly a record for me.
- Matt's beard is threatening to take over his face. This situation is threatening his status as the prettiest scenery in the house. Trim that shit down, Matt!
- Matt: "I don't throw my girl under the bus". Hmmm, wonder how long that will last.
- I don't think I've ever been as creeped out by a human being as I am by Kevin. Again; shudder
- I am beginning to think that Josh lacks an indoor voice.
- Kevin's dismay at the trashed house almost makes me feel sorry for him. Except, he's totally creepy, so, yeah...not so much.
- Seriously, Matt, baby, trim that facial hair.
- And that's it for the showmances this season.
- Man, I hope they send Raven home tomorrow, there won't be anything pretty in the house if Matt is evicted.
Yesterday, my nephew- long known on this blog as the Rebel Without a Pause- welcomed his first child into the world.
Yes, he and his wife are grown adults, theoretically, but, in my mind he'll always be my four-year-old sidekick, learning how to howl at the moon and begging me to read The Rainbow Fish just one more time (for the twentieth time).
Time, man. It's a sneaky bitch.
Today was the Cub's first day of classes, and, he sent me this picture to mark the occasssion.
I was impressed that he went to all the trouble of posing for a picture, let alone making a sign.Then, he confessed that his sister had actually made the sign for him; slipping it into his suitcase while my back was turned the night that we took him to her house to say goodbye.
If they asked for ponies for Christmas, I just might be tempted to buy them each one.
Ok, it's not exactly a hobby, but, I have decided to do something that challenges me as often as possible. And, I started today, with a high mountain hike with Kristi, one of my favorite co-workers.
The waterfalls on the way up were a nice scenic bonus, and, with Kristi as my hiking partner, there was never a moment when I felt judged for my obvious physical limitations.
As a side note, I am really, really out of shape. It's time to address that, especially if I am going to continue to challenge myself in any way, shape, or form that is physical.
Looks like we can expect a return of the Exercise Induced Tourettes any time now.
If we have learned anything in our trips to Hawaii, it's that they are going to take several long days of travel to accomplish. This trip was no different; we left Queen B's house at a little before 9:00 p.m. (following the last family dinner that we will all eat together), and drove through the night to reach the Salt Lake City airport, where we parked the car, reclined the seats, and grabbed two hours of restless sleep before boarding our first plane at 7:20.
The first flight, ironically, delivered us to Denver, where we boarded the second flight, bound for Hawaii. Please don't get me started on the fact that we couldn't find a cheap flight directly from Denver, which still would have resulted in a five hour drive, but, would have saved us the lay-over. I don't understand the economics of air travel, obviously.
Anyway, the flight from Denver to Honolulu took seven hours, at which point we arrived on the island with plenty of time to gather our luggage and rental car, check into our room, and hit Waikiki Beach for a leisurely stroll before dinner at The Cheesecake Factory, where we indulged in the namesake dessert x three.
After dinner, we headed back to the motel for a night of rest before the real festivities began the following morning. And, by festivities, I mean the minutia involved in getting the Man-Cub checked into-and moved into-his dorm room.
Our first stop was the local Bed, Bath & Beyond, where we picked up the Cub's Pack and Hold order, consisting of his bedding, towels, desk lamp, a few microwave accessories, and bathroom organization items (as an aside, this is a really great program; our day would have been a lot more stressful if we hadn't had the option to pick everything out ahead and to have it waiting when we arrived. It saved us quite a bit of time).
Once we had our items, we headed for the Hawaii Loa campus, where check-in was accomplished in less than two minutes, the Cub's official school ID was procured, and our load was transported to the dorm via golf-cart. It really was that simple.
Dinner that night was Godon Biersch, which I mentioned in yesterday's post, and then we dropped the Cub off for his first night as a resident of the dorms.
Wednesday morning, we were up early to attend the convocation ceremony at a theater in downtown Honolulu. It was a grand event, and, one that we wouldn't have wanted to miss. Then, we made the decision to skip the day's orientation sessions, because we had already done everything on the agenda when we visited in June.
Instead, we spent the day driving the North Shore, stopping for pie at Ted's and exploring the Waimea Valley Falls Park area, which, was awesome. It was there that we got to see an ancient Hawaiian dwelling as well as examples of Hawaiian flora that was truly breathtaking. It was an interesting stop and I'm glad we didn't miss it.
On the drive back to Honolulu, we saw a seal, sunning herself on the beach (I know she was a she because she was being watched over by a seal preservation volunteer, who was more than happy to give me some of the details about monk seals and their endangered species designation).
We watched the seal until she made her way back into the water and then we hit the road, again.
Dinner that night was with Cindy, Ken, and their daughter, Madi, who was a doll and with whom the Cub connected, immediately (they made plans to head for the North Shore to jump from the cliffs that we visited back in June). We visited until well past sunset, at which point Hugh and I excused ourselves due to our early flight.

I would be sad about being so easily replaced, but, let's be honest; I'm happy if he's happy. And, Hawaii makes my son very happy.
I just wish it wasn't so freaking far away.
Our trip back took sixteen hours, including a short layover in San Fransisco and the five hour drive from Salt Lake City. I guess it wouldn't be paradise is it was easy to get to.
We got back from Hawaii at 1:00 this morning, after which I crashed for many, many hours, finally waking at 11:30, which, is unheard of for me. In my defense, it was only 7:30 in Hawaii, and, my sleep pattern must still be there, along with my son.
Sooo, now I am adjusting to a new sleep pattern and an empty nest. This shouldn't be uncomfortable at all.
1. The Man-Cub's college campuses and his dorm room are definitely going to be favorites-for the Man-Cub, at least.
Yeah, no need to worry about the two of them doing anything crazy. No need at all.
Anhoodle, they really lucked out with a room that sits on the corner of the building, meaning that they have a private bathroom, despite us having paid for a room with a bathroom shared between four people.
The boys did get a bonus roommate the first night...but we don't think he's cut out for the college life.
3. Exploring the Cub's new home has rapidly become a favorite past time for myself and Hugh. We utilized our rental car to the maximum this trip, and, I'll write an actual post about that, but, it's safe to say that having the freedom to cruise the island was a favorite (which goes a long way in explaining the Cub's excitement at his roommate having a car).
We saw some amazing scenery, dipped our toes in the ocean on two new beaches, explored a botanical garden, hiked to a waterfall, and saw some gorgeous flowers and wildlife, including a seal!
4. I can't lie, I'm already missing my boy, but, knowing that the Cub is happy, fitting in, and excited about his future is the most favorite thing of all, this trip.
This is one of his first Proof of Life selfies (remember, I require Proof of Life, twice a day)...
...he's already killin' it in Hawaii.
It's all Fun and Games Until Someone Pulls a Hammy...

In honor of this coming weekend's Auburn and Georgia game here are a couple new-ish prints that I've done. I obviously did the Auburn one 1st but felt like I should do one for our neighbors to the north. If there is another team you'd like to see (that isn't Alabama) then please send me an email. Thanks and WAR EAGLE!
I will be participating in a Halloween show at My Parents' Basement on Sunday 10/25. I will be there with a bunch of great local artists showing off our stuff. Hope you can make it!
And here is the map of the event:
I will be at the Grant Park Summer Shade Festival this coming weekend (August 29 & 30). The festival will be going from 10a-10p on Saturday and 11a-7:30p on Sunday. I always have a blast and look forward to another great time. I will be in Booth #8 which is across the way from where I've been the last few years (#45ish). I have a ton of new stuff I can't wait to show off. I hope you make it out!
Saturday 5/4 is Free Comic Book Day. I am very happy to be a guest of Odin's Comics for the day. I will have some prints/artwork with me and will be sitting with some amazing local artists. We'll be there from 11am to 6pm.
Some of the great folks that will be there include the following:
Bobby Nash - Award-winning writer of novels, comic books, short prose, and screenplays.
Stan the Zombie - Issue #2 available at the event.
The Belligerent Monkey - Creator of low-brow and pop art pieces (that's me!).
I wanted to say thanks to everyone at the Diesel Fueling Station. I ended my residency there today and brought all my stuff home. They were amazing to work with and I hope we can do something together again in the future.
This one isn't exactly new. I finished it a little while back but haven't posted it here. Here's a Dr Who and Dr Dre mashup. Currently availble as a print on canvas and a magnet. If you're interested please send me an email.
Huge thanks to everyone that made it out to the show at the Diesel Fueling Station this past Friday night. The folks at Diesel were fantastic and I had a blast. The paintings will be there for about a month before switching out to a different artist. If you saw something you liked but didn't get a chance to grab it please send me an email. THANKS!
I will have my 1st solo art show of 2015 this coming Friday (2/6) at the Diesel Fueling Station in Virginia Highlands. It will start at 7pm and will have music provided by DJ Rev Andy.
I'll have paintings on the walls and I will be set up with prints and magnets. Hope you can make it. Should be a blast! The paintings will stay up for about a month after the show.
Here's an Andy Warhol. take on Wonder Woman that I just finished. These are always fun to do and I've done a Princess Leia and Ron Swanson in the same style before.
I made this guy over the holiday break. All the equations in the background are actual calculus equations. This is my 5th robot and I think I have a few more left in me. You can see the others here: #1, #2, #3, and #4. I'll have prints and magnets of this one available soon. Shoot me an email if you're interested.

Moving to K-W can be confusing for anybody: how can you explain King Street, that runs north, south, east and west ?! Or streets like King and Weber, that are sometimes parallel, and yet cross each other in two places ? For someone new to the country, adjusting to life here can be even much more confusing.
The Centre focuses on two main areas in its work. First it tries to help immigrants with whatever they need in order to participate in their new life. Second, it helps community members to adjust to its changing face.
To help the community welcome those new to the area, the Centre provides seminars and workshops for community groups, businesses, and schools.
Just in case you are getting the impression that it’s all work and no fun, let me remind you of the Multicultural Festival, which is held every year at Victoria Park during the Canada Day (July 1) weekend. For two fun-filled days, the whole family can enjoy crafts, traditional dancing and especially foods from around the world ! This event is something Kitchener-Waterloo always looks forward to.

After sensors have been turned on Intermittent setting, it is not possible to change their setting in the future. Even if a player turns them either on or off, the Intermittent setting returns. Apparently, this is only problematic for multi-player games and does not present itself in solitaire games.
Any weapon that has a range less than 1.0 nm, cannot be fired by the AI. However, the player is able to utilize these weapons manually and they appear to operate at the correct range. I do not know if missions created by the player will suffer this restriction, but I suspect that they will since Missions are under AI control.
After victory has been awarded to a player in solitaire mode, if the player elects to continue, a Multi-Player Chat Window opens when he selects "Yes".
Units that turn off their radar can still show up as being jammed with the "X" next to their icon.
Unit is unable to plot a course that enables it to leave port and proceed to Formation patrol zone.
EmCon status of units does not match the EmCon state shown in Unit display and there is no way to turn it off..
Planes were added to a base and assigned to a mission. However, they disappear and access through the Mission editor is not possible.
Runways can be reduced, but not be destroyed by nuclear weapons.

Stevens was inside the Brooks House the day after a five-alarm fire in 2011 caused significant damage to the historic 1871 building, and he has been working almost three years to stabilize and rebuild it.
During a tour of the Brooks House Thursday he pointed out the painted Sheetrock walls which represent an important milestone in the $24 million rehabilitation project.
"When you see Sheetrock it means you're in the home stretch," he said. "We're in good shape. We are where we need to be and I am optimistic that it is all going to be done on time."
An electrical fire started in the Brooks House on April 17, 2011, damaging the historic Main Street building.
Water from the fire fighting teams caused further damage, and the building has been vacant ever since.
After working almost a full year to put together a financing package to rehabilitate the structure, Stevens and his four partners closed on the property in July 2013, and work crews have been on site ever since.
On Thursday the Brooks House Development Team led a group of supporters, business leaders and members of the media through the Brooks House.
But he said for the most part the work has been progressing, and on any given day up to 100 workers are on the site among the building's four stories.
The colleges are expected to bring about 350 students and another 50 staff members into downtown everyday that there are classes.
The scope of the massive project was evident during the tour, with 143-year-old brick walls and columns visible through steel joists and frame work that will support the new walls that are being installed.
Stevens said some of the apartments are still available, and not all of the retail spaces have been rented.
Still he said interest in the apartments and in the retail spaces continues to grow, and Stevens said he was not concerned with how empty spaces would affect the development team's ability to meet its financial obligations.
The team in investing up to $24 million in the re-development project, even though the property is expected to be assessed at about $8 million.
When all of the work is done the 80,000 square-feet in the Brooks House will have been completely renovated and refurbished.
"It's all new," Stevens said. "It's going to be an all-new building inside the old shell."
The restored lobby will lead to a two-story atrium.

I will also be available for tutorials by request.

HERE IS A SELECTION OF OUR RECENT PRESS CUTTINGS…

Looking for a few great books to share with the young ones this holiday? Here are a few favorites from my time as a teacher and school librarian {and now, as a mom.} A little activity follows each summary if you’d like something thematic that ties into the story. Happy reading!
This beautiful book with simple rhyming text shows animals getting ready because “someone” is coming to their house. On the last few pages you see it is Mary and Joseph. The woodblock illustrations and lyrical wording make it a quick but touching read. One of my favorites for sure, and the kids loves the animals. Describes the nativity in a simple but meaningful way for younger ones. A perfect starting point for talking about the story of Christmas. Read it before setting up your own nativity!
*note: I’m linking this to Amazon but have no idea what the price is so high.
Stop the presses! Polar Express is a good Christmas book! I know you know that already, but I couldn’t keep this classic off the list. It’s special no matter how many times you read it. Have a jingle bell ready to gift to the young one you are reading it with– bonus points for pretending you can’t hear when they jingle it!
Jan Brett has illustrations that will have you finding something new each time you look at them! While these aren’t specifically “Christmas” related, gingerbread is certainly a holiday tradition. Look for lots of wonderful surprises hidden in the illustrations in this favorite book! Gingerbread Baby also comes in a board book format. Now, go bake some gingerbread as a tie-in and you’ll have a friend forever.
Yes, this won’t win any awards but for the infant set it is perfect. Touch Santa’s beard, look in the shiny ornaments, and more! Noodle loves to repeat all the adjectives, so after we read we look for things around the house with those same qualities.
By special request of my husband I am including this. It was his favorite as a child, and when we looked it up a few years ago found that the only copies that existed were considered “vintage” and ran about $200. It’s been republished so *someone* might be getting it in his stocking this year! Sounds like another excuse to go bake some cookies… with sprinkles, of course.
I know, it’s not a Christmas book. However, the toy collection of the main character rivals that of a major department store– and in a season of abundance you’ll soon see it ties in perfectly with the theme of “less is more“. Read it before doing a toy room clean-out and donating unused toys– a perfect chore before Santa comes for a visit!
Every year, this tree gets passed over by families looking for the perfect tree. As he grows taller and taller his hopes fade that he’ll be that tree for someone special. His woodland friends show him the meaning of friendship as they help him realize his dream! Make paper trees for your mantel or table in honor of this noble tree. Or, go out and decorate a tree outside with items from nature. Forces you to get creative!
What are your favorite holiday books? Any that you must read each year? Please share!
These books sound great. I’m going to see if the library has some of them
Nothing’s better than a good book for children.
@drama queens mum: we were just at the library, scouting out more books! I bet they do have them… love the library!
These are great selections! I haven’t seen A Wish to Be a Christmas Tree. I am going to add that to the collection. One that I love is Auntie Claus by Elise Primavera. I used to read it to my 4th graders. They must have liked it…every copy got permanently borrowed. I hope you and your family have a very Merry Christmas!
I googled Christmas book list and look what popped up. I should’ve remembered you had a list. I think some of these will be added to our advent book list. Thanks for the recommendations.

Random musings on everything from music, sports, and just general stupidity, from a person that probably thinks too much...
You know why I love football season? Besides actually having something to do during the day on Sundays, there is always some great drama. And we all know that the best drama involves large sweaty men all angry from steroids. Its basically like a giant soap opera for guys that also involves hitting, jock straps, and an oblong ball... Wait, did I just say that?
"I'll go on record as saying that Terrell Owens vs. Pac Man Jones is the most emotionally unstable one-on-one matchup in NFL history. I'd have loved to hear their pre-game conversation:
Sounds about right to me... Where else do you get such emotional complexity besides a middle school or a telenovela?
I mean, what is there not to love? Football has everything one could ask for. And just wait until this Sunday. I hear that Philly fans have been working on a chant for T.O. that involves the letters O and D....
Does anyone else wonder how long it took them to come up with that? Do you think there was an Eagle Fan forum composed of 20 fat, sweaty men that spent hours locked in a poorly ventilated, underground room debating what would be the most effective way to get to T.O.'s psyche? Was it similar to the signing of the Declaration of Independence? I bet it was probably a little more intense... Hopefully the strain of remembering all the different letters doesn't get to them and they start chanting "T.D." whenever Owens has the ball... (Yea, yea... I know it's easy to pick on Eagles fans)
Either way...I sure do miss the cleverness of Philly fans (Who have the best "cheer" in football) now that I don't live there anymore...

When would you like to visit The Lodge at Lakeline Village?

For free version, install the latest version of the plugin from WordPress.org plugin repository.
For Premium, download the latest version from Relevanssi.com and either upload the zip file using the WordPress plugin installation or unzip it and upload the files with FTP in the /wp-content/plugins/ directory.
Relevanssi doesn’t come with a search widget. You can use the default WordPress search widget or any other method that generates a standards-compliant search form.
Enter your API key here to enable automatic updates and PDF indexing. API key can be found here on Relevanssi.com – it’s in the sidebar when you’re logged in.
If this option is enabled, Relevanssi will index author display names. Searching for an author will find all posts written by the author.
Enter an integer. Words shorter than this many characters are not indexed. The default value 3 is pretty good for English, for other languages other values may make sense.
By default Relevanssi removes some punctuation completely and replaces the rest with spaces. These fields give you control over the most common punctuation types: ampersands, hyphens, dashes, apostrophes and quotes. You can define the behaviour for all of these classes. The correct settings depend on what kind of content you want to search, but the default values make sense in most cases.
By default Relevanssi sends a link to the PDF to the reading service, which then downloads the PDF and reads it. However, if your files are behind a firewall, in an intranet or otherwise not accessible from the outside world, this is not going to work. In that case, check this option, and Relevanssi will upload the files directly.
If you have chosen AND as the default operator and the search finds no results, Relevanssi will perform an OR search with the same search terms. If you want to disable this, check this option.
The search term has to be either in the beginning or the end of the word, so searching for “ion” will find “caution” or “ionized”, but not “cautionary”.
If you want to emphasize something, don’t be afraid of using big numbers. If you want to make sure that posts with the search terms in titles come up in the search, slap a weight of 100 or 1000 for the titles. Subtlety is overrated.
If you’ve added extra weight for recent posts, this option determines which posts are considered recent.
If you check this option, custom post types which have exclude_from_search set to true will be excluded from the search. If the option is unchecked, Relevanssi won’t respect that setting and will search anything that is indexed.
On large sites searches can become heavy to process, particularly when there are common words involved. Relevanssi has to load every post that is found by any search term, and that can require lots of memory. In most cases, the user only cares about the few posts on the first page of search results.
If you want to restrict search to a particular category, you can do it here.
If you want to permanently exclude posts or pages from search, you can list their numeric IDs here. In Premium, you can also use a checkbox on the edit pages to exclude posts. That is easier to use and works in multisite searches, unlike this option.
If you enable logging, then you’ll find the searches logged and presented in Dashboard > User searches. Logs are necessary for the Did you mean function to work in the free version.
If you want to disable logging for particular users (like yourself), add a list of comma-separated numeric user IDs or login names here. “admin” is a good start, unless you’ve changed the main user login name.
The log database can get large. It is possible to automatically trim the logs. Enter a number here, and the logs older than that many days will be automatically removed.
Choose the length of the excerpt, either in words or in characters. Use words, it’s many times faster than using characters.
If you enable this option, Relevanssi highlights query terms in comment text, when you open the post from the search results page.
Most people need not uncheck this, but if you’re using for example Cyrillic alphabet and the highlighting doesn’t work properly, unchecking this option will help. By default the highlighting regexp is using word boundary markers, and those do not always work properly with non-ASCII characters.
If this is checked, Relevanssi will add extra information in the end of the search result excerpts.
Synonyms can be used to make search more powerful. If you have for example lots of abbreviations in your posts, but some posts use the non-abbreviated form, you can make those two synonyms for each other. Searching for one will find the other.
Stopwords are words that are not indexed. Large part of any text will consist of support words that are pointless for searching. Those meaningless words would still be the biggest part of the index, were they left in.

Hi, What can I do if my theme has no search functionality? http://themeforest.net/item/heal-responsive-medical-wordpress-theme/3127829?sso?WT.ac=search_item&WT.seg_1=search_item&WT.z_author=raybreaker
So, with your theme, we just use the default search widget? Or…do we add it somewhere? This could be made more clear in the documentation for us n00b users. You went in depth on everything else – but this.
Yes, just use the default search widget. It is not mentioned, because in most cases, you really have to do nothing – just use the search widget your theme already has, and most themes do have one.
It’s still incredibly confusing. Most plugins come with their own widget, so not mentioning it at all, anywhere, is not really helping 🙂
Hi Mikko, I just tried to install the free version but am not seeing any changes in the search widget. I have a premium theme from Solostream (Wp-Mysterious) and also I have checked the “Use Search for Admin” box. What do I need to do to get this to work?
The search result page stays the same.
However I can’t seem to get synonyms to work. I’m trying to get searches for prioritization to show results including prioritisation so entered:
I don’t know of such synonym library.
What do you mean “nothing happened”? Does your blog load the search page at all?
Looks like the search works on that site.
Did you use the search box in the header and it works?
Yeah, the search box worked just as expected, and the results seemed sensible: http://truliluli.ro/?s=sherlock
Hmmm, but do not work like here http://www.mindtheproduct.com or here http://www.filmsforaction.org/ for example … And i dont understand why
I can’t seem to get synonyms to work either. I’ve entered
But I still get 0 results if I search on “obits,” even though “obituaries” gets pages and pages of results.
OH I get it now. Yes, I was using AND search. In your previous answers I wasn’t realizing you meant as a total setting, not an individual query. Sorry about that! And thanks.
Hi Mikko. My client would like the search results to show the relevancy score,YET have the results displayed by DATE. I have selected this option in the settings: Default order for results: POST DATE. But it is still displaying by RELEVANCE. Any thoughts? can you help?
No idea, changing the setting should change the order immediately. Displaying the relevancy score should have nothing to do with that.
Bad_Self, read this post: http://www.relevanssi.com/knowledge-base/words-ampersands-cant-found/
I am trying to exclude some pages with “Exclude these posts/pages from search:”. But it doesn’t work. Pages continue appearing on searches. These pages would be “635, 298, 639, 379, 294, 668, 1782, 147, 2920, 2874”. Some solution?
Are you running the latest version of Relevanssi? Are you sure that your search results are coming from Relevanssi?
Versión 3.3.5. I am not sure at all, but I think It’s running via Relevanssi. Our web is tavad.com. Can u check?
I can’t even get to a search results page from the search.
Ok, now I’m seeing a search results page. Looks like Relevanssi, yes. As for the exclusion not working – I’m not sure. There shouldn’t be any reason for it not to work; I just tested it on my test blog, and the feature works just fine.
I haven’t got any posts of myself on it yet, just some demo posts. So you can try searching for ’email’ or ‘mobile’ to see how the results look like.
Hi! Is there any documentation on how to do this?
i would like to disable indexing of post excerpts. Is it possible?
It’s an option you need to enable in Relevanssi settings in the first place.
I did, but post excerpts are still indexed and this is a problem for me. Can you think of anything that went wrong?
Thanks, will fix this in the next version.
Thanks for the update, Mikko. I am now able to add stopwords like “aren’t” but still can’t remove the old ones, same error. Any suggestions? Perhaps manually remove them from the DB?
Yeah, manual is probably the best.
Installed relevanssi and can’t get the synonyms to work either. I have the default operator on “OR” so I can’t figure out what I’m doing wrong.
What are the extra steps? I’m using Forever Wood – is that a problem?
But the easiest thing is to just disable Relevanssi and see if the results change. Do that first.
Are those form entries posts in the WP database? If not, the answer is no.
No they aren’t posts – I’m new to this – so should I put the spreadsheet in a post somehow and just not show that post?
Explain what you’re trying to do, what should be found in searches and what not, and what is the exact nature of your problem. I don’t quite understand what is your problem now.
Looks like this is some bug in Relevanssi. I’ll have to investigate. I’ll try to fix this for the next version of Relevanssi.
Hey! I’m not sure if you fixed this yet. I have the same problem when searching for pages in the actual pages section. Relevanssi turned on for admin simply returns 0 results.
Yes, this was fixed. Are you using the latest version of Relevanssi?
Is there a way to prioritize pages over blog posts with the premium account?
If the Chinese text is in UTF-8, Relevanssi can read it and index it. However, Relevanssi simply does not work with Chinese or Japanese: these languages do not separate words in a way Relevanssi understands. Thus, even if you could index the contents, they wouldn’t make any sense. So unfortunately you have to forget about using Relevanssi with Chinese or Japanese.
Thank you for your excellent work and plugin.
Max, that is not a Relevanssi feature. It’s coming from your theme. You need to edit your theme search results template to fix the issue.
1. What is the latest version of PHP you are supporting?
Stephen, since you’re a Premium customer, go to the support page and send me a support request there, with more details of the problem. What exactly is the problem with the shortcode?
Ville, no, this is the first complaint I’ve heard. What kind of settings you have, and how big is your database? 502 usually means the search is too heavy for the server.
I’m happy debug a bit more in order to find out the real issue but at least I can enable the plugin again.
Happy to say that Relevanssi has nothing to do with this, this was a problem with the theme.
Omer, CDN should have no effect on this; caching may, I suppose. No idea how that would actually have an effect.
I was searching for its widget, when I guessed it could work with the existing search widget.
I was just wondering if it’s possible to make Relevanssi show results only when the beginning of the word matches the search term?

are just an extension of natural breeding, and have no risks different from naturally bred crops.
However, a large and growing body of scientifc research and on-the-ground experience indicate that GMOs fail to live

energy-efficient and safe ways of meeting current and future global food needs.
documenting the limitations and risks of GM crops and the many safer, more effective alternatives available today.
Because of this, any health effects from a GM food would have to meet unusual conditions before they would be noticed. The health effects would have to:
• occur immediately after eating a food that was known to be GM (in spite of its not being labeled). This kind of response is called acute toxicity.
• cause symptoms that are completely different from common diseases. If GM foods caused a rise in common or slow-onset diseases like allergies or cancer, nobody would know what caused the rise.
• be dramatic and obvious to the naked eye. Nobody examines a person’s body tissues with a microscope for harm after they eat a GM food. But just this type of examination is needed to give early warning of problems such as pre-cancerous changes.
To detect important but more subtle effects on health, or effects that take time to appear (chronic effects), long-term controlled studies on larger populations are required.
Under current conditions, moderate or slow-onset health effects of GM foods could take decades to become known, just as it took decades for the damaging effects of trans-fats (another type of artificial food) to be recognized. ‘Slow poison’ effects from trans-fats have caused millions of premature deaths across the world6 .
Another reason why any harmful effects of GM foods will be slow to surface and less obvious is because, even in the United States, which has the longest history of GM crop consumption, GM foods account for only a small part of the US diet (maize is less than 15% and soya bean products are less than 5%).
Nevertheless, there are signs that all is not well with the US food supply. A report by the US Centers for Disease Control shows that food-related illnesses increased 2- to 10-fold in the years between 1994 (just before GM food was commercialized) and 19997 . Is there a link with GM food? No one knows, because studies on humans have not been done.
Although studies on humans have not been done, scientists are reporting a growing number of studies that examine the effects of GM foods on laboratory animals. These studies, summarized below, raise serious concerns regarding the safety of GM foods for humans as well as animals.
• Mice fed GM insecticide-producing maize over four generations showed a buildup of abnormal structural changes in various organs (liver, spleen, pancreas), major changes in the pattern of gene function in the gut, reflecting disturbances in the chemistry of this organ system (e.g. in cholesterol production, protein production and breakdown), and, most significantly, reduced fertility19
The following problems have been found:
• GM DNA in feed is taken up by the animal’s organs. Small amounts of GM DNA appear in the milk and meat that people eat24 25 26. The effects on the health of the animals and the people who eat them have not been researched.
Do Animal Feeding Studies Highlight Potential Health Problems For People?
But GM crops that caused ill effects in experimental animals have been approved for commercialization in many countries. This suggests that less rigorous standards are being used to evaluate the safety of GM crops than for new medicines.
In fact, in at least one country – the United States – safety assessment of GMOs is voluntary and not required by law, although, to date, all GMOs have undergone voluntary review. In virtually all countries, safety assessment is not scientifically rigorous. For instance, the animal feeding studies that GM crop developers routinely conduct to demonstrate the safety of their products are too short in duration and use too few subjects to reliably detect important harmful effects.27
While industry conducts less than rigorous studies on its own GM products, 28 it has, in parallel, systematically and persistently interfered with the ability of independent scientists to conduct more rigorous and incisive independent research on GMOs. Comparative and basic agronomic studies on GMOs, assessments of safety and composition, and assessments of environmental impact have all been restricted and suppressed by the biotechnology industry.29 30
The industry and its allies also use a range of public relations strategies to discredit and/or muzzle scientists who do publish research that is critical of GM crops.33
• In the late 1980s, a food supplement produced using GM bacteria was toxic41, initially killing 37 Americans and making more than 5,000 others seriously ill.
GM companies focus on producing cash crops for animal feed and biofuels for affluent countries, not food for people.
GM crops contribute to the expansion of industrial agriculture and the decline of the small farmer around the world. This is a serious development as there is abundant evidence that small farms are more efficient than large ones, producing more crops per hectare of land48 49 50 51 52.
In the study, Dr Gurian-Sherman distinguishes between intrinsic yield (also called potential yield), defined as the highest yield which can be achieved under ideal conditions, with operational yield, the yield achieved under normal field conditions when the farmer factors in crop reductions due to pests, drought, or other environmental stresses.
The author concludes: “commercial GE crops have made no inroads so far into raising the intrinsic or potential yield of any crop. By contrast, traditional breeding has been spectacularly successful in this regard; it can be solely credited with the intrinsic yield increases in the United States and other parts of the world that characterized the agriculture of the twentieth century.”59
“If we are going to make headway in combating hunger due to overpopulation and climate change, we will need to increase crop yields,” says Dr Gurian-Sherman. “Traditional breeding outperforms genetic engineering hands down.”61
If GM cannot improve intrinsic (potential) yield even in the affluent United States, where high-input, irrigated, heavily subsidized farming is the norm, it would seem irresponsible to assume that it would improve yields in the developing world, where increased food production is most needed. Initiatives promoting GM crops for the developing world are experimental and appear to be founded on expectations that are not consistent with data obtained in the West.
In the West, crop failure is often underwritten by governments, which bail out farmers with compensation. Such support systems are rare in the developing world. There, farmers may literally bet their farms and their entire livelihoods on a crop. Failure can have severe consequences.
Industrial agriculture is a major contributor to global warming, producing up to 20 per cent of greenhouse gas emissions, and some methods of increasing yield can exacerbate this negative impact. For example, crops that achieve higher intrinsic yield often need more fossil fuel based nitrogen fertilizer, some of which is converted by soil microbes into nitrous oxide, a greenhouse gas nearly 300 times more potent than carbon dioxide. Minimizing global agriculture’s future climate impact will require investment in systems of agriculture less dependent on industrial fertilizers and agroecological methods of improving soil water-holding capacity and resilience.
GM seeds are created by agrochemical companies and are heavily dependent on costly external inputs such as synthetic fertilizer, herbicides, and pesticides. It would seem risky to promote such crops in the face of climate change.
According to some analysts, peak oil, when the maximum rate of global petroleum extraction is reached, has already arrived. This will have drastic effects on the type of agriculture we practice. GM crops are designed to be used with synthetic herbicides and fertilizers. But synthetic pesticides are made from oil and synthetic fertilizer from natural gas. Both these fossil fuels are running out fast, as are phosphates, a major ingredient of synthetic fertilizers.
Farming based on the current US GM and chemical model that depends on these fossil fuel-based inputs will become increasingly expensive and unsustainable. The statistics tell the story:
• Approximately 7.2 quads of fossil energy are consumed in the production of crops and livestock in the U.S. each year.74 75
• Approximately 8 million kcal/ha are required to produce an average corn crop and other similar crops.76
• Two-thirds of the energy used in crop production is for fertilizers and mechanization.77
Proven technologies that can reduce the amount of fossil energy used in farming include reducing fertilizer applications, selecting farm machinery appropriate for each task, managing soil for conservation, limiting irrigation, and organic farming techniques.78
Climate change brings sudden, extreme, and unpredictable changes in weather. If we are to survive, the crop base needs to be as flexible, resilient and diverse as possible. GM technology offers just the opposite – a narrowing of crop diversity and an inflexible technology that requires years and millions of dollars in investment for each new variety.
Each GM crop is tailor-made to fit a particular niche. With climate change, no one knows what kind of niches will exist and where. The best way to insure against the destructive effects of climate change is to plant a wide variety of highperforming crops that are genetically diverse.
GM companies have patented plant genes that they believe are involved in tolerance to drought, heat, flooding, and salinity – but have not succeeded in using these genes to produce a single new crop with these properties. This is because these functions are highly complex and involve many different genes working together in a precisely regulated way. It is beyond existing GM technology to engineer crops with these sophisticated, delicately regulated gene networks for improved tolerance traits.
Conventional natural cross-breeding, which works holistically, is much better adapted to achieving this aim, using the many varieties of virtually every common crop that tolerate drought, heat, flooding, and salinity.
In addition, advances in plant breeding have been made using marker-assisted selection (MAS), a largely uncontroversial branch of biotechnology that can speed up the natural breeding process by identifying important genes. MAS does not involve the risks and uncertainties of genetic engineering.
The controversies that exist around MAS relate to gene patenting issues. It is important for developing countries to consider the implications of patent ownership relating to such crops.
If it is accepted that niche speciality crops may be useful in helping adaptation to climate change, there are better ways of creating them than genetic engineering. Conventional breeding and marker-assisted selection have produced many advances in breeding speciality crops, though these have garnered only a fraction of the publicity given to often speculative claims of GM miracles.
Both claims require further analysis.
All of these chemicals are toxic and a threat to both the farmers who apply them and the people and livestock that eat the produce. This is the case even for Roundup, which has been shown to have a range of damaging cellular effects indicating toxicity at levels similar to those found on crops engineered to be resistant to the herbicide90.
In China and India, Bt cotton was initially effective in suppressing the boll weevil. But secondary pests, especially mirids and mealy bugs, that are highly resistant to Bt toxin, soon took its place. The farmers suffered massive crop losses and had to apply costly pesticides, wiping out their profit margins100 101 102 103. Such developments are likely to be more damaging to farmers in developing countries, who cannot afford expensive inputs.
In Argentina, the massive conversion of agriculture to GM soya production has had disastrous effects on rural social and economic structures. It has damaged food security and caused a range of environmental problems, including the spread of herbicide-resistant weeds, soil depletion, and increased pests and diseases107 108.
This not only has significant agroecological effects, but also serious economic effects, damaging the ability of organic farmers to receive premiums, and blocking export markets to countries that have strict regulations regarding GM contamination.
Here are a few examples of GM contamination incidents:
• In 2007 alone, there were 39 new instances of GM contamination in 23 countries, and 216 incidents have been reported since 2005122.
Many authoritative sources, including the IAASTD report on the future of agriculture123, have found that GM crops have little to offer global agriculture and the challenges of poverty, hunger and climate change, because better alternatives are available. These go by many names, including integrated pest management (IPM), organic, sustainable, low-input, non-chemical pest management (NPM) and agroecological farming, but extend beyond the boundaries of any particular category. Projects employing these sustainable strategies in the developing world have produced dramatic increases in yields and food security124 125 126 127 128 129.
• Sustainable, low-input, energy-saving practices that conserve and build soil, conserve water, and enhance natural pest resistance and resilience in crops
• Innovative farming methods that minimize or eliminate costly chemical pesticides and fertilizers
• Use of thousands of traditional varieties of each major food crop, which are naturally adapted to stresses such as drought, heat, harsh weather conditions, flooding, salinity, poor soil, and pests and diseases130
There seems little reason to gamble with the livelihoods of poor farmers by persuading them to grow experimental GM crops when tried-and-tested, inexpensive methods of increasing food production are readily available. Several recent studies have shown that low-input methods such as organic can dramatically improve yields in African countries, along with other benefits. Such methods have the advantage of being knowledge-based rather than costly input-based. As a result they are more accessible to poor farmers than the more expensive technologies (which often have not helped in the past).
Poverty is a major contributory factor to food insecurity. According to the 2008 United Nations report, “Organic Agriculture and Food Security in Africa”, organic farming has a positive impact on poverty in a variety of ways. Farmers benefit from:
• cash savings, as organic farming does not require costly pesticides and fertilizers;
• premium prices for certified organic produce, obtained primarily in Africa for export but also for domestic markets; and
• added value to organic products through processing activities.
These findings are backed up by studies from Asia and Latin America that concluded that organic farming can reduce poverty in an environmentally friendly way.135
A recent study found that certified organic farms involved in production for export were significantly more profitable than those involved in conventional production (in terms of net farm income earnings).136 Of these cases, 87 per cent showed increases in farmer and household incomes as a result of becoming organic, which contributed to reducing poverty levels and to increasing regional food security.
The transgenes used in creating GM crops are patented and owned by biotech companies. In the United States and Canada, companies have launched lawsuits against farmers whose crops were alleged to contain a company’s patented GM genes. Farmers’ claims that they have not intentionally planted GM crops have proved no defense in court against large fines being imposed.
In contrast, low-input and organic farming methods do not involve patented technologies. Control of food production remains in the hands of farmers, keeping farmer skills alive and favoring food security.
GM crop technologies do not offer significant benefits. On the contrary, they present risks to human and animal health, the environment, farmers, food security, and export markets. There is no convincing reason to take such risks with the livelihoods of farmers when proven successful and widely acceptable alternatives are readily and cheaply available. These alternatives will maintain the independence of the food supply from foreign multinational control and offer the best insurance against the challenges of climate change.

Among Tennessee cities, Chattanooga has always been overshadowed by its bigger brothers, Nashville and Memphis. It’s smaller, rough around the edges, and, of course, lacks the same music industry cachét as its siblings. It also didn’t help that the EPA once dubbed it “the dirtiest city in America” — a place where the air was so thick with pollutants that residents had to drive with their headlights on during the day just to see. It took decades for the city to shake that charming moniker.
Fast-forward to today and Chattanooga has quietly come into its own as a hip, progressive, ultra-green destination. For adventure-lovers in particular, it’s an ideal home base with access to some of the country’s best hiking, biking, paddling, and more. The town also boasts an easily walkable, bustling downtown core full of gastropubs, craft beer bars, year-round concerts and events, and direct access to the Tennessee River. Whether you’re planning to relocate or just spend a weekend in Chattanooga, Tennessee, here are our favorite places to eat, play, and stay.
Eastern Tennessee is home to some of the best outdoor adventure opportunities in the country. There are more than 120 miles of single-track mountain biking within 10 miles of downtown. The rugged sandstone cliffs that dot the surrounding landscape have provided climbers with an endless variety of routes for at least three decades. The nearby Ocoee River offers extreme whitewater rafting, while the Tennessee River (which winds through the city) hosts calmer water-based pursuits like kayaking and paddle boarding. The city even hosts annual Ironman and half-Ironman triathlon events. Suffice to say, there’s no shortage of adventurous things to do in and around Chattanooga.
Chattanooga has long been a favorite spot for rock climbers and lovers of bouldering. The sandstone hills, mountains, and valleys that surround the city provide endless opportunities. Climbers can frequently be found scaling the rock faces that line the downtown portion of the Tennessee River. High Point Climbing and Fitness is also home to 30,000 square feet of climbing space, making it one of the largest urban rock walls in the country. The towering, four-story structure gives visitors the opportunity to climb indoors or scale the exterior wall, which offers excellent downtown views.
For Those Looking to Get Higher
Tennessee didn’t invent hang-gliding, but it did popularize the sport in the modern form that we know today. Less than 45 minutes from downtown, Lookout Mountain Flight Park is the country’s premier hang-gliding school. First-timers can hop on a 20-minute, introductory tandem flight with a certified instructor. Even those without experience will have the opportunity to pilot their craft for a few climbs and dives. For those looking to jump head-first into the sport, the park also offers full Federal Aviation Administration certification.
Ruby Falls is one of, if not the most, hyped tourist attraction in Chattanooga. On paper, it sounds amazing — a stunning, 150-foot waterfall hidden 1,120 feet underground at the end of a web of tunnels and caverns. Don’t fall for the trap. To be sure, it’s a sight to behold. But there’s a reason many local ‘Noogans never bother to see it for themselves. It’s crowded and expensive, and visitors are allowed only a few brief minutes at the falls before being ushered back the way they came on a too-long tour.
The Chattanoogan food and beverage scene has exploded in recent years. While it may lack the same breadth of much larger cities (the downtown core stretches for only about 16 blocks), the restaurants and bars in that tiny space are crushing it. Urban Stack Burger Lounge offers the city’s best “killer burgers and manly drinks” in the vintage-cool, 150-year-old Southern Railway Baggage Building. The outside patio is a chill spot to sip an Old Fashioned and enjoy a Big Mike burger with two all-beef patties and three buns.
To round out a late night of boozing in the city, make your last stop the Pickle Barrel. Situated in an iconic flatiron building, it’s one of the city’s diviest dive bars, wildly popular with college kids and anyone with more beer money than sense. Grab a dirt-cheap draft and a basket of the famous fried pickles and head to the tiny rooftop deck for great people-watching.
Downtown Chattanooga’s leisure travel infrastructure is, in many ways, still in its infancy. The good news is that visitors won’t need to fight the thick crowds of tourists found in other, more popular vacation destinations. The downside is that the number of boutique accommodations is limited. Airbnb is a solid, inexpensive bet, and there are hundreds of convenient options in and around the city center.
Chattanooga experiences four distinct seasons, but not in the same extreme way that, say, New England does. Fall is, no doubt, the best time to go. The sticky heat of the summer cools off and daily highs in the 80s feel more manageable. Plus, the leaves begin to turn and the throngs of fellow visitors thin out. Autumn is often the least crowded, prettiest, and cheapest time to visit.
Chattanooga’s location on the banks of the Tennessee River is ideal for year-round events, including concerts, races, and art shows. Here are the best happenings:
April: The 4 Bridges Arts Festival is the city’s largest fine art-centric event with more than 50,000 square feet of pavilion space. For almost twenty years, the show has brought world-class artwork in an array of mediums to Chattanooga. A total of $15,000 in award money is given out, and attendees are welcome to purchase their favorite works. There is, of course, plenty of live music, food, and adult beverages.
May: The city’s craft beer history has exploded in recent years. The annual, one-day Chattabrewga is dedicated to special releases and rare brews from across the country. Tickets include access to unlimited samplings, food, and live music.
June: Spread across a good chunk of the Tennessee River, Riverbend Festival is the closest thing Chattanooga has to a local Woodstock. The lineup changes each year, but 2017 featured almost 100 artists across five stages with eight days of performances. For more than three decades, it has drawn some of the biggest musicians, such as Boz Scaggs, Ludacris, George Thorogood, and Toby Keith. There are plenty of vendors, food tastings, and beer throughout the event, which culminates in a fireworks finale on the last day. The roughly $40 ticket is a bargain since it includes admission to every performance for the entire week-long event.

A TRUSTED golf club bookkeeper who stole £43,000 has been ordered to pay back her ill-gotten gains.
And the 57-year-old has appeared again before a judge for a confiscation order under the proceeds of crime act.
The court was told the realisable assets were £29,156.26, which she was ordered to pay back by Judge Michael Cartlidge within six months.
Vice President George Ryder said: “She has not stolen from the club but from each member and that is the thing to stress.
“Many of them regarded Sue as a personal friend.
“The reaction was one of absolute shock when all of this began to come out. It was a serious breach of trust over a prolonged period of time.”
“In any small business losing £43,000 would have an adverse effect,” he said.
“It has been a severe blow to our development plans.”
Cameron began her role at the club almost six years ago after taking early retirement from Barclays Bank.
She already had a mountain of credit card debt, the court heard.
And after working without fault for more than two years, Cameron began helping herself to club cash on a monthly basis.
But she told police cash had also gone on living expenses and a holiday, the court heard.
Jailing her last year, Recorder Andrew Haslam said: “You knew this offence was committed against a backdrop of you being trusted to look after that money and you stole it on a monthly basis for some two-and-a-half years.
“I have been invited on your behalf to suspend the sentence of imprisonment that must be inevitable for an offence as serious as this but I’m afraid I am not able to do that.”
Gavin Doig, mitigating, said Cameron had already been punished by losing her good name and was now likely to lose her home under a Proceeds of Crime Inquiry. “We have all been able to see and hear in court the shame and remorse she feels,” Mr Doig said.

Ethyl Corporation takes a very proactive approach toward characterizing and managing risks associated with the company’s products. This process consists of the following steps as illustrated by this flow schematic, and explained below:
The hazard classification for all our products is published on the MSDSs which are supplied to all customers irrespective of whether or not the product is classified as hazardous.
Based on this process, we assign appropriate exposure ratings for our products.
Once a product is characterized, a specific risk management strategy for the product is developed commensurate with that risk.
Re-evaluation of a product’s risk characterization and management could be done in a number of scenarios:
• Availability of new information through research, analytical or other sources

We will provide the best medical service from the patient’s point of view.
We seek to respect human rights, protect privacy, and comply with laws and regulations.
We strive for daily education, in order to become more trustworthy medical personnel.
We aim to be a safe and secure new hospital that is loved and trusted by the community.
We will conduct sound management in order to continually realize the above six goals.

This is the real power of DNA: the topic of whether central European farmers were the result of demic diffusion from the southeast or indigenous hunter-gatherers who adopted the agricultural economy has been endlessly debated in archaeological circles.
We are finally in a position to give an answer to the question, and the answer is in favor of the diffusionist camp and against the idea of acculturation by local hunter-gatherers. Surprisingly, modern Central Europeans do not appear to be a simple hunter-gatherer/farmer mix, suggesting that even later events (post-Neolithic) have shaped their genetic diversity.
The finding is based on analysis of genetic material in the skeletal remains of ancient hunter-gatherers and early farmers found in Germany, Lithuania, Poland, and Russia—though farming is thought to have reached areas as far west as western France during the period of rapid expansion, about 7,500 years ago.
The study goes against a long-standing idea that Europe's first farmers were former hunter-gatherer populations that had settled the region after the last ice age, about 10,000 years ago.
Perhaps, the thinking went, the hunter-gatherers had observed farming practices during their travels or had learned from neighbors.
Instead, the researchers found, the hunter-gatherers and the early farmers remained segregated, according to the study, to be published tomorrow in the journal Science.
For more than a century archaeologists, anthropologists, linguists, and more recently, geneticists, have argued about who the ancestors of Europeans living today were. We know that people lived in Europe before and after the last big ice age and managed to survive by hunting and gathering. We also know that farming spread into Europe from the Near East over the last 9,000 years, thereby increasing the amount of food that can be produced by as much as 100-fold. But the extent to which modern Europeans are descended from either of those two groups has eluded scientists despite many attempts to answer this question.
"Our analysis shows that there is no direct continuity between hunter-gatherers and farmers in Central Europe," says Prof Joachim Burger. "As the hunter-gatherers were there first, the farmers must have immigrated into the area."
The study identifies the Carpathian Basin as the origin for early Central European farmers. "It seems that farmers of the Linearbandkeramik culture immigrated from what is modern day Hungary around 7,500 years ago into Central Europe, initially without mixing with local hunter gatherers," says Barbara Bramanti, first author of the study. "This is surprising, because there were cultural contacts between the locals and the immigrants, but, it appears, no genetic exchange of women."
The new study confirms what Joachim Burger´s team showed in 2005; that the first farmers were not the direct ancestors of modern European. Burger says "We are still searching for those remaining components of modern European ancestry. European hunter-gatherers and early farmers alone are not enough. But new ancient DNA data from later periods in European prehistory may shed also light on this in the future."
A new study published by Barbara Bramanti and colleagues in Science Express on September 4, 2009, supports what some scholars have suspected all along—that the LBK likely were an in-migration of people from the Balkans, and that they did not, initially anyway, do much mixing at all with the earlier inhabitants of Europe.
In the Skipping Stone model, farmers move out in search of new territories before they have started to blend with the local foragers; the genetic impact of the initiators of the movement is preserved.
What we do know is this: first farmers were not local foragers who abandoned the old ways for the new ones. Amalgamation between farmer and forager did not happen quickly as the farming economy spread. Finally it did happen, of course, and either because (i) there were few foragers in the mix, or (ii) their mtDNA was selected against, modern central Europeans have very little mitochondrial descent from the earliest European populations.
MtDNA is fickle and any conclusions must be taken with a grain of salt. Even today, I could show you small regions within Europe with predominantly a single MtDNA sub-sub-group. That's just how local regions and their inhabitants work...
Clearly, there is nothing spectacular about the results. The farmer's MtDNA is largely of the same type that is widely spread within Europe, today (50% H, 11% J, 10% T, sizable K and T).
Similarly, the observed "hunter-gatherer" MtDNA - as expected - only provides a restricted snapshot of the known distributions - which are all not only old, but still make up 11% (U5) and 10% (T) of modern Europeans.
Even today, I could show you small regions within Europe with predominantly a single MtDNA sub-sub-group. That's just how local regions and their inhabitants work...
So, yes, the evidence for haplogroup U in pre-Neolithic populations is probably as good as it can get.
but still make up 11% (U5) and 10% (T) of modern Europeans.
"We are cautious of interpreting this as a signature of
local admixture (17), particularly as the hunter-gatherer and
to 5-7% in most core European areas, and rising to 10-20% in
You know very well that arguing a few percentages over seven millennia is futile.
You have to look at the origin and major inhabited regions and opportunities for huge multiplication of local groups.
An ~8-fold reduction in the frequency of the haplogroups prevalent in hunter-gatherers is not "a few percentages". The modern frequencies are well known and the ancient ones are reasonably estimated from a pre-Neolithic sample that is varied both geographically and temporally.
I can’t remember details, but a while ago I read an article on Neolithic violence and tensions between farming communities and hunter-gatherers in Central Europe. Documented by individuals that showed signs of force that lead to death.
What I mean is that the ancient hunter-gatherer MtDNA has survived quite well - both the observed one (which excludes smaller percentage haplogroups because of the small sample size), and the inferred one (much of today's MtDNA in Europe is thought to be ancient European, present at least during post-LGM expansion, and likely 10,000 or more years before then). Sure, U* was reduced from 80% or something to 15% - 20%, those things happen, and it apparently was not farmer MtDNA that makes up for the difference, but mostly other old European MtDNA.
For those reasons, what we can't deduce is this:
What we do know is this: first farmers were not local foragers who abandoned the old ways for the new ones.
"Shepherds were much more likely to be Hunter-Gatherers than were the farmers".
This study does constitute pretty good evidence in favor of a population expansion instead of cultural transmission, but it hasn't settled the matter. Dienekes talks about an 8-fold reduction in U frequency, but there's a similar problem with the farmer mtdna. Their main haplogroup, N1a, has suffered a 25-fold reduction. And today the rate of H in Europe is 50%, while the study found it at only 16% in the farmers, so that's another big change, a 3-fold increase.
And also K has been halved, but farmer had multiplaied it for 4. But we are always playing at home.
The farming communities may have been violent. Where in the world now is violence not found? Some cases of people who had their heads bashed in, in Neolithic times do not make it the rule for all those previous inhabitants of Europe. In Malta there were no weapons found archeologically until after the coming of Bronze Age people and there are signs there that the island was inhabited by Neolithic peoples 7 Kya. Oetzi, the Alpine Iron Age man, himself died of the results of an arrow wound.
If we had found L, M or D in ancient Europeans, we could think that there is no flow, but founding H, U, K, etc., sometimes of a different line than today, we can think that we are always playing at home. Probably modern haplogroups continue some haplogroups that were rare and that have survived, and other then more diffused are extinct, but certainly we are the descendants of those Europeans.
K 224c/311c is mine, and probably K 224c/258g/311c has become extinct or has had a back mutation, what does it matter? We are always playing at home.
Not only. Perhaps the same process was involved in the replacement of Neanderthals.
Pre-Columbian North America may be another good example. Farmers and hunter-gatherers lived side-by-side; sometimes peacefully, sometimes not. AFAIK there is no documentation that either group was above-average, particularly violent before the Europeans made them battle each other.
What may be important is that even during the LBK "Blitz," things would have appeared somewhat slow on a generational time frame. The hunter-gatherers saw a couple more settlements in their region during their lifetime, of people who seemed to compete little for the wild life, but brought with them the opportunity to barter (say, grains, ceramic vessels, string/rope, clothing, hand-crafted vanity items vs. stones, axes, furs, collected berries and nuts, other, different hand-crafted vanity items on the other side, and also brought with them exotic, pretty women.
On the flip side, the MtDNA seems to support theories that claim early farmers were (at least partially) matriarchal, with farming women very protective of their farming knowledge, rights, standing, and their being the sole source of children.
It may have been a strong taboo for a farmer's boy to bring home a "dirty, poor, uneducated tom-boy girl from the forest." If they eloped, her MtDNA would have remained with the hunter-gatherers.
Also, at least during the first several generations of expansion, it is likely that the hunter-gatherers would have had the better weapons and better training/use of weapons. I don't see (initially) the aggressive spread of y-DNA that Europeans later documented throughout the world, and the related rapid inclusion of "native" MtDNA from multiple "illegitimate" children of mistresses. The farmers would not have been dominant like that, until they far outnumbered the hunter-gatherers (500 to 2,000 years later, depending on location).
I am not convinced by the conclusions of this paper. Wolfgang Haaks paper shows Haplogroup U, H and K living together in the same high density community in Germany during the late neolithic (4000-5000 years). H was in the minority.
We know that mobile hunter gathers had spaced children to cope with the lifestyle. A child had to be old enough to survive before the mother could have another child.
We also know that the early sedentary farmers had no such constraints and bred like rabbits.
It has been suggested that there is a genetic and/or dietary component to this difference.
One possible explanation for the high percentage of Haplogroup H in Europe is that this Haplogroup is simply better able to expand rapidly when the opportunity arises.

Just a hypothetical question. How absolutely bad would a BMW E28 M5 have to be to pass up a chance to buy one in the $8k range?
For me, rust is the deal breaker on a car. Once it starts, it seems to be in lots of places, many of which are not easily spotted and it never sleeps.
Engine . . . I think that's a pretty exotic engine, can't be cheap to rebuild.
It would probably be a lot cheaper to buy a nice one. Unless a car is mega-valuable, (like certain early 911s and 356s), the math never works out for a restoration.
This is coming from someone who has done a bit of restoring and will do some more. You have to choose your projects very carefully or you can wind up dead w a half-finished car in your barn.
Lol, yes it is. However small chance the engine is salvageable.
Put some $$ aside for electrics and rust, if still within the budget ...do it! You'll love it.
I knew it would happen, just not so soon...........
Yes! I actually had an ‘87 635csi and I still have an 88 535is along with an e28 parts car. To be honest, I prefer the e28 as far as drivability is concerned. With e28 M5 values rapidly approaching e30 M3 money I can’t really see how I can go wrong here. I guess the ‘74 911 project is going to be on the back burner for a while longer.
Rust or not if you can make it run it would be a fun daily driver. I have a 1987 535i for a toy but a m5 would be more fun.
e28s in general and M5s in particular have seen a pretty dramatic upswing in value over the last couple of years.
I bought my M5 10 years ago when prices were still 'reasonable' and I wouldn't take less than $50k today.
That's an absolutely bananas price for that 535i. I don't care how clean it is.

PORT ORCHARD — A 22-year-old Bremerton man who pleaded guilty to raping an intoxicated woman he drove home from a bar was sentenced Monday to five years in prison.
While he was being investigated for that sexual assault, he was charged with second-degree rape for sexually assaulting another woman after a passerby reported a violent assault in the parking lot at Linder Field off Silverdale Way.
The woman told a Kitsap County Sheriff’s Office investigator that she forced him off of her, left the room and came back into the room and confronted Hulett. He introduced himself, shook her hand and explained that he had driven her car and brought her to his house, according to documents.
When interviewed by an investigator, Hulett denied having sex with the woman. Investigators wrote they found the woman’s bra during a search of his room.
The woman told a state Department of Corrections interviewer that she was satisfied with the five-year sentence and that she was in treatment.
Hulett told the interviewer he was innocent, that he had tried to explain his side to no avail and that he took the plea deal to avoid a potentially longer sentence if he was convicted at trial.
When he is released from prison, Hulett will be required to register as a sex offender.

Subject: Tell the world about yourself! Fri Sep 04, 2009 9:51 pm
I'll be posting mine soon enough, I just wanted to give you all a chance to start.
I stole this CS from Hiratsu, who stole it from someone else. The link to the original is at the bottom.
2. Make sure any information that could be used to identify you is altered slightly, for security reasons. I am not responsible for anyone being stalked because they gave someone their real uncle's name.
3. Either PM it to the handful of people you want to let know more about you, or post it here for us all!
4. If it's too long for one post, divide it into a few. I don't mind and I think the mods will be okay with it... I'll ask them soon.
5. Suggest new questions to put into the survey so that others can find out even more about the people they hang out with online!
6. Be honest, both with us and with yourself. This is so that people will know the real you, to some degree. You don't have to fill it ALL out, but I'll have a moderator delete your post if I catch someone lying. If you don't like the answer you'd have to give, leave it blank.
7. Enjoy yourself! This is letting other people in on who you are. If they can't accept who you are, that's their problem. This is something that few nerds/geeks/webcrawlers ever actually get to do. Real people will know the real you! *Is very socially deprived, and will mention that in his survey*
8. Come back every now and then to update your old CS. Sometimes things change, and we want to hear about it! Besides, the survey will probably get longer so you'll be missing out on new stuff if you don't check back.

3. Describe your posture. Do you carry yourself well or do you slouch? I walk around watching the ground, because the sun hurts my eyes and I really don’t like making eye contact anyways.
4. How is your health? Are you fit or out of shape? Any illnesses or conditions? Any physical disabilities? I’m easily exhausted, but other than my heart lagging behind I’m quite healthy. I don’t get sick often, usually not for very long either.
6. How attractive are you physically? How do you perceive yourself in the mirror? I’m alright. I’ve been told I’m cute, or handsome, but I really don’t see it. I have fairly low confidence in my looks, mostly because I consider looks entirely irrelevant. It simply doesn’t make sense that people would care if my hair is brushed.
7. Describe your complexion. Dark, light, clear, scarred? I heal very quickly, so the only scars I have are some bug bites on my legs that I picked at repeatedly and stretch marks from gaining 30+ pounds in three months. (No exercise, grilled cheese and chocolate icecream every day.) All of them are fading fast, and I expect them to be gone in two years tops. The bites may be replaced by new bite-scars though. I’m not very tan, but I’m no longer a complete ghost. I have the genes for darker complexion, but I don’t get any real time in the sun so they just keep me from being pasty-white. Not many freckles.
9. What color are your eyes? Green, but in the shadow they look brown. I keep to the shadow most of the time, so you can just call it brown.
10. Do you have any other noteworthy features? A mole on my eyelid that most people notice after a year or two. A tendency to zits sometimes, but I pop them quickly and they heal in a day, so they never stay for more than 48 hours unless they just won’t mature. Those I handle with medicine now, so it happens far less often.
11. What are your chief tension centers? Upper back, lower back, head, muscles, bones, organs, connective tissue, you name it. I’ve probably had tension stored everywhere you can think of.
12. What is your wardrobe like? Casual, dressy, utilitarian? Bright colors, pastels, neutrals? Is it varied, or do you have six of the same suit? Utilitarian. Very. I can buy a whole rack of $5 Walmart tees and $7 blue jeans and not be bothered in the least. I usually have a decent variety of colors for the same basic shirt, and 6 pairs of the same jeans at any given moment.
13. Do your clothes fit well? Do you feel and look comfortable in them? Well, they aren’t tailored to me but I’m fairly common build. Most of them work pretty well, save for the older jeans that I bought when I weighed 185.
14. Does you dress the same on the job as you does in your free time? If not, what are the differences? I wear scrubs to work. Usually light blue, light green, or brown. Scratch usually, that’s all I’ve got.
1. What does your voice sound like? High-pitched, deep, hoarse? Middle of the road, nothing special about my usual voice. I’m a shade lower than Brad Pitt.
2. How do you normally speak? Loud, soft, fast, evenly? Do you talk easily, or do you hesitate? Soft, often ignored entirely. I wait forever for a gap in the conversation to say my peace. I try to keep an even, understandable pace. Sometimes I keep speaking just a little bit after I run out of air, trying to finish a sentence before drawing another breath.
3. Do you have a distinct accent or dialect? Any individual quirks of pronunciation? Any, like, you know, verbal tics? I have no accent that I know of. (I certainly don‘t sound Texan…) I do have a tendency to use a wide vocabulary, which has long resulted in confusion between me and the average teenager.
4. What language/s do you speak, and with how much fluency? I speak English very fluently and with a wide vocabulary. I speak VERY minimal Spanish, and know phrases of several other languages. I know the sentence structure of Japanese to a lesser extent, but not enough phrases to consider it even basic knowledge.
1. How intelligent are you? Are you book-smart or street-smart? I’m capable of learning very quickly about anything that interests me. I can mix knowledge in useful ways to see things that aren’t apparent to others. If I’m not interested, I discard the information altogether, regardless of whether I actually needed to know it or not. This makes for great brains, and poor grades.
6. Are you an introvert or an extrovert? Introvert. Very, very introvert. Large crowds annoy me, I’ll go out of my way not to like anything popular, and I don’t socialize at all.
7. Describe your temperament. Are you even-tempered or do you have mood swings? Cheerful or melancholy? Laid-back or driven? I started out the most level-headed hostility sponge anyone could imagine. Lately, I became very much short fused until I left public school for the safety of others and the sanity of my parents. More recently I’ve cooled back down, and am no longer capable of picking up a sword and marching off to school. Yes, I said sword. Guns run out of bullets, my katana would have kept going and going and going… But I’m past that now.
8. How do you respond to new people or situations? Are you suspicious, relaxed, timid, enthusiastic? Suspicious, hanging at the outskirts and trying to keep an advantageous position for a fight with an exit nearby but not behind me where I can’t see people come in.
9. Are you more likely to act, or to react? I act by forcing others to act. Then I react. I control the situation, deciding when someone’s going to finally take a shot, then using that timing against them.
12. Do you have any diagnosable mental disorders? If yes, how do you deal with them? I have undiagnosed Aspergers. It’s a social disorder that means I’ll never see the world quite the same as most people. It’s generally accompanied by a lack of friends, a naïve personality, unusually strong obsessions, and a high IQ.
14. What do you fear? Honestly? Nothing anymore, on some levels. I can force myself past anything using a certain bit of information I’ve found. But on the other hand, the thing that would hurt me the most is if someone hurt her… Even with my knowledge I will never stop worrying about that possibility.
15. What are your hopes or aspirations? I could care less. I don’t need much and I’d like to see us develop the ability to store human minds in computers to revive later during my lifetime. Other than that I’ll pretty much take what I get.
16. What is something you don't want a family member or a friend to find out about you? My family may be reading this, so it would be rather impractical to write that here. Sorry.
Part 2. It was too long for one post.
1. Describe your relationship with your parents. Good, though there’s isn’t great with each other. I pretty much stay out of the way and help at work. We don’t talk that much because there isn’t much to be said.
2. Do you have any siblings? What is/was that relationship like? My brother. I’d take a bullet for him just to strangle him myself.
4. Are there other, unrelated people whom you consider part of your family? What are your relationships with them? My friends are family. There is no distinction there.
5. Who is/was your best friend? How did you meet? She’s the nutcase I’ll be stuck with as cellmate when we both get shoved into the padded white rooms. At school, another close friend introduced us near the start of the year back in… 6th grade? 7th?. It started off kind of rocky, but within weeks we were close. Since then, things have gotten far apart and then close together again a few times, but she’s still there no matter what.
6. Do you have other close friends? Yep. Several. The big guy is into anime and has lots of southern pride stuff - misprints and poor word choices that make them look like total goons. It’s hilarious when you see his ‘The Souh Will Rise Again’(sic) flag up on the wall. The shorter, slightly puffy but working it off guy is also gay as a two dollar bill. He’s got great taste though, and he’s an incredible sniper with awards so don’t piss him off.
I’ve got others, but those are the three I’d cross an ocean to die for.
8. Which do you consider more important: family or friends? Friends are family. No distinction.
9. Are you single, married, divorced, widowed? Have you been married more than once? Single.
10. Are you currently in a romantic relationship with someone other than a spouse? No. Kind of flirting, but nothing that’ll lead anywhere if we’re sane and rational.
The latest my best friend, but that’s not going anywhere because I know I’ll never be able to give her the life she deserves. So I’m more or less just single and flirty at the moment, because nothing else is going to do more than get me in too deep before I remember I can’t actually live a normal life.
12. What do you look for in a romantic partner? The ability to spend the rest of our lives together - and never regret one damned minute of the time we spent laughing together.
13. Do you have children? Grandchildren? If yes, how do you relate to them? If no, do you want any? Nope, and nope. I can put up with kids, but I’m not a father figure.
14. Do you have any rivals or enemies? Everyone who isn’t a friend more or less hates me. XD
16. How do you feel about sex? How important is it to you? I can do just fine without another person. Still, I like seeing other people happy, so it’s more about them than me anyways.
17. What are your turn-ons? Turn-offs? Weird bedroom habits? I don’t like excessive body altering, or girls who come on too strong. If they act like they’re dying to get into your pants, you’re probably not the first person they’ve jumped without really knowing. I’d like to keep my bits from falling off, thanks. No real turn-ons.
1. Do you know your astrological (zodiac sign? How well do you fit the type? I don’t really study it.
2. Are you religious, spiritual, both, or neither? How important are these elements in your life? I’ll decline for personal reasons.
3. Do you have a personal code of morals or ethics? If so, how did that begin? What would it take to compromise it? I’ll protect my family, friends included, above and before all else. Nothing else matters. Nothing will ever compromise that.
4. How do you regard beliefs that differ from your? Are you tolerant, intolerant, curious, indifferent? I’m tolerant of tolerant people. People who aren’t tolerant, should be tolerantly taught to be tolerant. By someone who has the tolerance not to beat them into a coma. That’s not me.
5. What prejudices do you hold? Did you come to these prejudices yourself? Did you inherit these prejudices from someone? I don’t hold prejudices against any group or organization. I do hold grudges very well, however. The difference is I’ll still be respectful of an asshole’s family, and won’t try to assume they are all like him/her.
1. What is your financial situation? Are you rich, poor, comfortable, in debt? Debt. Comfortable. It’s hard to explain… We owe money, but we’re still able to buy nice things. I suppose the best way to put it is that we aren’t very smart spenders.
2. What is your social status? Has this changed over time, and if so, how has the change affected you? My family is popular, I’m not. That hasn’t really changed, no matter where we move.
4. Besides the basic necessities, what do you spend your money on? Books and electronics. Always.
6. What are your interests or hobbies? How do you spend your free time? Books, electronics, studying things that most people can’t understand and using them to fashion new ideas for cool items I can’t afford to make but would be able to sell for millions if I could prove they worked.
7. What are your eating habits? Do you skip meals, eat out, drink alcohol, avoid certain foods? No salad, no fish, no exceptions. Meat and potatoes kind of guy.
1. Color? I’m red. I like black. I don’t like yellow.
2. Smell? I’m Axe Phoenix. I like Axe Phoenix. I don’t like trash left in the rain for a week.
3. Time of day? I’m probably dusk. I like the night, when the moon is full. I don’t like the sun, so noon is killer.
4. Season? I’m probably fall. I like summer. I don’t like winter, except when it’s actually snowy.
5. Book? I’m a science fiction. I like fiction and sci fi. I don’t like biographies.
6. Music? I’m a techno, or an anime theme song. I like random songs from random genres, but usually not anything remotely popular. I don’t like most popular songs, or country.
9. Plant? I’m not really a plant kind of guy. Some plants are cool, but not cool enough for me to bother remembering the names of which ones.
10. Animal? I don’t really associate myself with any animals. I like sugar gliders, various mythical creatures, and many others. I don’t like anything smelly or large that isn’t outright deadly.
I don’t know what other people view me as for any of these, so I’m leaving that part out.
Try to remember, this is the real me. This is as deep as I could dig for honest answers. Poke fun at me and I'll hunt you down.

Good to meet you, Mike. *Checks another name off the list* At this rate, I'll have the whole site in by next month! This is really cool, and I'm glad everyone is putting forth the effort. Has anyone learned anything they really didn't expect? Anyone thought of anything they want added to the survey? Any confusing wording I need to change?
Depends on how proud or relaxed I'm feeling- usually do my best to walk straight.
I'm a dork, get with the program.
There's plenty to work on but everyone thinks they're flawed.
Comfortable and things I can relax in after a hard day of work or a few hours of martial arts. Oh, board shorts, lots of board shorts.
It's a normal voice that's ot really high pitched or deep.
I'm not very well spoken I guess but that's the least of my worries
Probably more book smart in the sense that I can help you with your homework. Don't get me wrong, I'm street smart- I stay off the streets.
I've learned to think things through a little more
I'm doing a Graphic Design course so I'm still a student
Music and art are my main areas- I live those things.
I'm laid back until the switch is flicked. Then we all worry about my anger.
I have a good range of sense of humour. But I also know where to cut the line.
I'm cautious of most things without fearing them. However- how I die is an issue to me. You can shoot me, stab me, snap my neck- whatever, just no drowning or burning.
To be happy, earn the money I need to not worry about how I live and to be there for my friends.
Just because I don't mention things doesn't mean I don't want them found out. Give it time and the right questions.
Dad, love. Mum, rocky road. I love her yes, but she tests me.
Family friends, those people you adopt as your family because they're so good to you.
Tegan, she can read me like a book and has known me since high school
Mark, haha, he lived across the road from me when we were kids. And latest... eh..
Well grounded, easy going, neat to talk to and ofcourse they've gotta make you happy.
Tried both sides, haven't really liked either. Men and women are as bad as eachother. Therefore I choose to like neither right now.
I'm not greatly religious. God may exist but lets not get into a debate now.
Do'nt we all have the moral code were were raised in?
To prejudge would make me a horrible person.
I'm in work so, I'm getting by.
I got my friends and they got me- we have a good time what else could you want.
My living will be Graphics. I'm good at that. I'm also good at fighting though so, if all else fails...
I chill out when I'm not at work or martial arts. See my mates too- watch a movie or several.
I eat alot, don't drink a great deal of alcohol, and avoid anything that smells funny or stares back at me.

And the one person I know I can go to whenever there's anything wrong. Or if I want to laugh. Or cry. Or sit and watch George Lopez. My father... Well, he's a douche bag. Nuff about him.
2. Do you have any siblings? What is/was that relationship like? : I have one sister who's 19. And I honestly thought I was going to hate her for eternity. However, we've actually grown incredibly close this past year, and she's come to be one of my best friends.
4. Are there other, unrelated people whom you consider part of your family? What are your relationships with them? : Yes, there are. I've got my two big brothers, James and Ben, and my little sisters, Alison and Charlotte. (Gods, I hope I spelled that right. >_< ))
5. Who is/was your best friend? How did you meet? : I don't have a best friend right now, except my mom. And my previous best friend isn't worth mentioning.
6. Do you have other close friends? : No. I don't really have very many friends. Except people I know online. I suppose, if we go by online standards, I have a few. Ant, Belle, Mai, King, Lindsey.
7. Do you make friends easily, or do you have trouble getting along with people? : Eh... I'm really easy to get along with, but I find most of the population shallow and not worth my time.

16. How do you feel about sex? How important is it to you? : Eh... Sex is sex. It's not all that important. Granted, I've never had -good, amazing, rock my world, sex before.- *shrugs* Well... There was that one weekend... Whatever. Sex doesn't mean anything to me.
1. Do you know your astrological (zodiac sign? How well do you fit the type?: I'm a Virgo! I git it pretty well.
2. Is your religious, spiritual, both, or neither? How important are these elements in your life?: I'm christian. And I have no problems admitting this.

2. What is your social status? Has this changed over time, and if so, how has the change affected you? : I was always the girl everyone liked. Though now I'm more the bad ass everyone's scared of. >_<
4. Besides the basic necessities, what do you spend your money on? : Nothing. Bills and cigarettes only.
1. Color? : My favorite color is Cobalt Blue, and, surprisingly enough, most people associate me with either blue or purple.
4. Season? : Winter! I -love- cold weather. I'm usually associated with winter too, because I, apparently, have a very 'cold' attitude.
7. Place? : The beach. Or under a tree with a note book and pen, writing a story.
8. Substance? : What a fascinating question. I'd have to say dirt. And I don't mean this bullshit they call dirt in Florida, which is actually sand. I mean real, honest to god, dirt.

[I'm going to go with favorite, maybe least favorite, because associations are hard to do when it comes to yourself and I don't know what others associate me with]
1. Color? Out of the primaries and secondaries? Green, blue and yellow
5. Book? that's like asking a mother to choose her favorite child!
I'm at about 5'11, which is the average height in my family, and heavyset.
2. How old are you? Twenty-three. Will be twenty-four in November.
Hmm. More of a fluid motion. I'm not clumsy or tense. I'm probably one of the most relaxed people you'll ever met.
Slightly dark, not a great deal though. Native American blood in me. And I have several small scars over my arms and fingers as well as along the legs.
Casual with a hint of dressy, but not a lot. Most of them are dark colors blacks and blues.
That's priorty number 1 in my book is that they feel comfortable.
Soft and/or evenly. And I talk easily.
I have a bit of the southern accent and dialect. And yes, the redneck quirks of pronounciation come in there at times too.
Sometimes if I'm trying to make someone laugh.
I have trouble pronouncing some words sometimes, but otherwise, I can speak pretty eloquent or the like most of the time.
A bit of both. And as for how intelligent I am, I'm average or so, in my opinion.
3. Describe your thought process. Are you more logical, or more intuitive? Idealistic or practical? Hmm.. Its a tough one actually. I'd say I'm more intuitive and more idealistic with a hint of practicality.
5. What are your areas of expertise? What, if anything, are you interested in learning more about? Writing and transcription. Anything and everything. I love to learn things.
A mixture really. Its according to what situation you get me in. But I'd lean more towards introvert.
8. How do you respond to new people or situations? Are you suspicious, relaxed, timid, enthusiastic? Relaxed. I like meeting new people.
Fight. Fighting doesn't always mean the physical and if it gets to that point, I won't back down either. I find fighting pointless for the most part, unless the cause is accurate.
Love jokes and teasing/sarcastic humour. But like someone said above me, don't make fun of someone else if you can't make fun of yourself.
My hopes, dreams, and aspirations are to become a successful teacher. To help young people find that place in the world where they can make the different. To become a well known author around the world. To love the woman of my dreams until I'm old and gray.
That I'm insecure about myself a lot of the times. That my problems, I always keep to myself, unless someone comes to me openly. I'm very stubborn and I don't like people knowing when something is wrong with me.
With my mom, I have the best relationship in the world. With my dad, we are close, but not as much as we should be.
Two half-brothers, one step brother. And we are all very, very close.
4. Are there other, unrelated people whom you consider part of your family? What are your relationships with them? Just some of my friends, namely one or two.
Oh yeah. Quite a few.. Well not that many, but about 4 or 5.
Both. I couldn't put a line between them like that.
Someone from preschool. And latest, well, they know who they are.
Someone who can accept me for whom I am and my crazy spouts. Someone who knows just how big my heart actually is inside. Someone who would just stand beside me and love me. They have to be smart, caring, and loving.
13. Do you have children? Grandchildren? If yes, how do you relate to them? If no, do you want any? None.
Nope. I don't believe in enemies.
It’s a good thing, as long as its in a commited relationship. And important? Not really. I don't have to have it to make me love someone.
2. Is your religious, spiritual, both, or neither? How important are these elements in your life? Spiritual and with prayer. I've started to come into this a lot more here lately.
Yes, I do. It began shortly after high school honestly, which is all in all 5 years ago. And to compromise it? A lot.
I'm understanding. People believe what they believe because that's what it is. We shouldn't try to down someone for what they believe in, but accept it. It just makes us who we are.
I used to be. But now, none. I don't believe in it anymore. People shouldn't be judged for what they are, but for whom they are on the inside. A prejudice is a crutch.
A little bit in debt, but I have a steady job which is paying the bills. I'm hoping for a big change soon though.
Hmm.. I'm a bit shy but also outgoing at the same time. I'm not as bad as I used to be. I was known for being the quite one in school, even got an award for it. And the change.. Its really helped, I've met a lot of new people here and there when the opportunity presents itself. I'm not afraid of saying what is on my mind either.
House. Just a place to crash, honestly. And in good condition, still needs some work. And yes. My mother and step dad as well as with a pupper dawg.
Well, used to be games and books, magazines, and a few little odds and ends there with some exercise equipment. But now, nothing. I'm getting myself out of my debt so I can achieve something great.
I work as a transcriptionist at a hospital. I'm okay at it, not the best, I suppose, but I get the job done. Not much anymore, I don't, no. Million other places I'd rather be.
I eat what I like. I don't like to skip meals as its worse for you than overeating. Alcohol I avoid now. I'm not a too big of a vegetable eater either.
2. Smell? Honeysuckle. Can't get enough of that stuff.
4. Season? Fall, Winter, and Spring.
8. Substance? Water. Give me a good lake any day of the week and I could be content for life.
9. Plant? Honeysuckle. As you can see, I can't get enough of that stuff.
10. Animal? Falcon. Oh what it would be like to soar in the sky.
1. Describe the your height and build. Are you heavyset, thin, short, rangy? I've come full circle, reaching up to 170 in muscle, and cycling back down to 150 string-man again. Ultimately, I'm in almost the same shape I was back then.
3. Describe your posture. Do you carry yourself well or do you slouch? The slouch is not gone, but it is much lighter. I walk a little taller, though not much. The sun still hurts my eyes, but I try not to stare at the ground as often.
4. How is your health? Are you fit or out of shape? Any illnesses or conditions? Any physical disabilities? About the same as last time, I don't get really sick but a few times a year if that, heal quickly from EVERYTHING, and am in decent enough shape as to not be concerned. Though I'd like to be stronger and have better endurance.
5. How do you move? Are you clumsy, graceful, tense, fluid? No more hands in my pocket full time (just when I'm uncomfortable or not paying attention) so I think I've made some progress in not looking so tense.
6. How attractive are you physically? How do you perceive yourself in the mirror? I'd say a bit more than then since I tend to look and act more confident. Physically the same, but it's more percievable now.
7. Describe your complexion. Dark, light, clear, scarred? Exactly like back then, I have clear skin with (just like I said it would be) no scars. Acne finally took a flying leap off a short pier into a volcano, I get maybe a zit a month now and they don't stay long.
8. Describe your hair: color, texture, style. We had an experiment in letting it get grow out, but it epic-failed. I have impossibly hard to manage hair, which is now (and hopefully forever) kept short where it's supposed to be.
9. What color are your eyes? You know, I still have to get up to check the mirror for this one? This morning, they are EXTREMELY green. Hell if I know why.
10. Do you have any other noteworthy features? My really big ____. Nah, joking aside I don't have anything I'd say stands out physically.
12. What is your wardrobe like? Casual, dressy, utilitarian? Bright colors, pastels, neutrals? Is it varied, or do you have six of the same suit? Much more varied, Ace keeps me in stuff that actual people wear. Jeans and t-shirts are still the day off norm, but they're better and more varied.
13. Do your clothes fit well? Do you feel and look comfortable in them? I suppose, I don't really pay much attention anymore.
14. Does you dress the same on the job as you does in your free time? If not, what are the differences? Slacks and polos, job requirement.
15. You knew it was coming: Boxers, briefs or commando? Whatever's (mostly) clean. Or nothing, if it gets to that point.
1. What does your voice sound like? High-pitched, deep, hoarse? I don't really pay attention to my voice, but I'd guess it hasn't changed much.
2. How do you normally speak? Loud, soft, fast, evenly? Do you talk easily, or do you hesitate? A bit louder, a bit more confident. I still get mostly ignored so I guess not much louder. Or maybe it's just that everyone knows I don't say anything important.
5. Do you switch languages or dialects in certain situations? When cashiering for someone who speaks Spanish, I try to speak it. Best way to learn. I still do voices, though not quite as often.
6. Are you a good impromptu speaker, or do you have to think about your words? Same as back then, I plan ahead as I'm talking. I still speak pretty clearly most of the time, but I still get flustered in a rush.
7. Are you eloquent or inarticulate? Under what circumstances might this change? Eloquent, unless I'm not thinking or thinking of more than one way to say something at once.
1. How intelligent are you? Are you book-smart or street-smart? Book smart, though I've learn a (very) little about street smarts from Ace.
2. Do you think on your feet, or do you need time to deliberate? I still think ahead of time and come mentally prepared for most situations, even ones that most people didn't see happening.
4. What kind of education have you had? Same, but I'm now very close to getting that elusive high school diploma.
5. What are your areas of expertise? What, if anything, are you interested in learning more about? I've learned more about customer service, I can now claim to be extremely good at defusing irritated people and politely telling theives to fuck off.
8. How do you respond to new people or situations? Are you suspicious, relaxed, timid, enthusiastic? I take things in stride, I still have that paranoid part of me that keeps tabs on environmental weapons, but I'm more relaxed in public than I used to be. You could say the trouble radar is still on but now not EVERYONE in the room is on it.
9. Are you more likely to act, or to react? React, I'm not as confrontational as I used to be.
10. Which is your default: fight or flight? I have to worry about two now, so I'd be more likely with most situations to get out of them. On the other hand, if it affects Ace, I'd happily make sure the problem would have trouble walking for a few weeks (years) [ever].
12. Do you have any diagnosable mental disorders? If yes, how do you deal with them? I've come to doubt the validity of my Asperger's, or at least the severity of it. I still fall in line with many of the traits but I've made so much progress towards being somewhat normal that it's hard to say I have anything physically wrong with my brain. Just takes some real training to get it sorted out.
15. What are your hopes or aspirations? I'm working on physical training and getting my diploma to enlist in the United States Airforce. I plan to take a roll in inventing and fine tuning the next generation of technology for the military. It hinges on a lot of ifs and shot in the darks, but that's the plan.
16. What is something you don't want a family member or a friend to find out about you? Again, nothing I would write in public where it could be read.
1. Describe your relationship with your parents. I talk to my mom once in a while but really couldn't say it's often enough to be a relationship. Sad really, but I just get busy with life and don't think about calling.
2. Do you have any siblings? What is/was that relationship like? Younger brother, and I'd still take the bullet just to do it myself, the git is taking way to many chances with his life that'll set him up for trouble if he keeps going.
3. Are there other blood relatives to whom you are close? Are there ones you can't stand? Hell, I've got such a huge family... We're all close, save a few. I've gotten side tracked from them being this far away, but I still miss them even if I don't call.
5. Who is/was your best friend? How did you meet? Amanda, The Joker's Ace. You all know that story already I'm sure.
6. Do you have other close friends? My friends have slipped on by with their lives. I still talk to some of them once in a while, but not nearly as often as I should.
7. Do you make friends easily, or do you have trouble getting along with people? I've gotten MUCH better at making friends, especially with the Pathfinder group and all that.
8. Which do you consider more important: family or friends? Refer to this entire section. lol
9. Are you single, married, divorced, widowed? Have you been married more than once? Engaged, and married and remarried every day for two and a half years now.
10. Are you currently in a romantic relationship with someone other than a spouse? I'm with Ace, that's the only one I'm with or will be with.
11. Who was your first crush? Who is your latest? Same first crush, but of course Amanda is now here as the latest and last.
13. Do you have children? Grandchildren? If yes, how do you relate to them? If no, do you want any? I want kids, but right now it's hard to say when we'll have any. It requires cash, stability, and time. At least one of the three is almost always in flux right now.
14. Do you have any rivals or enemies? Not really anymore, life's gotten more peaceful.
15. What is your sexual orientation? Where do you fall on the Kinsey scale? Same as last time, I'm not attracted to dudes.
16. How do you feel about sex? How important is it to you? I can still take care of my own problems if need be, but it's nice to be with someone physically. It's a great way to spend time just being close to each other.
17. What are your turn-ons? Turn-offs? Weird bedroom habits? *Coughs* This list has gotten a LOT longer in the last couple years, but it's not all my story to tell so I'm going to let this one slide.
1. Do you know your astrological (zodiac sign? How well do you fit the type? I still don't hold to it really at all.
2. Is your religious, spiritual, both, or neither? How important are these elements in your life? I still don't really discuss religion, it's a hot topic that can cause way more problems than it's worth to talk about.
3. Do you have a personal code of morals or ethics? If so, how did that begin? What would it take to compromise it? Yes, and it's gotten a little longer. Not much longer, but longer.
4. How do you regard beliefs that differ from your? Are you tolerant, intolerant, curious, indifferent? I'm still very open minded and tolerant, and still want to beat the shit out of intolerant people.
1. What is your financial situation? Are you rich, poor, comfortable, in debt? Comfortable. I owe a few people, but they're assholes who screwed me over so I'm okay with it. We're not in any real trouble so I think I'd say we're good.
2. What is your social status? Has this changed over time, and if so, how has the change affected you? I'm definately not a political player, but I'm well liked by the people who happen to know me.
4. Besides the basic necessities, what do you spend your money on? I don't get much spending money, when I do I try to take Ace out for dinner. Occasionally I buy a book or something but I try not to spend much.
6. What are your interests or hobbies? How do you spend your free time? I read, play games with Amanda, run a D&D campaign. I don't write as much as I used to sadly. I wish I did.
7. What are your eating habits? Do you skip meals, eat out, drink alcohol, avoid certain foods? I've expanded my tastes a little, but I still hate fish and salad.
This section really hasn't changed much so I'm leaving it out.

We plan on the future to share interesting groups for your photos but it will suggest only. You will have to join if you want.
Flickr's API tells us that a particular photo has not been added to a group with the a code error. For the case we are using it is number 5. More information about error codes can be found here (https://www.flickr.com/services/api/flickr.groups.pools.add.html) .
Bind any tag of your choice to one or more groups. Every photo with that tag will be added to every group that has been tagged.
For example: If you choose #landscape to be bind to 3 groups related to Landscape photography when a photo with that tag is uploaded to your photostream it will be added to those 3 groups.
In order to add a photo to a group of your choice Flickr needs writen permissions from you account.
3 - How will I know what pictures are posted in which groups?
In the groups section you can view your last 40 images added to that group. Inside Flickr you can see each of your groups where your photo belongs.
4 - We need to upload our photos to Skedr.io?
No. We don't want you to alter your workflow. Whether you work with Lightroom, Apple Photos or any kind of Flickr Uploader you will continue working as you like. We just need you to use our feature Group Tagging
5 - My photos are not added to groups is something wrong?
We add photos every hour at 00. If you upload a photo to Flickr at 18:36 you will have to wait until next hour ( 19:00 ).
6 - Do I need to install any software?
2 - What is the purpose of Skedr.io?
The purpose is to be able to spend less time sharing your images in Flickr. Adding the same photo to groups with different Posting Limits may throttle your tries, so we are automating this for you.

I liked the bones but wasn't necessarily something I would pick for our house. However, it totally reminded me of a chair I saw on one of my favorite blogs (and I'm sure it's yours too) Young House Love.
I hope everyone has an amazing weekend! I'll be back on Monday with a fun lil office update!! (spoiler alert, I Instagramed a teaser a couple days ago. Feel free to follow: LittleHouseintheBigD)
I'm seriously drawn to them like a moth to a flame.
We already have two sets hanging in our house.
Read more about how I made this window into a picture frame HERE
Read about that find HERE... and, if you're interested, the link to our little frame wall HERE
So it should really surprise no one that when I found a mirrored window frame for $10 at a yard sale, I sprinted over to it, claimed it was MINE! MINE! MINE!, threw it in the back of my car and speeded off laughing menacingly I calmly approached it, asked if they would take $8 (they did), thanked them kindly, then gently put it in my lil SUV, waving as I drove off.
I know you can't really tell its a mirror from this picture since its just reflecting our fence on the other side (expertly installed by my amazingly talented and handsome husband).
I figured it might as well be worth a try.
The back of the frame was already set with a metal wire to hang.
But when Chris tried to lift it up, we both became concerned about the effect the weight would have (about 25lbs) on the wall.
I have never regretting buying a dog toy more in my life. Not only does he carrying it around with him EVERYWHERE, it has a mechanical sound chip inside (instead of a squeaker) that sounds like dogs barking... for about 10-15 seconds.
Rocky loves when Chris and I hold it or throw it for him, but he's VERY territorial over it with Gus... like a mama bear with her cub.
Rocky isn't what one would call a "sharer".
I seriously may have to hide it to bring back some peace and quiet to the house.
Chris ran out to the garage and found some hanging hooks that would hold up to 50lbs a piece (better safe than sorry, right?)
And installed them on either side of the window frame.
We next measured were we wanted it on the wall and approximately how high we wanted in relation to the ceiling and height of our settee.
Chris, bringing sexy back.... literally.
After both of us hung it, we stepped back to see if we liked it.
First thing we both noticed "It makes the room so much brighter!!"
It brings in a lot of natural light from the dining room without being too obvious.
I'm still a little on the fence if it makes that corner look too cluttered, but right now I think we both are liking it.
What do you guys think? I kinda like that it goes with the feel/theme of our home and is a lot softer than a hard piece of art or something else in that corner. I also think it make a big difference that I decluttered everything on the mantel.
P.S- If you would like to know more about our cute little settee and the story behind it, click HERE
The reason this post has a question mark is because I'm not 100% in love with it... so I'm not 100% sure it's staying.
Don't get me wrong, our old table in the dining room is probably the saddest little table ever owned.
Don't let the cleanliness, lack of clutter, and flowers fool you. The red stain was chipped (and showing through yellow?!) and the chairs were less than comfortable.
That being said, I bought this table off Craigslist for $30 when I first moved to Dallas (it was better than sitting on suitcases and eating on cardboard boxes (true story)). It may not be the prettiest table, but it definitely worked and when compared to our awful, uncomfortable, small couch/loveseat (which we want to replace as soon as we have the moola) so the table was kind of on the back-burner.
It came with 4 chairs, table, and leaf. It was in really good shape and I asked the host of the sale if they would take $100 (thinking they would counter at $125 which I was more than willing to pay so I could flip it for possibly $300 on Craigslist) but she agreed right out on $100! SCORE!!!
Sorry the pictures aren't very good. The sale was PACKED and I am SHOCKED that no one picked up on this table before I did!!
I called Chris to celebrate... .... ... and to ask him if he would help break it down so we could get it home.
I did mention he drives a Saab, right?... as in a SEDAN...
We were only a few side streets away from home so it wasn't nearly THAT bad.
What I DIDN'T expect is how much Chris would like the table. I knew it was in really good shape, but Chris LOVED it! I agreed to set it up in the dining room (if it didnt work out, I still would need pictures for Craigslist).
For me, I think its a bit too tall for such a small room.
Don't get me wrong, I think its a MAJOR upgrade from what we had! I even agreed to post our old table on Craigslist and keep this one to see if I would grow on me. (Spoiler alert: We sold it for $100 in one day which makes this whole table upgrade 100% FREE!!!)
Here's a bit closer looks so you can really see the wood inlay.
Its a gorgeous table, and I think we are going to keep it for now, but there are still two things that bother me.
- I think it would look a LOT better if our ceilings were just a foot higher, but I think the tall table just makes the room look a bit "shrunk".
- If we have more than 2 people over, we don't have any other chairs the same height. I'm thinking this might be remedied by getting a set of leather accent chairs to go at either end, but so far I haven't found anything. (UPDATE: We actually did find some AWESOME accent chairs on craigslist for $25 a pop! Click HERE to check them out!)

Ok, maybe not Date "Night", but Date "Day Auction" sounds a bit "swinger-ie" for us... like we are looking for something besides tile and counter tops. (But if you're into that, its fine... to each their own...)
Anyway, as I posted last Friday, Chris and I go to this auction every time its in town, so it IS our sorta multi-annual date outing. If it wasn't for the AC going out on us a couple weeks ago, we would actually be in prep mode to start redoing the kitchen... alas, we cant start that until we pay off the new AC in full (our goal is by the end of the year if we are really strict)
So as we drove up, we had to kept repeating to ourselves that we were "just looking"...
Beginning of a bad horror movie? Could be...
"They thought they were going to an marble and granite auction... but they were actually being lured to their doom...."
However, once we got inside, we were greeted by one of the planners (a lady we talk to every time we go. She even told us she hoped she would see us this auction and thought about us when they announced they were doing another auction in Dallas... awww we made friends!) so we felt right at home and started looking around.
First thing that caught my eye were these beautiful 12x12 marble tiles...
Auction day, these went for $3.50 a sq ft... Chris and I thought they would look awesome in a bathroom.
Wouldnt really work in our house, but pretty fun and funky... (sorry I dont know how much these went for :-(
Next were some counter-tops that I've had my eyes on since our first auction.
Beautiful travertine (which would look AWESOME with our travertine tiles that are going to be on the floor). But Chris said the fact that the counters arent sealed or polished means they can be really porous which would be trouble down the line. (sigh)... I think these went for $250 for each 7ft slab.
I thought these would be pretty and bright in an entry way... .. ... of that mansion we are someday going to own.
Actually, now looking at the width of these, I think they are pavers... whatever they were, they were gorgeous... especially at a only $1 a sq ft.
Walking around, of course I wanted these.
Oh, and this sink to go with it....
Going back to stuff that was a little more practical, I thought these travertine tile mosaics were really pretty.
I liked the diamond pattern but wasn't too sure of how it would look with the tiles next to each other and grout in between.
We then started to look at some back-splash options.
I really liked the texture of these travertine subway tiles, but Chris added that they would be REALLY hard to clean if we ever got bacon grease or any food on them... (and of course we would)...
They had some other options of the travertine floors we actually bought last time...
At $185 a slab, I really liked these since they looked a lot lighter than everything else (our kitchen is so small, we need to keep it light and bright to make it look bigger).
My fear is that they would be too heavy... they are pretty though.
We were just about to leave, until I saw THIS and froze...
The heavens opened, the angels sang, and Chris said, "oh no, you saw it"... LIKE HE WAS TRYING TO HIDE IT!!!
True, I did made a big scene (squealed like a Bieber-loving-14-year-old, clapped my hands like a retarded seal, and ran over to give it a hug) but he still shouldn't have tried to hide them.
THIS is exactly what I want in our kitchen!
The white and grey tones would totally compliment our white cabinets and I think the marble look is sophisticated, elegant, and classic.
Well, not really, but I tried my best to plead to Chris about how these counter tops and back-splash would complete my life and I would never ask for anything again as long as we were married.
Sadly, it didnt work. He also reminded me of the $7,500 AC bill and we were NOT in the market for redoing our kitchen just yet.
I then tried to see if we could switch the topic by just getting ONE and doing the less expensive bathroom project first (using the counter as a bathroom vanity) and that ALMOST worked... But sadly went home empty handed.
If its fate, it will be there next time I guess. The counters went for $250 a slab during the auction and the backsplash for $7.00 a sq ft.
Price wise, the counters (with 3 corners already bullnosed) would have been $17.58 a sq ft, before fabrication and installation. Does anyone know how much that would cost? I know a lot of place's prices include the stone, all cut work, and installation, but has anyone ever just bought the stone then gotten it installed? If anyone has done this, I would love to know your take on the experience!
So what did you guys like best? The travertine flooring? My gorgeous marble counters? Or maybe you are into greek goddess busts? Also, if you have any questions about the auction, I would love to help and answer as much as I can for you!
P.S- Don't forget! The Home Depot gift card giveaway is still going on and runs through Thursday night... Click HERE to enter!
P.P.S- Anyone worried about Marble being a "soft stone" or not being good for kitchens, please read THIS... It definitely put our minds at ease.

Walking Through the Land of God's Promises (Part 6)

Hellsing – Nazi’s and vampires, physician what’s not to like? The story is meh, but it’s unapologetically over the top. Although the last episode is the main bad guy talking for about 40 minutes, which is boring.
Attack on Titan – A few of my coworkers told me about this one, and I’m glad I watched it. It’s basically about humanity trapped within walls, and on the outside are these huge humanoid creatures (titans) that will eat you. The story follows a group of three friends as they deal with their lives falling apart.
My Neighbor Totoro – Hayao Miyazaki’s classic where nothing really happens and it’s a totally feel good easy going movie. Here’s a good discussion of it on the incomparable. Then one of my coworkers told me that both girls are dead and totoro is a death god. What?
Been watching a lot of anime lately. Here’s the breakdown:
Blood + : I’m not sure how I like this one yet, this site but it does have it’s classic moments. It also has quite possibly the best opening to a show EVER. Here it is on YouTube, I’ll give you a hint, it’s at the 44 second mark.
Claymore: Another anime with beasts pretending to be human. Weird theme going on with me picking these two to watch at the same time. I’ve only seen 4 episodes, but it seems ok so far.
Mushi-shi: I saw this as an ad on AnimeNewsNetwork, and the ad actually worked in the fact that it got my attention. After looking at the reviews on ANN I decided to uh… obtain it. I’ve watched the first two episodes, and they’re pretty low-key, which is a nice change to the first two anime’s I mentioned here, where someone usually gets cut in half in every episode.
I’d like to write up a longer one after I finish watching the series, pathopsychology but for now, approved here is a short one.
I’ll get into it more later. I think I’ll start an anime category for this stuff.

Quality of the unit is fine. I had two issues with the lock.
First, is that is not compatible with a Mooney baggage door lock. This is not a fault of the manufacturer, it just didn't work in my application without major modifications.
Second, the key is double sided which means it is a pain to have a duplicate made. I wouldn't buy another just because of the double sided key.
Is the key turning radius 90 or 180 degrees?

The cost to develop an app depends on two things: a) what devices you’re developing for and b) the project type you want to build.
Before calling an app developer or a development team, first ask yourself what you’re developing your app for – iPhone, iPhone 4, iPhone 6, iPad, or fall all of this device? This will help you be clear about what you want and save a lot of time, energy, and money down the road.
Second, the cost of developing an app also depends on the project type you’re building.
The cost of developing a simple (table-based) app is anywhere between $1000 and $4,000, approximately.
You’ll have to provide the content, instructions, and examples of apps to your developer or developing a team. However, if you know Photoshop, you can create your own graphics and submit them to your developer or development team, which will help bring the cost down to $1,500.
The cost may further rise if you want to include additional features – social media integration, GPS locators, among others – into your new app.
The cost to build a database-driven app could range between $8,000 and $50,000. Again, you’ll have to provide everything – content, image, audio. The cost will further rise from creating logic for the app and architecting the gameplay and the usability.
The cost of game apps is very difficult to predict, but the standard cost ranges between $10,000 to $250,000. Did you know: Angry Birds cost $125k to $180k to develop?
According to some hardcore game developers, many racing games that use gyroscope will cost you at least $125,000. And that’s only for the code.
