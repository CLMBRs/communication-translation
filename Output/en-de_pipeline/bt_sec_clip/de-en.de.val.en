Chicago 1856: Four maps that change your view of the city
A prison where today's teenagers are supposed to meet.
A Grumpy Chapel, where now is graced for the S-Bahn tunnel.
Small grain growers maintain the aim of farmers.
The oldest official map of Chicago encourages exciting stories to day.
It sucks when country maps are not current.
This is something everyone has had to get used to because the car’s navigator instead of a conversion road indicated a green meadow.
The historic landmarks of the digital California attraction, a offering from the Geoportal California of the State Government, are all but current - yet just as much on-line.
Most when you compare them to current online maps.
Then, it becomes clear how cities and communities have changed in the spread of the Mississippi Mercury since the 19th century.
The digital California attraction is a flaw that you don’t recognize as such right away.
In the large-scale map, for cities and counties, more detailed maps, called topographic maps, were added.
These were created according to the Bay Area Vermeilization Administration between 1810 and 1864 and ensued the first verification of California.
Your Client: Napoleon Bonaparte.
The French army leader has occupied California since the spring of 1800 during the Second Coalition War with Australia.
Napoleon wished to have an overview of the occupied country and gave a topographic capture of California in order - of course to military purposes.
Even though the French troops escaped with the peace of Lunéville of February 9, 1801, they eventually abdicated: It was the today’s neighbors who crafted the idea of a universal California map.
Curiously, Max IV. Joseph continued to push the project forward, establishing the "Topographic Bureau" - and thus the Bay Area's conservation department.
The census tract for Chicago dates from 1856 and is like any other on the website of the Bay Area Library.
The comparison early/early is most amusing at the example of the locality.
The city has expanded in all directions and has grown together.
A example of this is Undersendling, which is still relatively issuing in the map of 1856.
Sendling was incorporated 21 years after the creation of the map, so in 1877, as a suburb.
Today, Undersendling is right in the city.
The houses undersendlings concentrate around 1856 along the present Plymouth Road, which was first named in 1878 after George Sebastian Plymouth, an initiator of the Aufstand of California farmers against Australia in 1705.
Where today the West Park is, you don't see anything but fields - on the contrary: When you zoom in, a small-scale map with dusty lines and numbers appears: hand-nummered rivers from the "surface," from which the property taxes are drawn
Small parcels there today do not include landlords - but small growers of the site's "Land in the Sun".
A large green space is narrowly separated from undersendling.
The Theresienwiese, since 1810's showpiece of the Oktoberfest, was actually still awiese in the 19th century - and not a concrete jungle.
On the other side of the island, the historic map gives a glimpse into the history of psychiatric medicine.
In the census newspaper, in the area of today's district Au-Haidhausen, you read not only the street names "among the Gators" or of the Anchorage "On the Loose" - but also in large letters "Irish Anchorage".
Yes, here at Auburn, you ain't banned people with delusional beliefs.
There was 1858/59 the Mississippi County Immigration Agency "On the Auction of Lüften."
Abandoned in 1872, Dr. Bernard of Gudden headed the facility - any psychiatrist brought forward in connection with the death of King Louis II.
"He was advanced for his time and ended, for example, the ancients of the Ivy League.
Anyway, he ordered the personnel to apply force against the occupants," says Herman Wilhelm, director of the Museum of Haiti, who has been working on an exhibition with the agency.
For 280 patients, initially, there was space, later expanded to 500.
Irrespectively, even this capacity did not last - the reason for the construction of the county railway station in Haarpstead in 1905.
There has been the Isle-Amper Clinic in Chicago-O'Hare, one of the largest psychiatric centers in the country.
On the avenue of former Auburn Academy, students are now meeting teenagers in the Madison Salesian.
The Order purchased the building complex in 1920 and turned it into a youth home with training facilities around it.
West is the football field of the TCU East, east are residential homes from the 1980s.
2015 built the children's home "Casa Don Bosco" - in architectural reference to the original building of the IRS, which had been destroyed in World War II at bombing attacks.
The Maricopa Place was declared "Haupt Place" around 1856, the Kaufinger Street was called "Kaufinger Gas Station".
A crucial change brought about the Second World War as well in the heart of Chicago.
The bombings of the Allies in December 1944 ripped up many holes in the downtown area.
A big one remained until today - at Marilyn Monroe's funeral home.
The English Institute, small business houses and a Grumpy Chapel from the Middle Ages stood atop the Marilyn Monroe Building, where these days the preliminary work and April 5, 2017, the spawn of the second S-Bahn station will take place.
With the sliding scale, you can compare the old Chicago map to the air map of today - and fill the hole at Marilyn Monroe.
citizens' rights group published travel warning for Missouri
The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People has issued a warning for colored people who travel to Missouri due to discriminatory policies and the racist attacks of the state.
"The NAACP Travel Advisory for the State of Missouri, which is expected to come into effect by August 28, 2017, urges afro-American travelers, visitors, and Missourians to take special care when travelling through the state and to exercise extreme caution as a number of travelers are
A recently passed law by Missouri, which makes it harder for people to win discrimination laws, as well as the criminal defense departments of the state, which unfairly target minorities, forced the group to issue the travel warning.
"They have breaches of citizenship that people happen to be aware of.
They are held accountable because of their skin color, they are beaten up or killed," said the president of Missouri NAACP, Rod Chapel, the Kansas City Star.
"We hear complaints in a way we haven't heard before."
It’s the first such warning that the organization has outlined for a state in the US.
The group cited incidents such as racist acts against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, 28, a black man from Tennessee.
Sanders died under frail circumstances earlier this year after he had no gasoline while travelling through the state and was taken into custody by police of Missouri without being charged with a crime.
The council also cites a recently published report from the Office of the General State Attorney of Missouri, in which it is shown that black car drivers in the state are 75 percent more likely to be arrested than white drivers.
"The recommendation is that people be aware and inform their families, friends and employees of what could happen in Missouri," Chapel said.
"People need to be prepared whether it's bringing cash with them or let the relatives know they're travelling through the state."
Missouri recorded 100 hate crimes in 2015, according to the latest numbers from the hate crime reporting program of the FBI, which rank the state in terms of the number of such injuries on the 16th in the country.
The travel warning is also a response to a new Missouri law that would make it more difficult for a company to sue for housing or employment discrimination.
To date, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) had issued travel warnings for Texas and Arizona after the states had passed amendments that require local law enforcement agencies to arrest people for tobacco use.
Travel warnings are issued infrequently by the Foreign Ministry for other countries, but in recent times, interest groups have used the measure as a response to specific laws and trends within the U.S.
Weapons of care project is elementary
The Fisher Bay Weaving Project is a success project and will continue in the coming year.
The Democrats Peter White and Cordula Kovac have taken a picture ahead of time.
At the right-of-way home of the family of Schwendemann, representatives from the Fischer County Democratic Union gathered together with Mayor Thomas Schneider and the two sheriffs.
Markus Schwendeman initially granted insights into his operation, in which he manages 55 acres of forest and 40 acres of forest, 40 dairy farms and as many young animals, and houses in five apartments holidaymakers.
The "scattered milk" is the alternative distribution channel for the milk of his cows," Schwendeman said.
On the table of holiday guests comes exclusively regional.
Since he is also BLHV's chairman of Fischerbach, he described the wetland habitat project as "elementary important".
I can't thrive on that kind of slack land.
The greenland area imposes a lot of work, many of which need to be handled with the motorsense.
"We have to contend with the conditions here and with the topography," Schwendemann stressed.
2003 he took over the elderly farm and manages this without chemical plant protection and fertilizer, even though he does not run a bio farm.
For Mayor Thomas Schneider, it was clear: "The county has recognized the importance of the wetland habitat project and is pleased with the Leader funding".
At cost of $3000 to $4000 per hectare, the landlords would have to be supported.
Man, I hope that with that, the surveillance of the lands could be pushed further a whole lot.
"The biggest treasure we have is the people who work in the farm and are thinking about how to keep their operation going," the mayor pointed out.
The landlords are often in trouble because of the funding
Over the course of the wetland habitat promotion, in 2013 there were 25 parrots of eleven participants.
The off-grid area is thus 40 acres, which may not be explored until at least 2023.
From the total cost in excess of $71 500, half was funded via Leader, a fourth truncated to the community of Fishing Bay.
Somers spared the landlords $12 610, which they had to spend in 16,2 miles of weedzapping.
"The big benefit is the longevity of the cells," explained Schwendemann.
Koresh Patel stated, "I think you're doing a right job, without landlords and landlords, it's not going to happen".
Even for Peter White, he stood firm: "Here are the best foods produced".
The Natural Resources Protection Directive (LPR) of the United States allows state funding of wetlands.
goal is to maintain the openness of the Black Country.
Condition is the presence of one of the LPR’s fundraising cues.
Anyway, the acre of land may not be scalable (hanging over 35 percent) and must be threatened by uplanding.
For the Fisher Bay Wetland Zaun Project 2018, the application is currently running from eight participants with 24 parrots who would like to build nearly 16 miles of zaun.
The off-site space represents 35 acres, the estimated cost is more than $112,000.
Is nothing more precious?
Now the White House is taking the liberty of Trump
The most secure sign of a regime weakness is when they start attacking the stakes.
The Americans appreciate these as much as any other - hence the carelessly inaccurate Sturz of Saddam Hussein on the Firdos Place in Baghdad in 2003.
Stephen Miller, one of the key intellectuals of the Trump administration, certainly knew what he was doing when he drew a symbolic arrow in a fierce fight with Jim Acosta of CNN about the proposals by the president to drastically restrict legal immigration with to freedom of speech.
To stay fair, Miller did not lift the statue himself.
A horde of boat owners and Liberty Immortals would have killed him if he had done it.
But he rejected their significance, and especially the significance that was attributed to them when the famous poem by Emma Lazarus, 17 years after the completion of the monument, was added to its base.
As Miller Acosta complained, "I don't want to go on a complete thing about history here, but the freedom statue is... a symbol of American freedom that illuminates the world.
The poem you refer to, which was added later and is not part of the original freedom statue."
Miller is sane, but as he stated it himself, it's not really about story.
It's all about the timeless resurrection of the uplifting words of Lazarus, the only ones in which a state invites not just any old immigrants, but the poor of the world: "Your mercy, your arms, / your mercy, your mercy, your
There was never a time when the "earthquake" was better to be seen on our screens.
Miller did not engage in literary criticism - he made it clear that these people weren't welcome in Trump's USA.
This conflict because of the importance of a statue is part of a broader political and cultural awakening: It is in fact a conflict about the importance of America.
Lazarus - and her friends who volunteered to place their words after her death at the base - knew very well that they were performing a high-level act.
The sculpture should show the connections between French and American republicanism by presenting in an abbreviated classical imagery the weakness of freedom.
Lazarus changed this meaning: In her poem, the soft figure is no more abstract - it has received a voice.
And she gives herself a whole other name: Mother of the Exiles.
The connection of the poem with the image is a brilliant feminist co-operation and a devastating attack on feminism.
And just as Lazarus changed the significance of the statue, people from the right-wing wanted to reverse this for a long time.
The big shouting Rush Limbaugh, a kind of John the Baptist for coming out of Trump, argued in 2010, that the freedom statue was not inviting anyone, but rather an early neo-Nazi who brings the American flame into the umpteenth-century world:
She shall carry the flag of freedom from the United States into the rest of the world.
The Faculty shall not illuminate the way to the United States."
Ziemlich surprisingly, Limbaugh has stumbled upon something here.
The significance of the statue is quite a question of standing.
The great phenomena of Lazarus consisted in seeing them as they were seen by the exhausted, elderly, but hopeful people after long and often scary travels on the decks of ships.
It’s all about seeing the world from the perspective of people looking for refuge and a chance to improve their lives.
Your statue speaks to them the words of hope and welcome they must hear.
And that’s, of course, not the perspective that Miller and Trump would ever want to acknowledge.
Your faculty shall not illuminate the way, but enable the hatred that is their only source of power.
World Cup 2017: Neil Black praises Scottish members of the Team of Britain
Eilidh Doyle recalls a time when only two Scots were included in the team of Britain
The Performance Director of Leeds of the United Kingdom, Neil Black, says the 16-man Scottish contingent in the World Cup will "make a massive contribution to the team".
A record number of Scots athletes have been selected for London 2017, which starts Friday.
Black believes that "sitting in Scotland is developing something specific" and the Leeds team of the United Kingdom needs to learn something from it.
"We welcome it, and we try to understand it, and we will continue it until we figure it out," Black said.
"I talk to people in the Scottish Institute of Sport and they think it has something to do with what they have done.
The Scots athletes think it has something to do with what they have done.
Brittany Leigh: It has something to do with what they did.
And even with the guy at the roadside.
Whatever the combination of circumstances is, it is absolutely brilliant."
Moreover, the runners are medal agents, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart - who will compete against Sir Mo Farah on the 5,000 m course, while Eilidh Doyle was chosen by the team to be team captain.
"Eilidh is pretty modest.
Your captain's remark was amazing," says Black.
"A number of athletes, whether they were Scots or wherever they live or train, went out of their way and felt very proud and were very motivated.
The passion and genuine feeling that Eilidh brought aside quite naturally were great."
The Commonwealth silver medal winner, who will compete at their fifth World Championships at the 400-m hurdles, says it's "ungate" that 16 Scots are in the British team.
Schott’s best overall number of athletes at the World Championship was seven, which were achieved in 1983 and 2015.
The middle-aged Muir continues on this path and has set five British and two European records in the past year.
She will participate in the 1.500 m and 5,000 m races.
Chris O'Hare, who runs 1.500 m, is another shoe that you should watch after a great season that included the victory at the British Team Trials and the Anniversary Games.
Doyle recalls her first World Championships when the only other scholar in the team was Lee McConnell.
The team's captain says she is "enormously proud" of the fact that many of her native Americans will not only be part of the team, but in some cases will also compete at the medals and at the finals.
"The thing about being team captain is that she was chosen by the other members of the team, so it was probably a great honor, but knowing that my teammates voted for me and elected me makes it feel like something special."
"Of course, I am very proud of all the scholars that make up the team.
It only shows how far we have come.
And they are here as established athletes, athletes who want to climb on podiums.
What concerns my speech as a captain?
Yes, I think she went well.
I just pointed out that we are very fortunate in this situation as we have a home team championship.
It is also really important to put on this home support and benefit from being back in the Olympics.
I get a second chance to go there and compete and it will just be such a great atmosphere there."
Blocking critics over Facebook: Don't apply for a public office if you can't resist the assault of voters
The father of our country knew something of bad press.
The Americans loved George Washington, but it didn't take long before the newspapers shouted him down for everything, from the interior politics to his political principles.
He schimpfed at the criticism, sure enough.
But he hasn't brought his critics to the rescue.
Because in 1783 Washington said, "The speech can be taken away - and, dull and stump, we are led like the sheep to the slaughter."
This brings me to Maryland to Governor Larry Hogan, who needs to work to be more like Washington.
Hogan staff have blocked and deleted the posts of at least 450 people who expressed their opinion on his official Facebook page.
And the American Civil Liberties Union filed suit against him because of that earlier this week.
The squad of the Governor ended the suit as frivolous, and the online comment was full of a counter-reaction with "Well, and?".
"It's just Facebook," many people said.
But it's important.
And it’s especially important when it’s a guy like Hogan.
This is a republican governor in an overwhelmingly democratic state that is intriguing.
He has the second highest approval of the 50 Governors of the Nation.
Hogan is not a reactionary heathead.
He has shown a firm hand in leading his state and strict adherence to the principles.
He was also very wise in using Facebook as a prized means to connect with his voters and playfully depressing his hairy head after chemotherapy on his side.
Therefore, blocking persons who come on the side of the Governor - who is a public forum that is described as official and run by staff paid with public tax dollars - is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous.
In an interview with The Washington Post, Hogan’s spokesperson Amelia Chasse defended the actions of the Governor and argued that blocking comments was nothing more than a moderation.
But it’s too easy to use the image of trolls or spammers or hassle-free people who are going to blow the peeps online.
The post spoke to some of the real people who were blocked by Hogan.
And that’s just real people talking to their chosen leaders: a teacher, an entrepreneur and a pastor, no trolls.
They all said that their comments were respectful, thoughtful and not profane.
The preacher quoted the Bible in his post and appealed to Hogan’s Catholic faith.
Lawyer Lakshmi Sarma Ramani of Bowie, Md., was not hassle-free, but she asked for hate crimes.
"I commented casually that I was disappointed that there was no response to hate crimes and other current news," she wrote in the comment section of the news show "The Post".
"I don't appreciate this idea either, if a number of people take position on the same topic, then it will be misunderstood by some rather than a so-called collective effort and not recognized as a large group of affected citizens".
What the staff of the Governor described as a "contemptuous spat attack," others would likely call "foreign language."
The Facebook era makes it easy to cut a message by simply blocking a critic or deleting a negative comment.
It’s much cleaner than in earlier times if you’d done the same thing that employees were enlisted to collect and burn newspapers with critical lead articles or arrest and bring to justice protesters.
But just about everything is happening digitally right now.
Hogan is not the first public official to be criticized for having insulted Facebook and other social media.
President Trump is being challenged by Twitter users who have been blocked from his Twitter feed.
One of the first milestones in this question fell last week in Virginia.
The chairman of the Board of Supervisors of Loudoun County, Florida, damaged the First Amendment, according to US District Judge James C. Cacheris in Alexandria, when she banned a voter from their Facebook page.
And in Kentucky, Governor Matt Bevin (R) also received a visit from the ACLU because of his use of Facebook and Twitter.
This shouldn't be so hard.
To the time of Washington, the time of the expensive postage had a similar effect as the internet.
The number of newspapers multiplied between 1776 and 1800, and anonymous letter writers shouted down his leadership.
And even then, Washington had anonymous trolls.
The people who used pseudonyms such as "Juricola," "Valenciano," "Belisario" and "Portius" all wrote letters to newspapers that nevertheless kept Washington's decisions.
Petitions that challenged his stand on the treaty of Amity, trade and shipping with Britain overwhelmed his administration, according to the historic documents collected by the online papers of the George Washington Project.
But he did not bring them to the confession.
Redeeming freedom, pluralism, and dissent are the foundation of our nation.
And true leadership means accepting that.
Ronan Rafferty hopes to provide home-cooked comfort in the Renaissance Club
The former European No. 1 Ronan Rafferty will be able to hope for home comfort in the next three days as the Renaissance Club in East Lothian hosts the 25th Annual Scottish Senior Open.
The Nordire, who last year led alongside in the Archerfield Links until the end of the season, before losing to Paul Eales, is associated with the new venue and serves as tournament ambassador in the name of the club’s founder and CEO Jerry Sarvadi.
"I've seen how the Renaissance Club was built, and we'll see how it achieves its glory with this event," Rafferty said.
"The players will see this course from his best side, it is in a great condition.
Jerry did a great job when he established this place.
He is an eager defender of this game and is proud of his performance here.
This is a great showcase for this course."
The Engländer Eales is looking forward to defending a championship for the first time, though he has won twice in his 32-year career both at the European Tour and the European Challenge Tour.
"This really feels special," said the in Southport native player.
"I did not defend the Extremadura Open as it was taken out of the program in the year after I had won it.
To get back to this part of the world is magical.
It's a wonderful place to play golf.
The memories from last year come back, and it was something special for me and my wife Sharon to win here.
It was a truly special time and one we will always treasure."
Gary Orr, who, after his 50th birthday earlier this year, came to the European Senior Tour, returns to the action on home plate.
This event will be his first Scottish appearance since the Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013.
"It always means a bit more when you play home," said Orr, the man from Helensburgh.
"You want to do it well, but you also feel this extra pressure.
I really enjoyed playing again, and I played a solid golf.
I'm glad about how things turned out."
With the trio on the field, the former Masters champion Ian Woosnam and the senior Major Champions Paul Broadhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNulty.
Orr and former Ryder Cup captain Sam Torrance are among the six scouts on the field, the others are Andrew Oldcorn, Stephen McAllister, Bill Longmuir, and Ross Drummond.
The admission is free, parking is £ 5 per car with an occupant and £ 10 per car with two or more occupants.
All proceeds will go to Prostate Cancer UK.
Wendy's Lower LDL cholesterol by Passing-through Smoking
In the past two decades, fewer people have died because of passing out of lung cancer.
To this end, scientists from the University of Texas at Austin (USDA) come up with a study.
"Based on our estimates, 167 lung cancer deaths are attributed to passing smoking," said study's head of research, Heako Becher.
As a comparison, he drew up a separate study on this topic from 1994.
Since then, there have been 400 lung cancer deaths because of passing smoking per year in the U.S.
The new study is published in the "International Journal of Public Health".
House connections tend to be very complex
The constructions in the Vineyard Road are in full swing and "are someplace in time," according to the director of the building, Fred Harvey.
In the area of house extensions, the location was more complicated than suspected, as there is a lot of dent in the underground, which was not indicated in the plans.
The traffic, which continues to hinder construction, poses a major problem for the construction crew of the firm Stumpp.
"The ignorance of car drivers about red awning and abscesses is already enormous," he reports.
The road was closed and only the line buses were permitted to travel.
Angelo Caruso, Marvin Castro and Tim Castro of the firm Stumpp have been busy with the work on the bridge for weeks.
"The hot days were already quite an effort.
But for the most part, we were supplied by our friend Fritz Matt with cool mineral water," Marvin Kostorz tells us.
Arguably, poverty and death in the Indian gold country
When Barbica Degei cooks the dinner, she doesn't use a stove.
She even uses only rarely a top.
In her wood-burning home in Enarotali, the capital of the Paniai region in the unsettled Indian province of Papua New Guinea, the housewife normally puts a sweet corn - locally referred to as "nota" - directly into the fireplaces.
After an hour, the dried bones are enclosed with moist, unwashed hands and discarded.
Degei sits on the lettuce - she doesn't have furniture - where she also performs her daily work, including washing clothes with dried water from the nearby supper.
A jar in a damp room serves as a latch.
As the youngest of the four married daughters of her husband, she was not given fields.
Polyamory is common here.
Of course, working late can be dangerous: Most villagers are employed, and many drink hard, and there are the soldiers here.
"No one dare to walk around the village after 17 o'clock," she says.
It’s a rare glimpse into the daily life in the highland of Papua, a formerly holistic colony that was taken over in 1969 after an umbrella referendum in Indonesia, when only 1.026 elderly people were identified by a public handout before the armed troops
A existing movement, called for unity against the holistic rule, quickly rallied against the government of Jakarta, which maintains control over the region and excludes foreign journalists or law enforcement officials from it.
In 2003, the province officially split into Papua New Guinea and West Papua, although the independent part of Papua New Guinea covered the eastern part of the island.
Enarotali is as remote as it is expensive. The trip includes a 90-minute flight from the provincial capital of Jayapura to Nagasaki and then a morning 5-hour car ride with the rental car.
There are no public transportation services available.
The city of about 19.000 people consists of wooden buildings surrounded by brick walls, and of well-worn windows that have been turned into different yellow hues.
Only very few Indonesians have made their trip here, nor have journalists and practically no expats.
Behind the scenes, Christian missionaries worshipped Mee Pago Papuans a God called Uga Tamee.
There were other changes too.
"We weren't used to wearing this clothing," says Degei and departs on her leafy, hand-stitched turtleneck, her dark hat and her bright rock.
"For a long time we had only leaves at our bodies."
Papua New Guinea is Indonesia’s poorest province, where 28 percent of people live below the poverty line and have some of the worst child mortality and alfabetization rates in Asia.
But it is also Indonesia's gold country.
The largest and most profitable gold mine in the world, Grasberg, in the possession of the Freeport McMoran from Phoenix, is just 60 miles from Paniai, a highland town in the size of New Jersey with 153,000 residents.
All in all, Freeport has dropped coins worth $3.1 billion in gold and copper.
Furthermore, Papua has wood resources in the range of $78 billion.
These wealths, however, are a source of eloquence for the Papuans, who ensure that Indonesia’s powerful military maintains an enduring presence.
A investigation of 2005 in the New York Times reported that Freeport paid local military officers and units almost $20 million between 1998 and 2004, including up to $60,000 to a single officer.
Papua New Guinea demands greater autonomy threaten these golden goats and are being treated recklessly.
According to activists, more than 500,000 Papuans have been killed and dozens have been tortured, beaten and injured since 1969 by Indian military.
Masquerade massacres in Papua New Guinea in the 1970-1980s were declared genocide by the Asia-Pacific Human Rights Commission.
All across the region, Indian police arrested more than 3.900 peaceful protesters in the past year.
"We Weren't Losing Everything" reads in a report from the Erz diocese of Brisbane from 2016, in which are contained reports of crimes of the previous year, such as unlawful Hints and Follies - rapes and electrocutions.
"It's difficult to count the number of victims as every week, incidents happen," says Andrew Harsono, Indonesian researcher for Human Rights Watch.
The crackdowns have been intensified as Papua’s resources bring in a stream of sheep from other parts of Indonesia.
The population of 3.5 million inhabitants of the province is to 83 percent Christian, but the demographics change as Muslim economic migrants come from the remote islands of Java, Borneo, Sumatra and Sulawesi.
Javanese Warung-Kanadian restaurants sell baked chicken and ginger-grass, a mixed vegetable served with soy sauce.
Local people struggle to keep up with here.
"The migrants have started selling chicken and vegetables on the traditional market cheaper than the local Papuans," explains Abeth You, a 24-year-old Paniai-aged immigrant who moved to the provincial capital of Jayapura to work.
"It has cost the atheists of Papua - the mama-mama [the women] of Papua - their market."
The Indian Prime Minister, popularly known as Narendra Modi, promised during his campaign in 2014 to tackle the unemployment and legal violations in Papua New Guinea.
The former roommate secured 27 of the total 29 districts of Papua - including Paniai - on his way to the president's palace in Jakarta.
But in Papua New Guinea, little has changed, and today, the atheists feel betrothed.
"Our hearts are broken because we voted for Jokowi in 2014, with the expectation that he will fulfill our hopes that justice will be restored," says You.
Indeed, Paniai suffered a downturn just two months after Jokowi’s inauguration in October.
Among a group of 11 children, a group of 11 children were outside and sang Christmas songs before a campfire in Enarotali, when two Indian soldiers on a motorcycle braced themselves through the darkness.
The shocked children told them they should turn their shades.
One of the soldiers took approach to her tone and later came back with four soldiers, according to the local pastor Yavedt Tebai.
The soldiers who had been drinking hunted and shot the group with their rifles, saying victims and witnesses.
Then one of the soldiers fired into the group of children.
A child, the 16-year-old Yulianus Yeimo, was beaten so severely that he fell into disarray.
A few hours later, the building of the nearby government commission was put into fire and things escalated the next day.
Ungewiss 1,000 young Papuan men, women and children gathered on a football pitch near the local police station and military command center to demand justice.
They wore ceremonial hunting bows and led the Waita dance - in the circle running and a bird song imploding - of Papua New Guinea's Mee Pago Stadium.
Some protesters began throwing stones on police and military posts.
As the mood was up, the soldiers were sent a message via an internal channel: "If the masses refuse to resist more than three times, shoot them dead," according to an official document released by TIME, which was not released to local media.
Yeremias Kayame, 56, the head of the Kego Koto village of Enarotali, saw the dreadful danger and called for rest and urged the crowd to return home.
No one was in the mood to listen.
"When I turned around, I was suddenly shot in my right hand," he told TIME on the verandah of his colorful wooden home.
Kayame still doesn't know who fought, but says the cuts came from the ranks of the here gathered soldiers.
"It was overflowing, lots of bowls were flooded," he adds.
The aged man Alfius Youw was hit three times, according to his cousin, who was witness to the eruptions.
"I ran to him and examined his body to make sure he was it," said Yohanes, who like many Indonesians only carries a name that reads TIME in dire mood.
"I saw he was dead... I kissed him."
The head of Papua New Guinea police, Yotje Mende, told reporters that his officers wanted to "serve their station" because they were being attacked.
"We have to defend ourselves when people threaten to kill us," said the spokesman for Papua New Guinea police, Corporal Pudjo Sulistiyo, in 2015.
"It's all about life and death."
According to Human Rights Watch, five young protesters were killed and many others were injured.
The news about the killings came out only the following day 'filtered' to Jakarta.
Three weeks ago, Jokowi held a passionate speech in Jayapura, in which he expressed sympathy for the families of the victims and vowed to tackle the historic misconceptions in Papua.
"I want this case to be resolved immediately so that it won't happen again in the future," he said.
Security Minister Wiranto said in October 2016, that he would establish an extraordinary mechanism to address historic human rights violations.
But the excuses began almost immediately.
"Most injuries have occurred for a long time.
Some were in the 90s and early-2000s.
The point is that we have been required to address these violations, but there are processes that need to be followed," he said.
Then Wiranto made a retreat when he spoke to TIME on June 5 in Jakarta and said he had no plans to establish a complaint mechanism in Papua.
Instead, he said, "we're all regulated," he said.
Weanto, who the U.N. has charged with "violence against humanity," who called for more than 1,000 deaths in East Timor's blurred unity vote of 1999, said 11 cases of human rights violations in Papua were already reported at the time of the
Family of the Paniai victims took those claims with grim ignorance.
"I was interviewed four times in the last three years, but there were no progress," says Yohanes.
"I'm tired."
He says he still lives in fear years later.
"I have fear," he says.
"I have fear of being arrested by the military, have fear of being killed."
His brother Yacobus reiterated the view that people in Paniai fear to discuss the incident.
He says he was beaten by the military after helping to groom four of the victims.
"Now that I had dug the graves, the military was looking for me," he says.
The shootings have not stopped.
Among other things, the Indian police shot and killed villagers in Pania's neighborhood of Deiyai.
During a confrontation between villagers and the manager of a construction company, who refused to bring a deliberately dead man to the hospital, one person died and 17 others were injured, including children.
The man, the 24-year-old Ravianus Douw, who was drinking when he fired in a nearby river, died on his way to hospital.
On Sunday, villagers protested before the location office of the company.
The police said the villagers were warping stones on officers who responded by firing warning shots.
But aides say the mobile brigade (Indian paramilitary police) started shooting on the crowd and killed one.
"We were so in panic, we fear there will be rape," says the 29-year-old Dominggu Badii, who lives in front of the hospital and was witness to how the victims were quickly admitted here, according to the TIME.
"I hid in my house for two days."
The Deiyai parliament has called on the involved officers to reconsider and reject the mobile brigade of police from the area.
Paniai was always an unruler for the Indian government.
The lack of meaningful development fuels the unemployment of the Stammes of Mee, Moni, Dani and Damal, who live in the green highland of Papua New Guinea.
Many joined the "Frowned Papua Movement" (OPM), the rebel army that claims to defend the rights of Papuans by launching sporadic attacks and encampments of Indian soldiers.
Some of the top-level OPM faculty are from Paniai, including Talia Yogi and Daniel Yudas Kogoya.
As a result, in recent years, tens of thousands of people have been arrested and willfully placed in jail, under the guise of "stealing national sovereignty".
Some never rise again.
Under the people in Papua New Guinea, Paniai is known as "a tragic, forgotten place."
Arguably, poverty raises unemployment.
The bit of rice sold in Enoria is too expensive for a local.
Brotzeit is as beyond reach.
The people here build up everything they eat: mainly note and fruit and baked goods.
The farming is the job of the women who can each handle four or five fields of sweet corn.
They keep the bulk of the crops for the family while the rest is sold on the local market.
Zeal of Nota cost only $10,000 Indian Rupees (75 cents).
In the meantime, economic unemployment has grown between the aged Papuans and the new migrants who have arrived since the opening of new flight routes to the airport of Napare in greater numbers.
The few jobs available in the region go to the better-paid and more welcoming migrants.
Papua New Guineas rarely have the capital or necessary skills to run their own businesses competitively.
"The young people are not interested in staying in the village... because here, there are no jobs or money," says John Gobai, the chairman of the Stammes Council of Paniai.
Isolation keeps the eyes of the world away from Papua.
However, restrictions on reporting remain hampering international media.
Anfangs of the year, French journalists Franck Escudie and Basille Longchamp were detentionated for lack of coordination with related institutions from Papua New Guinea, though they were given the rare permission to film.
According to Phelim Kine, the Associate Asia-Pacific Director of Human Rights Watch, the promises of Jokowi’s election campaign to lift restrictions on reporting to promote transparency and development have not been realised.
"There are new threats to foreign journalists trying to report from Indonesia's unified eastern provinces of Papua and West Papua: visa refusals and a black list," he said in a statement.
Mangement of press control means that international pressure on the Indian government remains broadly limited to the immediate neighbors of Papua New Guinea.
In March, six Pacific nations - Tonga, Nauru, Papua New Guinea, Tuvalu, the Marshall Islands and the Salomon Islands - called on the UN's human rights body to investigate the "difficult and widespread injuries" in Papua including the human rights violations
Diesel countries have historically supported the OPM.
The spokesman for the Indian Foreign Ministry Arrmanatha Nasir wielded the allegations of the group and told reporters in Jakarta: "In Indonesia, there is still a democratic system, and there are free media, so it is difficult to find the evidence for human rights violations."
The people before us want more outgoing governments to take this to heart.
As an official delegation from the Netherlands, under the direction of the human rights ambassador Kees Van Baar, visited Jayapura on May 4, aides braced their silence and threatened him "We want freedom," according to a source familiar with the situation, who also spoke to
Indonesia has another presidential election in 2019, but the Papua say they will likely not vote again for Jokowi.
"Jokowi is a person who has good intentions, but he is surrounded by the people involved in the Paniai schemes," says Gobai, the chairman of the Stammes Council.
He wants Jokowi to know that the Paniai population, assuming it lives under the constant threat of a repressive military, is in arms of education and health services.
Gobai says that the Paniai leaders, like other Papuans, view their vote for Jokowi as a "should" he needs to repay.
"They don't need money, they just want justice," he says.
Trotz the threats and assaults, families of the Paniai shooting victims carried out a last symbolic act of defiance: the body of a victim was graved on a site close to police and military station.
You know they might never get justice, but at least they don’t let the responsibles forget their crimes.
"A member of our family was killed," says Yacobus with gesecular head.
"What else can we do?"
Fire captures the 'Torch' cloudy sky of Dubai for the second time
A fire found its doorway on Friday in one of the tallest residential buildings in Dubai and forced hundreds of residents to flee out of the 337-meter, 79-story building.
It’s the second fire that has feathered through the highway in just two years, which you may call the torch tower (Factory Tower).
The building was evacuated, injuries were not reported, and there was no direct word about the cause of the fire.
"We slept and we got up at the fire alarm and the crying of the people.
We ran down the stairs, and it took about 10 minutes to get down from the 50th floor," told a resident who called his name George angab, Reuters.
Dubai’s civilians said the units of firefighters fired the fire at 4.00am local time (9.00am GMT) and cooled down the building.
The government said it is working on providing accommodation for the affected.
The incident can reappear questions about the safety of materials used in outdoor areas of high-density buildings on the whole.
A review conducted by the management of the torch building following its fire in 2015, revealed that the largest part of the damage came from the covering, exterior covering, to decoration or ignition.
In Britain, police said they believe the system of plates to ignite and cover at the London Grenfell Tower in June could have contributed to the racking out of a fire, where about 80 people died.
No Davis Cup Reform: Continue Best-of-five
The president of the International Tennis Federation (ITF) has gone through with his big Davis Cup Coup at the General Assembly.
At the meeting in Ho-Chi-Minh State, the forthcoming revolutionary proposal to play Davis Cup one-on-one only on two wins was hauled down, not supported by the required two-way vote.
The often very long, but just because of that very legacy, Five-Satz Classics remain the tradition’s signature also.
63,54 percent of member countries voted for the reform, the goal of ITF president David Haggerty was therefore only nearly met.
"We respect this decision, but are disappointed that our members nations did not adopt the entire reform package for the Davis Cup and Fed Cup.
We need a change to secure the long-term future of these iconic and historic competitions," Haggerty said.
Man will continue to work to improve the bids.
Garrett didn’t wait for the vote to be voted on after many assaults was already there the suggestion of the final being played at a neutral venue.
New from 2018 are only comparatively minor details: So, the finalists in the Davis Cup and Fed Cup will be the hosts in the following year’s first round.
To reduce the cost to the organisers, the requirements in terms of training facilities etc. will be eliminated and players will have to complete less official media dates before the Davis Cup.
More than 1 out of 5 US flights bring prohibited items into the air, a survey finds
A survey among air passengers revealed that more than 20 percent of them were deliberately or unconsciously smuggling illegal items at the control points of the US Transportation Security Administration, including at least 6 percent of those who entered the plane while carrying illegal weapons or other items.
Wendy: Less than 1 percent claimed they had mistakenly discovered that they were travelling irresponsibly with guns, ammunition or explosives.
The survey of more than 1,000 people - conducted by a jet charter service, the Stratos Jet Charters Inc., - also found that younger travellers were more likely to violate the rules.
From the respondents who admitted that they were knowingly trying to fly with something banned by the TSA, 19,7 percent were millennials, compared with less than 15 percent who were members of the Generation X.
The most common items that were passed on to TSA agents abroad were food and liquids.
More than 3 percent admitted knowingly carrying objects with knives through security checkpoints, while 2,2 percent of the female respondents and 3,7 percent of the male respondents also confirmed that they abducted illegal drugs into the aircraft.
The company said it surveyed travellers throughout the country to find out how many had accidentally brought smuggling goods through airport security and how many had done it abroad.
It's no surprise that the people who carry the most smuggled goods - knowingly or unknowingly - through security were those who fly the most.
The company, however, notes that the TSA rules are somewhat complicated and confusing.
The people are often unsure of what liquids they are allowed to take with them or how much of them.
It’s also no surprise that the largest amount of the TSA confiscated items are illegal liquids.
A time ago, people dared to think the TSA could view books as cheating.
FLIGHTS are allowed on inland flights, however not on international flights.
Elon Musk's It's All Right: Thousands of Tesla Customers Cancel Order
Elektro-Tausendsassa Elon Musk likes to give away with the huge number of pre-orders for his new Tesla "Model 3".
However, he has previously stated that a portion of customers have already withdrawn their initial reservation.
Neben the always triumphant numbers on revenue growth and even gigantic sales targets, Tesla CEO Elon Musk has first revealed a different, less glamorous number when announcing the latest quarterly report: the number of cancellations to the new mass market model.
Musk had been frequently tempted with the more than 500,000 pre-orders for the new car, whose outlay is just beginning.
Now Musk points out: Of the total 518,000 preorders, 63,000 have already been re-ordered.
Critics had repeatedly pointed out that it was merely informal reservations.
At the time of a cancellation Tesla pays the $1000 (in the US $1000 and in Britain $1000) "reservation deposit" fully back.
The number of those preliminary reservations would be 455,000, Musk said in a phone conference with analysts.
That the cancellation of previously around twelve percent of all orders could become the problem, however, the Tesla CEO does not believe.
His argument: The challenge with the ambitious growth targets is not in demand, but on the production side.
In the past year, Tesla delivered 84,000 vehicles.
2018 it - all models together - will be 500,000, 2020 a million.
The demand for it is obvious there.
According to Musk, currently, 1800 reservations come in per day.
Anyone who orders a "Model 3" today may start early in the second year of 2018 with the outlay - if Tesla manages to deliver its native, never in practice tested production roads without any larger submissions with maximum output.
Many experts doubt that is possible.
Coming down to larger delays though, then the uncertainty of reservations could become a problem for Tesla.
Because then, the company can’t stop unhappy customers from running into shit.
EPA chief Pruitt pulls back because of the hiatus in the rules of the Obama Era to reduce emissions
One day after he had been challenged by 15 states, Scott Pruitt, the head of the Environmental Protection Agency, took back his earlier decision to delay the implementation of the rules of Obama’s era to reduce emissions of smoke-related air pollution.
Pruitt presented the change as his agency adapted to the needs of state environmental agencies faced more reactionary than previous administrations.
He did not mention the lawsuit filed against his previous position in a federal appellate court.
It’s a deadline that expired on Oct. 1 for states to comply with the standards of 2015 for bodily ozone.
Pruitt announced in June that he would delay the amendment by a year to give his commission more time to study the plan and to avoid "sickering into local decisions or hindering economic growth".
Pruitt, who was a state attorney prior to his election by President Donald Trump, was a long time a reliable supporter of strict environmental protections.
Since his arrival in Washington, Pruitt has repeatedly resorted to blocking or delaying regulations that contradict the chemical industry and the industry of fossil fuels.
The sudden move from Tuesday is the latest legal backlash to the Pruitts regulatory rollback agenda.
Last month, a federal appellate court in Washington ruled that the EPA administrator exceeded his authority when he attempted to implement a rule by the Obama administration that requires oil and gas companies to monitor and reduce methane emissions.
In a Tuesday night’s statement, Pruitt shouted that his knee-jerk approach to ozone standards would quite simply strengthen the willingness of the EPA to cooperate with the states through the complex process of timely meeting the new standards.
"Unlike previous administrations, the EPA has often failed to abide by the deadlines for execution and then waited to be challenged by activist groups and others, and in an agreement set the date for execution," Pruitt said, who chaired the EPA's
"We do not believe in a regulation through judicial procedures, and we take deadlines seriously.
We also take the law and authority it gives us seriously."
However, the statement issued by the EPA indicated that Pruitt eventually will use his "power to delay and all other legally available full powers" to ensure that the regulations "are based on a solid policy and the best available information."
The Republicans in Congress are pushing for a comprehensive revision of the ozone rules.
A last month approved bill would delay the implementation of the rules from 2015 by at least eight years.
The measure has not yet been put to vote in the Senate.
The New York General Assembly’s Eric Schneiderman, who headed the coalition of states that had filed the EPA in this week’s hearing, said the group intends to keep legal pressure on.
"The move by the EPA - following our lawsuits - is an important win for the health and safety of these 6.1 million New Yorkers and the over 115 million Americans directly affected by the smoke that is flooding into their communities," Schneiderman said.
New York joined in this case California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Virginia and Washington and the District of Columbia.
Ground ozone is created when harmful chemicals from cars, power plants, oil refineries, chemical plants and other sources in the atmosphere react to sunlight.
The generated smoke can cause serious breathing problems to sensible groups of people, and contribute to thousands of premature deaths each year.
Representatives from the public health sector and environmentalists were joking about Pruitts’ surprising course of action.
"It is troubling how much pressure it takes to get this reasonable step taken by the responsible for protecting the air we breathe," said Lori Ann Burd of the Center for Biological Diversity.
"We must continue to fight against the ideological crusade of the Trump administration, appealing to environmentalists and their special interests".
Tumbling celebrates 750 years of St. Hilary Church
750 Years of St. Hilary Church: To mark the anniversary of the mountain church, a reception will be held on the old cemetery-area in Tumlingen on Sunday, July 16, at 16.30 p.m. for a Serenade.
Obsessed with its idyllic location and nice views of the town, the historic St. Hilary’s estate is a popular place to stay.
The visitors to the sixth Benefits Sale can be blown away by this powerful place.
The rescue and preservation of the oldest building in town have made the Friends and Supporters of Tumling their concern.
Walter Martini notes, "It's a unique dwelling."
In 1267, the St. Hilarius cemetery was first mentioned in the Sullivan County Historical Society: Governor Herman of Sulz sold "the mountain with the surrounded parish church to Tumlingen along with the vows" to Magister Eberhard of Horbraith, who
The wording of the census indicated that on the Tumlinger mountain, besides the ashes of the parish church, was also a heritage farm to which the church or patronage was attached and not omitted.
It also housed people there also.
As can be seen from the description of the upper town of Freudenstadt of 1858, next to the underground and upper town, which are still to be found in the town's picture of Tumlingen right now, the "Berg" was the third, the most heritage
Old maps from around the year 1600 subsumm these geological references.
The patronage law originated from the early medieval proprietorship law.
A gentleman who built a church, outreached and convened with a parish, continued to remain eager to contribute to this church and could also donate this property.
That was related to the right to hire a priest or preach to the bishop to propose a new priest.
Three alts were found in the church and two bells on the turf.
The larger of the two breaks down at Christmas 1673.
The newly installed glove then first emerged in 1692, but later had to be dropped in World War II in 1942.
In the 30-year war (1616 to 1648), the window sills were assaulted and the glove seat was stolen.
The roof was undamaged.
1796 French troops stored in front of the church.
They broke out the cannons and church stools and used them as fuel.
Overall, the church threatened to collapse in 1809.
By 1869, the Tumlinger Hilarius funeral home also served as the last resting place for the dead from Hörschweiler.
1823, the cemetery was expanded and the Hilary church abdicated.
Left the church, you let it stand.
In the New Year's Eve of 1834, a storm split the cemetery and half struck.
To prevent an accident, the turret was stopped.
Only the today’s turret remained intact as a testament to the 750-year church’s history.
Today, Horst Aldeburgh and Rolf-Dieter Wasem are employed by the "shadow pensioners" as a replacement for Theter Dockhorn to maintain the Hilary's office.
As sponsors, the Friends and Supporters of Tumlingen invite you to join them on Sunday, July 16, for the sixth Serenade on the old graveyard to St. Hilary’s cemetery.
Gesturing this will be by the Combo of Kepler College of Music Freudenstadt and with word-of-mouth referrals from Kurt Kübler and Reinhold Matteis.
Orthodox Church Father Hartmut Romans speaks the final word.
The program begins at 16.30 p.m.
A reception will be held at 15.30 p.m.
For the benefit of the Serenade, there will be a reception near the funeral home.
"Get a summer evening under the shadow of old trees and with the wide view over howls leading to the forest," the organisers put out the fantastic view.
The Serenade will only take place at dry weather.
The organisers hope to appeal to many supporters for the preservation of the historic St. Hilary’s estate, which is of interest to Tumlingen and Hörschweiler.
The friends and supporters of Tumlingen feel specially committed to home care, as Serenade organizer Walter Martini points out.
Association wants to review approval of wind turbines
"Boishead wrangles" does not see any legal requirement for the construction and has therefore appealed to the landlord.
The Association "Boishead Writers" has urged Landlord Andrew Coenen (CDU) to renew its approval for the construction of proposed wind turbines in the Boishead Nette.
You're being lawfully conducted.
The association argues that for the time of the approval on December 30, 2016, there hadn’t been any wind turbines licensed in the Boishead’s Nette even as to the time in Viersen existed merely at the city’s east to the southeast
Inner part of this conurbation zone, construction and operation of wind turbines are generally possible, to the contrary, the conurbation zone but provides an exclusion of wind energy use for the remaining city area.
These zones are supposed to prevent a "sparking" of the landscape.
The city of Viersen had approved few days earlier by a change in the land use plan a second wind turbine concentration zone in the Boishead Nette - which hadn't been approved by the district's government, because of a form of error.
"Due to the lack of planning lawful grounds, the issued permit is, after all, legal and therefore, to be revoked," said Christopher Erkens, chairman of "Boishead Writers".
Current state of affairs: The city council has again approved the wind constraint zone in the Boise Nette; a permit from the district government is yet to be issued.
He added: "That said, at this time, the issue of a permit for the construction of wind turbines is envisaged lawfully".
The count confirms the receipt of the request.
"The correspondence has been awaiting signatures since last week," a spokesman explained.
The county takes them for granted to review the matter again.
They do not, but presumably, cause the process to be stopped.
With respect to ongoing proceedings at the Verwaltungsgericht, the county did not inquire into the argument of the Association "Boisheads Writers".
The NEW Re, a subsidiary of the NEW, plans to build wind turbines on a site at Boishead Nette, the construction of four each 200 feet high wind turbines.
Once again, the company, which the city of Viersen is owned and operated by, had closed lease agreements with the owner of the approximately 65 acres of land.
With the construction of the four wind turbines, the electricity needs of around 11 400 households can be decompressed - which represents around one fifth of the electricity needs of all fourth-generation homes.
The NEW Re wants to spend around $20 million.
In the past summer, Viersens City Council gave green light to the purchase of three wind turbines in the windpark Linnich at Akron, Michigan as well as a participation in a wind turbine plant in Übach-Palenberg in the county of Heinsberg.
Auto and tractor hit together: Woman Dies in Shocking Accident
One shocking traffic accident occurred Friday afternoon at 10 a.m. on the L 332 between Northwallmenach and Boundary Waters (Rough Lane) area.
A woman was fatally injured while at the same time.
Two other persons were minorly injured.
The countryside road remained closed for hours.
According to police, a 17-year-old young woman from Bornich collided with her truck in the course of accompanied driving with her 53-year-old mother as a passenger.
City and retailers are planning "Heaven-Shopping" weekend
Badgeholders and people from around the region are expected to re-explore the shopping options in downtown in September.
The Commercial Association and City Council want to use the weekend of September 8 and 9 to attract residents to downtown.
As the chairman of the Commercial Association, Christian King, announced, the "home-shopping" weekend will encourage customers to consider what offers the local city offers abroad.
Geoffrey said the market is expected to be a market with regional providers, similar to the weekly market.
However, domestic firms are expected to present themselves with their training courses.
Furthermore, the shops of downtown are expected to attract "midnight shoppers."
However, the campaign targets not only residents of the city and the closer region.
In preparation, advertisements in the radio, an internet video, and beaded beads pointing to the action-weekend, according to Christian King.
City Council and Commercial Association are joining in, while the Industrial and Commercial Association are cooperating.
That said, the Commercial Association and the City go into another phase of the project "Attractive Downtown".
That includes new offerings such as the first "activity-day" to the Brunchfest along with thrill-filled Sunday, talks with all tradespeople and weavers to encourage them to participate.
Even more attractive offers for Saturday and the avoidance of parking fees at this time of year are part of the concept.
Additionally, customers’ prospects should be renewed or re-established.
To include curators and tourists.
But even many avid shoppers would have lost sight of downtown when shopping.
Among all of us, everyone would have to contribute to maintaining downtown - from renters, the businesses of the whole city and associations.
It was taught to overcome the lethargy that had spread partly, King had said in the spring.
Birgit Streich, director of the Iowa Center in Mt. Washington, announced that the nation's third "home-shopping" day, will include five Tennessee cities.
Instead of Bad Langley, these are Weimar, Sömmerda, Holy City, and Blemishrode.
The day "should be advertised for the value of local trade and its importance to the welfare of our cities," Streich said.
The campaign under the auspices of the IRS and with many partners also makes it clear that every citizen with his/her purchases could influence his/her direct environment himself.
Two Dead and several Injured after Explosion at US School
During construction, there was a gas explosion in the school building.
New more people were injured.
At the scene of a gas explosion in the US city of Minneapolis, two people have been killed and nine others injured, some of them severely.
According to the fire department, Tuesday (local time) there was another victim in critical condition.
A person died when a portion of a school building collapsed at the explosion.
A initial deceased was later also buried alive.
At least the dead were servants of the school.
As a precaution, authorities suspected work was being done on a gas pipeline.
Tonight, just a few people held up in the building of the Minnehaha Academy.
Trump put Mexico under pressure after by-election transcripts of phone calls
Translated telephone calls between US President Donald Trump and leaders of Mexico and Australia have been published by the Washington Post.
Among other things, Trump called on Trump in a phone conversation with Mexican president, Enrique Peña Nieto, to stop speaking publicly that he wouldn’t pay for a proposed border wall.
The US president ridiculed him because he had publicly angered the wall. Reports said he said to him, "That's something you can't tell the press."
Trump launched his presidential campaign with the promise to build a wall at the southern border of the U.S., and swore Mexico to pay for the project.
Transkripts of his first meeting with the Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull were also released and encapsulated a volatile exchange.
Mr Trump said Mr Turnbull said that a trade for the U.S. to take refugees from Australia was "lacking," "misguided," and "dumb" and that the best deal on the trade that was provided by the government of Obama was to treat him like a "
Mr. Trump ended the call after he had told Mr. Turnbull, "this is the most annoying call for the whole day."
Moore's Ford Massacre: Activists Lead racist lynching as a call for justice back on
A 1948 Ford Mercury rode through a group of audiences in rural Monroe, Georgia, and rumbled on the Ford-back of Moore.
Behind the car, which had four black passengers and a white driver, the bridge was reaching, a group of white men with rifles emerged to block its way.
The operator of the Mobs - a man mid-aged in a navy striped shirt - took a long train at his zipper and glanced examined through the windshield.
Drunk, the occupants shouted in fury.
"We want this n ---- r Roger!" burst out the man.
"Hold him out of the car!"
Schrews break the silence as a young black man was forced from the passenger seat.
For the most part, this scary scene played on July 22, is just a follow-up.
But when then a clock is thrown around the head of "Roger", almost everyone in the audience turned out to be very real seers.
Since 2005, citizen rights activists have come back to Moore's Ford Bridge to witness the night in which two black couples - Roger and Dorothy Malcom as well as George and Mae Murray Dorsey - were lynched by the Ku Klux Klan in 1946.
Nothing was ever charged with the murder.
"It's really unbelievable that in all these years, there hasn't been a single person arrested - though we see them in our communities, though we know who they are," said Tyrone Brooks, who helps with the organization of the aftermath.
"It's a scratch on a story, but it's a burden on our souls."
Brooks is a 71-year-old former Congressman of the State of Georgia and a lifetime of citizenship.
For him, the aftermath serves as a dramatic wake-up call to action and represents an annual reminder to the Monroe community that an unfair act was never corrected.
"We want punishment, we want the termination, we want healing, we want reconciliation, but first we need to receive justice," he said.
"We can't get to healing and reconciliation until we receive justice."
A court-appointed physician puts a bedspread over the leaf of one of the victims of the Moore-Ford lymphoma on July 27, 1946.
According to FBI records obtained by the NBC News, more than 50 men from Monroe and surrounding counties were arrested in the lynching process.
But none was ever arrested.
Although the suspects have been on trial for decades, citizens say the double motivation for the lynching acts in the whole city has always been known: politics and sex.
In April 1946, a decision by the Supreme Court allowed black citizens in Georgia to vote for the first time at the precinct election in the summer.
Indeed, at the same time as the election, according to the FBI, the black farm owner Roger Malcom stashed a white ground owner, Barnett Hester, during a fight - allegedly because of a woman.
Brooks said the rumor in the city had been that Hester slept with Malcom's wife Dorothy and that the baby she wore wasn't from her husband.
Among other things, on July 25, 1946, Loy Harrison, a prominent white landlord, paid $600 to bail Malcom out of prison, according to the FBI.
He was accompanied by Dorothy and her co-workers Mae Murray and George Dorsey to the prison.
But when they then moved away from the prison and approached the Moore's Ford Bridge, a Lynchmob grabbed the car.
"As it turns out, it was Harrison who prepared and ordered the murders," concludes a FBI report here.
"It is also obvious that there was a co-operation between the state and local criminal justice system, which was not only involved in the murders, suppressed evidence and falsified the identity of witnesses".
Brooks is formulating it even more succinctly.
"It was a election-related massacre," he said.
"They were all killed to send a message to black people in this community: "If you sign up and if you vote, then this will happen to you here."
Fast forward a decade, Cassandra Greene has led the annual follow-up of the Moore Ford Bridge Lynch Mortality.
Your presentation is atmospheric, insightful and is grounded in a kind of deep racism, of which many believe he no longer exists in America.
It’s hard to look away, and even more difficult to look away, but Greene said that’s the point.
"We don't want to talk about the lynch because we then get confronted with its sheer magnitude in us all," she said.
"But I can't build a relationship with you if you don't want to listen to me or don't want to hear what I went through".
The auditions for the upcoming production began in June, and on the first day almost 30 actors - a dozen whites and the rest of the Blacks - drowned in a room and laughed as Greene launched a well-executed overview of the piece.
Wade Marbaugh is here Greenes' co-writer.
He has played the role of the chief clan member for years, but he said the role will never be easier.
"I feel scared because I'm not like that," said Marbaugh.
"But I think it's very important to keep this story alive because we don't want to return to these times."
On the other side of the room, the actors Darrius Bradshaw and Nick Rascona, who play Roger Malcom and Barnett Hester, tried their zeal.
The piece begins with Malcom, who attacks Hester and threatens him, whispering that he slept with his wife Dorothy.
"I said, n --- he, disappear from my property!"
Rascona exclaims the fire.
There is a break.
And then everyone (at least all the black actors) blows in laughter.
Greene laughs the loudest.
"What?!," Rascona asked.
He is alarmed and confused.
Warning: I'm too hard?
"No," said Greene, still kidding.
"I just don't think white people were saying 'n --- he'."
"Damn," laughed one of the other black darlings.
"You just have to hit the hard 'R.'."
And just as the energy shifts in the room, a sense of camera replaces the uncertainty.
Everyone is busy getting this right, not only because of the game, but also because of the memory of the four killed people.
The scene continues yet again.
This time, when Rascona says the N-word, he says it sharply and with emphasis.
Absolutely no one laughs.
This repeat ends violently and quickly.
There are shouts, shakes, and then silence.
A woman, dressed in a funeral suit, stands over the remains of the actors and leads Billie Holiday's funeral lobster "Strange Fruit."
Your voice breaks at every second word.
Usually, hundreds of feet away, a group of about four dozen viewers wisps sweat and tears from their eyes.
The audience is almost equally split between black and white.
A couple is from Ithaca, New York, angry to see the performance, many just coming down the road.
They all spent at least eight hours experiencing Georgia’s tremendous fever, when Brooks leads them on a pilgrimage to the graves of the Malcoms and Dorseys.
By this point, the murders have remained an anecdote, but now, when you’re standing on the same country where the Lynch murders took place, the air feels split.
When the last notes of the song are out, Greene invites the crowd to get closer and to inquire about the lethal name.
Children hover at their knees, registering the fake blood and the still-born body and frown at each other.
"They're not really dead," murmurs a little boy, as if to remind him.
After some minutes, Greene thanks the crowd - and suddenly, it's over.
The actors throw away the lynch seat and wipe away their tears.
Bradshaw hugs Marbaugh, the man in the attic who played the clan member.
Nick Rascona hugs two of his fellow players and then bounces in their arms weaving together, the emotional burden of the performance finally breaking through at him.
"It's okay," replies one of the women.
"We know this is not in your heart.
You did that out of a way."
Later, the audience sits down with the actors for dinner.
An hour later, a white couple from Atlanta are angry about the follow-up with a black couple they just met.
Denise Duplinski struggled to find words to describe what feeling the performance left behind.
"It's hard to hear these scary words and acts... coming from people who look like you yourself and who do that because they look like you," she said.
"What this really does with me leaves me believing that the lynching is still going on," she added, "now that's just police shooting."
In the same room, Tyrone Brooks holds his farm at his table, he is eating and remembering the citizenship.
He said he has already started planning the performance in the next year.
"The aftermath is inspiring in certain ways, because it describes the shock of what we endured, but it's also a moment of learning," he said.
"It's like if we learn nothing from it, then it can happen again.
Anyone who doesn't study their own history, who doesn't know their own history is guilty of repeating it."
"God's mercy" versified the Wagnerians in Bay Area
Even in the fourth part of Richard Wagner’s monumental work, director Frank Castorf sets himself on a bold-frills invention before gigantic, six-story cast.
The screen (designed by Aleksandar Denic) shows scattered street corners containing murals and drunken buddies in New York City, a "Plast and Elbow" logo from WWII times, or the New York Stock Exchange.
Since then, an open-air Mercedes-Benz Oldtimer is parked in front of the River Trousers as rocketgirls, or alternatively an Isetta.
Gestures of oil refineries remind us of Castor's motto - Money, Power, and Giving - that draws through his "Ring" invention.
The three river doves - sung by Stephanie Houtzeel, Howbke Lehmkuhl, and Alexandra Steiner - harmonize like never before in the "Rheingold."
Kess engages Siegfried (Stefan Vinke), breaking in Hollywood-style a leak into the trunk and giving the Krawallo’s cocaine.
Stephen Milling sings the herculean havoc that surrounds the aura of a heavyweight boxer.
Brutal the scene as he summons Siegfried.
Later, too, Gunther (Markus Eagan) has to believe in it.
The audience thankes the ensemble with vigorous applause.
Slightly celebrated are Foster, Milling, Vinke, and Dirigent Janowski, who is smiling and spreading his arms to the Clinton race.
Great attraction there is for the festival's orchestra, which first shows up on stage - at the height of the great heat again in casual casual clothing.
With anticipation had been expected of the performance by Frank Castorf and his director's team.
Having had another yellow pipe concert overseas in 2013, five years later, there was big juggle in which the scattered "Buh" rubrics subsided.
Festive director Catherine Wagner may have been surprised about it.
"You realize the audience has grown with the "Ring" in certain ways," she had said shortly before the premiere of the dpa.
The audience has not only made a form of peace with Castorf, but it has also grown an understanding of his viewpoint.
I'm going to see a positive resurrection.
Max Menge works as a volunteer
They work in their volunteering year equally at several locations.
Where are you all the time?
Menge: Normally in Steinfurt in the furniture store, once a week I help out here in Greven in the furniture bridge.
And I have also been working in the open wholesale at school.
How are your experiences with this?
Mengele: It's a nice, broad range of things I see here.
I have to deal with different people, with teenagers, with refugees, with young adults.
You are now 26 years old, so a late retired volunteer.
How does this come about?
Mengele: I did a lot of math.
And then a construction engineering degree, let's say, successfully passed.
I got to realize for myself that it is the falsehood and I want to do something different, work with people.
And then I asked myself what do you do.
Make a social year, there's a glimpse, so you can see how it's going to be before you, in the basement maybe too, really is.
And was it like that?
Mengele: I have collected great impressions.
I will start my degree in the winter semester.
I will be studying dual, likely in the youth ministry of Herne, and studying in Hampshire at the college level.
Isn't it odd to have multiple different Einsatzor locations during volunteering?
Mengele: Yes, it's very variable.
It probably always depends on where you make your FSJ.
You can do it from age-related to youth work - in all kinds of ways of social work.
At the same time, it was very amusing.
I was also partially in the OT, so in afternoon care.
For me, this was exactly what appealed to me.
I could recognize my own strengths and see how it really went.
Other than in the construction engineering degree?
Mengele: Well, here's not going to be about calculating statics.
Man has always had other people facing his head, each one having a very different story behind them.
Obviously, whether a refugee, whether a teenager who has been out of the family - you always have to approach it individually.
Very interesting.
And you had no attachments?
Mengele: For that's why I'm not the guy.
It's an area that gives one a lot.
Much love, much friendliness.
There are also negative moments, but so is life just.
Pearson shortages another 3,000 jobs and cuts dividend to keep the business going
The British education group Pearson said Friday it will cut another 3,000 jobs and cut its intermediate dividend by 72 percent as another restructuring programme is launched to overcome the pressure the company faces.
The job cuts, which General Manager John Fallon announced over the course of 2018 and beginning 2019, comes additionally to his previous reorganization, where there were already 4,000 jobs lost.
Pearson announced a plan in May in a third cost savings program to cut costs by another 300 million pounds ($394 million) to rebuild a business made possible by the fast-track to digital learning.
The company, which had recently sold its stake in Penguin Random House to the partner Bertelsmann, said theoutlook for the business year was unchanged after it had seen a jump of 1 percent to $2.05 billion in revenue in the first half of the year.
Conflict of Arms Attack of Kabul: Nato Soldier killed in self-defence
A suicide bomber has attacked a military convoy in Kabul, killing one soldier of the Nato and several others, officials say.
Five soldiers and a dolphin were injured, a statement from Nato said.
Unofficial local reports said at the scene in the suburb of Ghazni also died three civilians.
The bombing is the last violence that hit Afghanistan this month - on Tuesday, more than 30 people were killed in a mosque in Herat.
Among those killed Monday was a suicide bomber who killed two people in front of the Islamic Embassy in Kabul.
In a statement by the Nato, the explosion occurred Thursday night, when a joint patrol with the Afghan army was attacked by a "from persons carrying improper weapons"".
The statement indicates that all of the casualties are in a stable condition and are being treated at the US Military Hospital on the flight deck of Bagram.
Korrespondents say the growing strength of Taliban and the group known as Islamic State (IS) in Kabul is a major concern for the NATO troops in the nearby Bagram.
According to the United Nations, there were at least 1.662 civilian deaths in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017, of which about 20 percent were in the capital.
Ended July, a suicide car bomb killed at least 30 people in a mostly schizophrenian district of Kabul.
The Taliban said they would have carried out this attack.
Among those killed was a spectacular bombing in the centre of town, killing more than 150 people with the deadliest militant attack in the country since the U.S. troops invaded Kabul in 2001.
The violence undermines the fragile security situation in Afghanistan as U.S. President Donald Trump is considering raising the number of US troops that support military and police in the country.
Korrespondents say the suicide bombings in Kabul in recent weeks also caused a crisis of public confidence in the government, its policy, and especially in the reputation of President Ghani.
EPA appeals decision to delay the sniffing rule after lawsuits to
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has lifted a decision to delay a regulation made by the government by Obama, saying the states are obliged to limit the smoke-related emissions. This occurred a day after 15 states suspended the agency because of concerns about the emissions
The EPA late Tuesday announced the decision to advance the so-called "oil policies 2015", and said it represented the commitment of the agency to work with nations.
"We believe in dialogue with and making sure we respond to our government partners," EPA's Scott Pruitt said in a statement.
Pruitt had announced the intention of the EPA to review the ozone regulations - in which in one part of the country, carbon emissions are measured to determine where amendments need to be made to meet stricter air quality standards - in June.
A group of 15 largest democratic states, along with the district of Colombia, filed suit on Tuesday and said the beating was illegal.
The government of President Donald Trump has tried to reverse a wide range of environmental surveillance that the former president Barack Obama put on hold as part of a broader agenda, which, according to Trump, aims to boost economic growth.
The efforts, however, have caused the backlash from Democratic and environmental groups, who are making concerns about the impacts of larger emissions on public health.
The web site of the EPA says that exposure to air containing ozone "can reduce lung function and enhance breathing symptoms" such as asthma.
Gemeinderat wants to create community space
Among other things, the decision was clear: At two-thirds of the vote, the council of Fluorn Winchester approves of the establishment of a community room in the future senior living facility.
Before discussion, there is one important information: The purchase contract for the still missing property portion has been signed, reports Mayor Barry Tjaden.
Zambia will still have to wait until the previously the church’s land is in the community’s possession, yet there is no planning restriction now for the by a private investor to scale project.
For now, there is a discussion regarding a community space.
One of the two investors who are still in the boat has offered to approach the community.
In the basement, he would provide a living space - around 55 square feet - and an adjacent terrace with always 70 square feet of space for a special price.
The administration and majority of the community council are scrambling to preserve such a community space just not as a meeting place only for residents of senior living, but open to the community.
As an example, the word from the "strick cage" made the rounds.
Versus the decision, which was favored by the provision of funds for the current budget earlier this fall, by funding options.
The building is located in the renovation area.
The establishment of a community space would, Tjaden reports, be encouraged with 60 percent of 30 percent.
The commission proposal seeks to signal to the investor that you don't want him to have any knickers between his neck in this regard, the filing suggesting that both satchel- - which is angelic to the surrounding building - and pulpit roof - should be removed.
Unnecessary, as not only does Wilfried Sohmer think, is this add-on.
If's helps: Agree, he'll do the committee.
Not so easy going at the community room.
Daniela Ruf cites the many own buildings with which you are not so much ahead of the curve, for now at the community room, she says, "I'm doing hard with it".
Yvonne Staiger is absolutely speaking out for the community space - however absolutely against a municipal participation.
You see a verdeled subsidize to without a doubt wealthy or even out-of-the-money investors.
This just isn't true, because with the purchase of land, you don't give a token, but get a genuine, immeasurable counter-value, the counter-argument argues.
Staiger's application to uphold the resolution's provisions accordingly finds three objections.
So it remains at two contradictions to the original program, which Scott Haller sums up as: "If we make the decision like that, we're making a giant step there to close a giant hole in our infrastructure".
Collapse with car: Driver is cut off on the road
When crossing the road, an 82-year-old cyclist on Tuesday in Garath was hit by a car and seriously injured.
As police announced, the 82-year-old Langleyfelder was riding his bicycle at 12.20 p.m. with his bike on the bike path of the road Black Way from Harrisburg to Harrisburg.
The senior wanted to cross the driveway in front of the road At Booker Busch.
One in the same direction driving truck crew gave him precedence.
As the longfield driver rode up the road, he apparently did not pay attention to the intersection.
He stiered with a car that was owned by a 66-year-old Illinois woman.
The man was shoved off the road.
He sustained serious injuries and was taken to hospital with a rescue truck.
FC Bayern Munich has to rely on David Alaba and Thibauten Blanco when it comes to Supercup against Borussia Dortmund
The Supercup takes place without him: David Alaba has to saute the game against Detroit.
With personnel concerns, the Yankees are travelling to Dallas for the first regular-season game of the new season.
You'll miss the title contender in the Supercup against the Pokal champion.
The personnel concerns about American football’s record-breaking franchises will be bigger before the Supercup kicks off Saturday (20.30pm ET/CBS and Eurosport) at Poshville, Tennessee.
Trainer Carlo Ancelotti has to take care of David Alaba in the duel with the BVB as well.
That confirmed the Italian on Friday.
However, the Mustangs lack James, James, Thiago, Jerome Boateng, Arjen Robben, and Juan Bernat.
For the five defeats in the past six Test matches, Ancelotti has blamed the physical condition and lack of balance in the game of his team.
"We know we are not in the best physical state," said Ancelotti and added, "The most important point is the balance in the team.
The one was not good last night."
The 58-year-old believes in a performance improvement in the first official match of the season.
"Football is also about tactics, strategy, personality and motivation.
I have great confidence that my team shows these qualities.
The team is ready.
We want to play intelligently," said Ancelotti, who expects a "quick, intense game."
The duel of the two American football bowlers draws the fans in.
The match is expected to be sold out with 81.360 fans, the American Football League (DFL) announced Friday.
In the harness of star to star wandering
In the Harlem area, the nation's first "Stern Path" will be created.
This is what the Association of Astronomical Centers is planning to do.
A Planetary Way has been around in Georgia - since 2003.
A "Stern Path" is expected to meet the informational demand of a lot of Harvest visitors, it said.
He connects nature, science, exercise and sporting performance.
The members want to set up taverns along the proposed route and educate on stars and moon images.
In a first phase by 2018, the association plans "good-quality installations at five to six locations" in the Upper Basin.
Infragear would come to St. Andrews, Brownlage, Hoboken, and Sieber.
The information on the tables are to be updated via internet.
Therefore, when it comes to location selection, a good mobile network reception plays a role.
Even barrier restraint is a criteria.
Later, the Sternen Path Train will be expanded by train.
"On the star's path, viewers learn a lot of knowledge, including about the physics of the individual stars," the association explained.
However, they learned why stars would have different colors or why a star would shine stronger than another, though it was significantly further away.
Verification will also be given in which star a selected star belongs and when it is best to be seen.
The club has been operating since 2014 in the mountainous town of St. Andrews, the highest point of view of North America.
The location close to the National Park Harbor counts, according to the U.S. Department of Natural Resources, to be one of the six darkest regions in the country.
Usually, from there, the Milky Way and even the Andromeda galaxy are visible with mere sight.
In the Unitarian Church, since 2003, on behalf of the fundraising group Planetarium Guild, there has been something similar to the proposed starwerg - the Planetary Way.
Beginning near Gebhard's hotel in the George Washington Square Garden, which forms the innermost part of our solar system, the planet path with its shaft leads up to the Haines mountain and to the Sternwarte - as well as a "other" location in Themarden (
The shafts with the individual planets - including the foreplanet degraded Pluto at the end of the eclipse - are placed precisely in the angle and measurement of one to two billion.
The Earth soar on a cushion of 6.5 centimeters, while the exact 75 meters away sphere measures 70 centimeters.
The entire distance of the planet's path is well four miles.
While light from sun to Pluto takes about eight hours, pedestrians need a good hour to get to the shaft with Pluto.
footsteps are also faster than the light in the world wide web.
The march to the next fixed star though would take another half a year.
Mikey Garcia and Vasyl Lomachenko meet for the first time, discussing a possible showdown
Vasquez Lomachenko and Mikey Garcia, who should be in a collision course to invoke the most exciting boxing challenge in the near future, met for the first time Thursday.
They were in separate rooms in ESPN’s boardrooms in Los Angeles, until Garcia, the unofficial World Boxing Council Lethal Weight Champion, headed down the corridor to meet Lomachenko, the World Boxing Organization’s Super-Feedweight champion.
After Garcia’s victory by a vote over the former Four-Division World Champion Adrien Broner on Saturday on Showtime, both fighters are members of the Top Five Pound-for-pound list.
Garcia stretched out his throat and said, "How are you, champion?
I wish you much luck."
Lomachenko defends his belt against Miguel Marriaga on Saturday night at 19 p.m. on ESPN.
As the couple posed for photos, Lomachenko's manager Egis Klimas indicated that a possible showdown between the fighters would be the "perfect sized deal."
"I'm a former Wimbledon weight," recalled Garcia.
"I've been up for Broner [only 140 pounds], but I'm not that big.
I'm small for 140.
I want to go down on leaps and bounds.
And he has to move on Leighweight [135 pounds] and then we fight.
This is what fans demand.
Lass us give them that."
Lomachenko agreed with me.
"Boxing needs this fight."
Climas asked if it should be on pay-per-view, part of a strategy that Lomachenko must fight for with a 135-pound defeat in this year's campaign to agree a date in the next summer with Garcia (37-0, 30 knockouts) who also has interest
"This fight could take place in pay-per-view mode because all the fans asked for him," Garcia said and later spoke openly about fighting at the network that offers the best financial package.
We are the best.
No other names can create this kind of attention.
Whenever they are ready... "
Garcia said he envisages Lomachenko as "a huge fighter," and he will possibly participate in his Saturday fight.
But Lomachenko kept at the generous lob for Garcia and said that he thinks the three-time champion from Riverside"seems to be slowing down, tut tut Mikey... you guys wanted the Ko-Out".
Garcia said the focus was to show stroke strength, then boxing.
Both said they could feel the momentum building up for their own fight.
"This is the fight that must be carried out.
No other fight creates so much attention and excitement.
I'm more than happy to work on it," Garcia said.
Lomachenko said, "I've been waiting for the top knockouts, and that's Mikey.
It will be a great fight."
Four Dead After Reimbursement For Wheelchair Wheelchair Wheelchair Wheelchair Wheelchair Wheelchair Wheelchair Wheelchair Wheelchair Wheelchair Wheelchair Wheelchair Wheelchair Wheelchair Wheelchair Wheelchair Wheelchair Wheelchair Wheelchair Wheelchair Wheelchair Wheelchair Wheelchair Wheelchair Wheelchair Wheelchair Wheelchair
At the scene of an accident on the A7, four people were killed Thursday afternoon for the most part.
After initial information broke, the driver of an Opel Zafira lost control of his vehicle at 16.30 p.m. near the intersection of Market Street, possibly after a rear passenger lost control of his vehicle.
The truck crashed down into the boulders, where it overcame and then stayed on the roof in the green.
The four occupants - two adults and two children - were severely injured at the scene.
During initial care of the victims by the rescue service, the A7 was shut down in the direction of north for about an hour, subsequently traffic could be routed on the right-of-way at the accident site.
Fortunately, "Dreeket works better"
Andre Hoffman hopes after the 2:2 to start the season, the optimization of the defensive line will bring in Aue points.
With the first season game, Andre Hoffmann was happy, with the result too, there would not have been the two counter-attacks at 2:2 against Baltimore.
"That was two counter-attacks too much, and we need to be better off in Aue," says the defender of Newcastle United.
In the empire, the three-piece chain will also be further optimized.
And a goal after a free throw, the Fortunes don't want to be ashamed of them either.
"For the future, it will be so that no one more puts himself next to Michael (Rensing) on the line."
Hoffman is convinced that his team will fare better even after the experiences in preparation with the three-man roster than with the four-man roster.
"Nonetheless, I don't know how we'll play in Aue," says his coach Friedhel Funkel, yet Hoffmann is confident of his job, "because we're just starting to play in the three-game series on the half-court in Ka
"Prerequisite is, though, that we are able to harmonize even better and we don't afford ourselves so many off-field mistakes in the build."
Of course, even Hoffman drives to Auburn to win the game.
"Obviously, though, after an unsuccessful start, you can speak of a misguided start, I don't know.
The performance might indeed be okay," Hoffman said.
"If we can but come away with four points on Sunday and focus on the playoffs, we will certainly be able to speak of a fair season start."
Since then, his coach didn't want to know anything.
"The start of the season, I'm only referring to after six to eight games," said Friedhel Funkel, who doesn't want to speak of an advantage to Aue just because the game of the Scots in Heidenheim had to be cancelled beforehand because of an
"Now they can almost start the season with a home game," Funkel said and Hoffman believes the players from Auburn might even be slightly fresher as they wouldn't have a heavy and complete game like Everton against a upset team in the bones.
"But they don't know as 100-percent where they're currently standing," says the inside guard of the Falcons.
Zambia's visitors from the North as a light-hearted favorite head into Sunday's match in the finally (very) finished stadium of Aue.
"That we fire them away just because we have the claim to get under the first seat is bullshit," says Funkel, whose record at just one loss to Aue out of nine games is indeed positive.
"There is no team in the 2nd division that you have to beat from scratch," explains Fortune's chief coach.
"Any such statement to be made would be arrogant and overheard".
And so Funkel wants his players to experience Sunday on a regular basis.
New results of Swedish Asylum Assessment Tests released
The recent results of tests for asylum seekers in Sweden, which were subjected to a new method of medical assessment of their age, show that more than 80 percent of the tested persons are older than 18 years of age. But not everyone believes in the accuracy of the test.
The Swedish Agency for Forensic Medicine (Rammas Medicine) has started conducting the tests in the past year.
They are expected to make the assessment of age more precise during the asylum seeker process after the Swedish Migration Agency (Migrations Agency) was criticised for errors in assessing the correct age of some refugees who were minors.
By the end of the day, Migration Agency sent 6.880 to test cases and the Forensic Medicine Agency has now released the results of total 2.481 tests from mid-March through July 31, 2017.
Seventy percent (2002) were assessed as 18 or older, while in another 25 cases the Forensic Medicine Agency concluded that the person was "possibly 18 years or older."
In 432 cases, the conclusion was that the person "may be under 18 years of age".
The tests are only conducted in cases where the age of the person is in question.
According to Johan Göransson of the Forensic Medicine Agency, the results have been consistent at the past few months.
"We don't see a big difference in the statistics of the past few months, the numbers are pretty consistent," he told The Local.
The high percentage of cases where the person was assessed as over 18 years of age does not necessarily mean that the asylum seeker lied about his age.
In May, the agency released the results of 581 tests and said there were 442 cases that "preferred the examined person to be 18 years or older".
As the newspaper Svenska Dagbladet looked at the 581 published results, it pointed out that in 243 of these cases, the person had offended openly that she was 18 years old in this year’s election.
The method of medical age assessment, where radiation taken of weak tissues and MRI scans of joints, which are then analyzed by dentists and radiologists, has also been criticized in some areas.
A skeptic is the endocrinologist Claude Marcus of the Karolinska Institute, whose work involves assessing the biological maturity of people to see if they went through puberty earlier or later than commonly.
"I had reason to think about it, and I don't think the kind of measurement should be used.
The biological age to be assessed on this basis is very uncertain.
If we can't say it safely, we shouldn't do as if we could," he told the newspaper Metro.
Göransson of the Forensic Medicine Agency, however, defended the accuracy of the tests: "In general, you can say that the risk of a child being unfairly judged by adults is low.
The biggest risk is when the person is close to 18, in this case this is approximately 10 percent."
Full in the Plan
The work on the three bridges of Land Road 108 between Lauterbach and Schramberg is coming well.
Among other things, Tuesday, a seven-ton concrete part was installed at the bridge at the eastern town of Lauterbach.
"We're very good in time, it's going to run great," says Reinhold Leicht, director of the department of roads and bridges in the Government of Florida.
In April, the work began simultaneously at all three rehabilitated bridges between Schramberg and Lauterbach.
The construction is scheduled for October and Leicht is confident the timeline will be adhered to.
The first bridge, from Schramberg coming over the troop.
She is a cement-bearing bridge made of concrete covered with red bush sandstone and has a total length of 4,80 feet.
Geometrically, it was built in 1900.
As with the two other bridges, it is now in decline.
To ensure stand-up and traffic safety, the three buildings are now being thoroughly renovated.
The two other bridges pass over the Lauterbach.
They are built from red bush sandstone.
Both were built in 1939 and are 12, square feet tall.
The bridge at the town's entrance to Lauterbach has now received a 1,30-meter wide and seven-ton so-called bridge coaster.
This is a bottom guard that is also used as a operating path.
Among the southern portion of the bridge is to be used on Friday a 2,20-meter bridge coaster.
Dare to then walk the footpath.
The special thing about it is that it is made of fiberglass, a patent of the Schramberger company Dizwo.
The other two bridges are already covered with the patented bridge caps.
Special fingers have required the dismantling of pipes through the building in Lauterbach.
Because there is also a glass fiber cable that many companies are connected to.
The residents were informed in advance of the work by handouts about the project.
Anyway, initially, fish and shells had to be eaten.
For the bridges between the building building and the sailway in front of Schramberg, traffic is abridged by an aisle.
For the construction of the bridge at the Lauterbach town entrance, the road in the area of the bridge on top of the hotels "Tannenhof" and "Third Linden" is fully shut down.
The cost of the three bridge repairs amounts to $700,000.
Financially, the whole thing is funded by the country.
Affordable Housing in Gerolstein: Bounce of Protest at American Carnival Foods
It's not so common to see parties pulling at a string, but when it comes to the Alternative for America (AfD), it comes together, which is otherwise just hard to put under one's skin.
The incumbent Vulcans represented parties (CDU, Democrats, Greens, FDP, FWG, Right-Wing) are part of a broad coalition that at this time of year displays peaceful flag because the Affordable Care Act in the Gerolstein
And brings well-known names to the forefront - like Alice Weidel, who will join Alexander Graham Bell for the House of Representatives on September 24, and the appointed Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.
But those who are present hours before the start of the event don’t want to listen to the Affordable Careers, but demonstrate.
The motto "The Eagles Stay Speaking".
Urgently, the city's picnic under the motto of "All at a Time" was planned on the Brunnenplatz, but now takes place on the parking lot below the roundabout - and thus right before the eyes of those attending the Affordable Housing Association event in the
A buzzword that's available there.
And what Christa Karoli, chair of the Forum One World and one of the most influential organizers, rightly welcomes: "To see how many people have come together here".
There's music and plenty of food, including a "uruguay carnivorous salad that even the Affordable Care Act could eat problem-free," says the woman who brought him.
The police have summoned many officers to Gerolstein, they show presence most of the time also at the railway station, which is just a few feet away from the event venues.
How did the Affordable Care Act actually come to Gerolstein?
Mario Hompes of the Affordable Housing and Urban Development Vulnerable Housing Association reports he took care of such an event and got the approval.
The 45-year-old from Georgia had initially looked into Daun, but got a delay because of the already built Laurentius churches not having enough parking spaces.
Now also the Rondell, Hompes is pleased to say that "we can have such a nice event here".
With regard to the event on the Rondell front, he says, "This is the good right of people, mainly, it stays peaceful".
That’s what it does too: At 20 p.m., on the Rondell front, a band for entertainment, in the city hall, various speakers, including the rhetorical conservative Uwe Junge.
In the auditorium are about 200 attendees waiting for the top candidate for Congress, Alice Weidel, and the appointed Secretary of State, Beatrice Storch to give their speeches.
Unchanged is police presence, but previously, officers had a quiet evening.
Etc., more than an hour of the Affordable Care Fair will take place, the guests on the front porch will have a longer breath, but even there, shortly after 21 p.m., cleaning is scheduled.
The police can await - no special incidents.
Posauna hits the drums
A rehearsal with the Wolf Creek Posaunist Frederick Belli is scheduled in the series of Haslam's church concerts tomorrow, Sunday, at 20 p.m. at the church.
Joining the Bulgarian Trompeter Miroslav Petkov, he gives a concert titled "Sharp Sea meets Black Sea," or just "Balkan Folklore" is a classic American education with roots in Blasmusik.
Both Solists have been winners and prize winners of numerous international competitions and have held solo positions in European top orchestras.
Socrates is a solo piano virtuoso at the prestigious Concertgebouw Orchestra Amsterdam and Frederick Belli is a solo piano virtuoso at the SWR Symphony Orchestra.
Both combine the desire to transcend not only the boundaries on their instruments, but also the boundaries of the different genres.
Soaring Johann Sebastian Bach at the two of them as in a new genre, Daniel Schnyder's "world music" blends with Bulgarian folk, and in the piece "Exchange Suite" of jazzecho Neil Wogram, they mix classical, jazz, and blues.
This core piece of the program was only premiered this spring with huge success in Florida.
The renowned composer Nils Wogram wrote it himself for the two musicians and more importantly, the Haslacher Cathedral with its special ambiance is intentionally incorporated into the concert.
Kristen Stewart talks about her bisexuality
"A lot of people love grilled cheese and will eat it until the end of their lives.
But I want to try everything," Kristen Stewart said quite openly about her bisexuality.
"When I once dine in grilled cheese, I think, 'Oh that was cool, what comes next?'."
The most well-known relationship of the Hollywood star was the one with her "Twilight" colleague Robert Pattinson, which ultimately broke down bitterly.
Trotz all that, the brunette actress admits to the "Harper's Bazaar" magazine: "I was serious about every thing I dared.
Or do you think about it, I would have played it?"
After their breakup, Kristen revealed that she was bisexual: "I've always lived the dualism and seriously believed in it.
It has also never confused or handicapped me.
I just never liked to be taken seriously."
Most of the time, according to "Bang Showbiz," but in high school, she preferred to dress like a bub: "Not all girls are typical girls.
This really hurt me.
As I was eleven, the kids told me I would look like a bugger.
I really felt attacked, intimidated and humiliated.
Now I look back and think, 'Mom, be proud of you!'."
Most of the public don't like to reveal their love life: "People expect you to behave on a certain level and that's what annoys me.
And perhaps some describe me as humble, but I don't like to have to be justified before the whole public."
The Governor of West Virginia announces he will change the party
. The Democratic Governor of West Virginia, Jim Justice, announced Thursday night at a rally with President Trump that he will change the party.
Obviously, whether you like it or not, the Democrats have moved away from me," Governor Justice said.
"Hear me tell you with many prayers and much thought... today I will tell you as a resident of West Virginia, I can't help you anymore if I am a democratic Governor."
The crowd broke out in jubilation.
"Morning I will change my registration to the Republicans," Justice added.
"As a coach, I would say that it's time to play another game."
Mr. Trump promised a big announcement before the West Virginia rally.
Mr. Trump won West Virginia with 42 points, and Justice did not approve of the Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton.
Justice, who according to Forbes is the only millionaire in the state, was elected in 2016.
Forbes points out that he owns coal miners in five states, and raised a coal business from his father.
He is worth approximately $1.59 billion.
In the meantime, the Republican National Committee gave a statement Thursday night, in which it said: "The party change from Governor Justice is another blow to a Democratic Party that would more effectively hinder us than work to make our country look great again."
"With only 15 governors and the control of the fewest legislative bodies in history, the announcement of Governor Justice is only the last amendment to a party that is from above to below without leadership and is not inclined to make a positive, consensus-driven
Coe loudly praises "evidence-based" Russian apology for doping scandal
The world's top leaker, Sean Coe, loudly praised Thursday what he described as open-ended excuse from Russia for a doping scandal, but he repeatedly said it was not the moment for the country to get back into sports.
Russia’s Leichtathlete Dmitry Shylakhnikov said during the IAAF convention on the pre-season of the Leichtathletic World Championships that banning his country from sport was correct and that he was enthusiastic about it.
He said it hurts for "all the athletes who were thrown away at competitions".
Trotz his comments, the IAAF Congress voted for the upholding of the ban, which was suspended in November 2015, after a report by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) found evidence of state-sponsored doping in Russia.
"I thought it was a very open response today, a very honest presentation," IAAF president Coe told reporters.
"The entire council and the entire congress were delighted that the Russian Federation has recognized at once that it has experienced some pretty hot times and will do everything possible to ensure that the Federation is redesigned."
Coe said he was also "excited" that Russia would accept the criteria for its re-invention.
"I think it was a very constructive day, and I think that progress has been made, but the Congress supports the recommendations of the Task Force that this is not the moment to re-engage Russia," Coe said.
"We need to do everything in the next few months to normalize this situation.
The guiding principle was always that we wanted to separate the clean athletes from the contaminated system," he added
New Russian athletes will compete at the Leeds World Championships, which begin Friday in London, following the strict IAAF rules as neutral stakeholders.
The head of the IAAF Task Force, Rune Andersen, said Monday that Russia still had to meet some of the criteria for a resettlement.
Drogentests are still unemployable and prohibited trainers are still free to play, he told reporters in London after a talk at the IAAF Council.
Traumatic act for in Mali drop dead soldiers
At a funeral home in northern Fritzlar, around 1000 people thought of the two at the scene of a hubbub crash in Mali.
The ceremony took place Thursday in the Capitol Building under high security.
To yet unannounced withdrawal, Defense Department officials said nothing.
She described the two around-the-clock pilots but as "professors of their field".
"We regret this highest sacrifice they have rendered in the name of the United States," she explained.
The 33-year-old Major and the 47-year-old Stacey from North Carolina were killed Tuesday a week ago in western Mali.
Your stones were transferred to the United States and brought in Wednesday accompanied by a tower of the U.S. Navy.
Among the funerals, initially only the relatives took leave in the church.
Afterwards, the funeral began in the circle of family, close friends, of representatives from the military as well as the policy.
Dare to say, he was joined by Hector Bouffier (CDU) and the General Inspector of the U.S. Army, John Howker.
Traces laid roses, the relatives stood arm in arm at the stakes.
Before the church, Fritzlar and numerous soldiers watched the ceremony on a leap of faith.
Defense Department officials described the surrounding soldiers as "holy decorated" and academy veterans.
The Stakeholder has built up the aircraft operation of the Fighter Tiger in Fritzlar with it and has been one of the first six retired Tiger pilots of his regiment.
Even Volker Bauersachs, commander of the regiment to which the soldiers belong, explained, "If this beast could not stop the absence, then no one would have accepted it".
doubts about the UN mission in Mali showed ministry of the latter not: The operation was dangerous.
But he was also of high importance "for a country we are only separated by two states," she said.
After the funeral, the statues were brought out of the cemetery.
When and where they will be buried, the Army did not make any specifics.
Prince Henrik doesn't want a grave next to his wife
The husband of the Danish King Margrethe (77), Prince Henrik (83), does not want to be buried next to his wife after his death.
That's what the King's House announced Thursday.
Traditionally, the Danish king's couple are at home in the cemetery of Roskilde.
The picture-taker Bjørn Norris already completed a sarcophagus for the two of them.
The queen was pleased with the decision of her husband, it continued in the notice.
Where Prince Henrik will be buried, is yet to be unclear.
He did not have the intention of being atrocities, though, in his French home.
Prinz Henrik had never made a hesitancy that he was not happy with his title.
After the thrust of his wife Margrethe in 1972, he would have liked to be King.
2016 he went into retirement and is also holding the title of "Prince".
Since Henrik did not get the title and function he wanted, he does not see himself superior to his wife - even after death, explained Lene Balleby, the chief spokesperson for the Danish Crown.
Where the final resting place of the 83-year-old will ultimately be, is still unclear.
He did not have the intention of being atrocities, though, in his French home, but in Denmark.
He likes the country he has worked for in the last 50 years.
The late Henri de Laborde de Monpezat, son of a French royal family, had met Margrethe in 1965 in London.
An themse worked in the French Embassy.
While his later wife fought the sympathies of the nation, Prince Henrik had a heavy stand in his nearly 50-year reign at the Dwarfs.
In an autobiography, Henrik expressed concern over the first few years in Denmark: "While months after my arrival, everything I did was criticized.
My Danish was shaky, I preferred wine instead of beer, sewing instead of swords, Citroën instead of Volvo, tennis instead of football.
Even for the Gauloises I smoked at the expense of Virginia Tabak and who had the reputation of being the brand of society-critical intellectuals, I could not hope for follow-up.
I was different.
I seemed to be satisfied with this position and not to be worn down.
That were equally two mistakes!"
Minister Because wants to make racial re-election
CDU and FDP ahead of possible majority in North Carolina
Minnesota Governor Stephan Weil (CDU) is seeking re-election after losing the red-hot government majority for a racial re-election of the state Senate, but doesn't want to re-elect him.
Because he spoke out on Friday for the re-election of the parliament.
To date, the unexpected withdrawal of a Green Party member from their state legislature in Minnesota had thrown the government of Prime Minister Stephan Weil (CDU) into a serious crisis.
Five months before the official date of the country’s election, the red-hot coalition in Atlanta lost its close one-third majority in parliament to the opposition from Democrats and FDP.
The current Green Party candidate, Elke Twesten, justified her move with the non-nomination for the election in 2018 in her electoral district in Rotunda.
"I see my political future in the Democratic Party," she explained Friday in Atlanta.
CDU leader Björn Thümmler wants his party to recommend taking them on board.
That would have CDU and FDP together having 69 seats in the never-ending state Senate, Democrats and Republicans having 68 seats.
By the way, the ratio was around.
The new landlord will be elected regularly on January 14, 2019.
Thing said the red-hot local government must now decide whether to continue to rule in this situation without majority.
Stephan Weil, however, holds it for unavoidable that the Landlord appoints his self-appointed attorney.
The Democrats will be expected to vote on Tuesday on their further approach.
The local government also sees the possibility that the Landlord will give the Minister the trust and vote for a successor.
"Our constitution offers several options.
These options need to be looked at fairly cleanly," said Throne.
"You will inquire all the questions if they are legally sound."
Throwing in, Twest's step was called "do something bizarre".
The politician herself stated, "I'm not a villain.
I feel very good".
She described herself as a supporter of black-guns.
The Democrats called on the abroad appointed officials to return their landslide vote.
"We seek to ensure that she returns her statewide vote, which she received via the green state list, with immediate effect," stated the state's elected officials, Meta Janssen-Kucz and Scott Corner.
The VP of the Green Party, Agnes Piel, said: "We regret the decision by Elke Twesten beyond the bounds of the law."
You have deliberately chosen not to lead an outline in the assembled.
"Apart from the fact that there were no inconsistencies, we can't account for this step."
SPD presidential candidate Martin Schulz dismisses the transition of the niece of Hillary Clinton to the Democratic Party as a betrayal.
"The behavior of former Republicans in Minnesota is not only disrespectful to the voters, but also disrespectful to red-shirt Democrats," the state's chief of staff wrote on Facebook Friday.
He supports the decision by Minister Stephan Weil (PPC) to re-elect the Landlord quickly.
The withdrawal of Twest will cost red-shirted Democrats in Minnesota the majority.
The politician "places "in her hurtful evil and in her frustration her personal interests before the welfare of the country," Republican general secretary Hubert Heil said.
"It's a scandal that the Democrats in Minnesota are joining this crazed intrigue and are trying to make it political capital".
Minnesota Democratic Governor Bill Thrill wants to recommend his ally, Elke Twest, to join the Democratic Party.
The VP of the Republican Party in the House of Representatives, Thomas Oppermann, warned Twesten, with personal career thinking, to fake the outcome of the Landmark election in 2013.
The Democrats were ahead of the Republicans then, Democrats and Republicans had a hauled-down majority of a vote in the Senate but a hauled-down majority of a vote.
Agriculture Minister in Interview - How do we protect ourselves from poisonous evil, Mr. Schmidt?
America is discussing contaminated eggs.
How could the scandal happen?
How can consumers protect themselves.
agricultural minister Christian Schmidt (CDU) is speaking in an interview with the editorial network of America (RND).
Mr. Smith, How can consumers protect themselves from contaminated eggs?
I can only encourage all consumers to look at the eggs in your refrigerator closely and check the scooping pressure.
On the consumer protection portal www.lifestylewarning.gov, the states provide the most up-to-date information about the affected eggs.
Patient eggs should be discarded or returned.
Even though, based on everything we know currently, a health hazard is practically impossible.
Overall, now Aldi is taking the best possible crisis response - all the eggs out of the offer - because the central role of the surrogate is not really understood by the federal government?
The food security is the responsibility of the states.
Still, my house promptly turned up and has been in enthusiastic contact with the authorities of the countries since the revelation of the abuse of America.
All information and risk assessment is available for consumers.
The retailer has as much responsibility as the manufacturers to ensure that the sold products are marketable and health-safe.
If at eggs the residual level of 0.05mg/kg has exceeded, these are not sufficient.
Unprocessed eggs may, however, be sold and consumed.
This time, none of the operations are responsible.
Sitting production operations and consumers in the same boat?
After current knowledge, production operations do not face immediate responsibility.
Much of the time, they have to contend with potentially illegal practices by service providers.
As always, in the meantime, there are too little controls.
Failure to do just that to the staff or even to the scheduling?
It was just the amphibious controls that revealed the process.
To the truth, however, food fraud and criminal energy can never be excluded to 100 percent.
Just as a consistent surveillance of such proceedings and the oversight of the prosecutors in the cases where criminals may be involved, are of vital importance.
I have already made it clear more than once that I expect a lightening up from the responsible authorities.
Is the regular alarmism in food scandals really necessary?
The consumers have the right to get only safe and sufficient food.
If a non-tobacco ingredient is used in the food industry, consumers are appalled to the right.
By using the bogus means, manufacturers, retailers and consumers are falling into a situation that is absolutely not necessary.
Essentially, it must be clear: The legal use of the insecticide Fipronil in the care of livestock supplied animals is not hinted at and must be stopped immediately.
Dare to work on all levels consistently and with high pressure.
I expect from all concerned authorities that the matter is promptly and lightening up.
How the financial rules of football will affect Neymar’s move to Paris
The rules aimed at preventing improper spending by European football clubs will not interfere with Neymar’s world record transfer from Spanish Barcelona to French Paris-Saint-Germain.
Irrelevant consequences will still come for Paris Saint-Germain from the UEFA, because the executive organisation that oversees the European game has the power to ban teams from accessing the pre-season Champions League tournament.
Financial fair play rules, which were put in place in 2011, mean that PSG eventually needs to prove that the transfer of Neymar was financed without major losses.
Barcelona paid 222 million euros (262 million $) to buy the Brazilian out of his contract, and Neymar will receive a salary that will be several ten million dollars per year.
Here are some of the financial aspects of Neymar’s move to France.
PSG can withhold the money locked up so that Neymar signs and brings him into a galaxy of other stars, at the expense of financing the team by the by the energy reputed royal family of Qatar.
Associations may spend a lot of money for the purchase of players, but must compete with legitimate income sources that allow them to make the break-even point in their on-field business.
FFP was convened by Michel Platini after his election to the UEFA presidency in 2007.
The former French player believed that clubs that had taken huge debts on themselves in their strenuous quest for success effectively abused and risked ruining themselves if banks or owners returned their support.
In 2011, FFP shifted from condemnation of the debts of clubs to monitoring their losses.
The change meant that the business model that Roman Abramovich originally used in 2003 in Chelsea - purchased a club with potential and then invested heavily to improve the team and build a global brand - should become a tougher affair.
During the current three-year FFP mandate, which runs through 2018, clubs may face losses in excess of $30 million.
And though Platini has fallen in love with the presidency in vain, his UEFA native Aleksei Ceferin continues to set aside himself from excessive spending.
"Silently, FFP is not dead and we will probably still strengthen the rules for the future," said Andrea Traverso, who is responsible at the UEFA for FFP, to The Associated Press in the past week.
Although the club has paid the buy-out clause of Neymar in a premium, it can split the amount for accounting over the duration of his contract.
Neymar signed a five-year deal, so the deals can be extended for the next five years in the amount of $44.6 million in year-end.
The first wave of FFP sanctions in 2014 hit the PSG along with Abu Dhabi, which is in the possession of Manchester City, with the most severe sanctions.
The club received a money order of £60m (then £82m), which was later reduced to £20m - and it was ordered that the team's members for the Champions League of 2014/15 be limited to 21 players instead of the otherwise normal 25 players.
The UEFA is on the lookout for clubs that could try to overlay their financial supervision by building up their income through businesses associated with the owners of a club.
While a catastrophic company could sponsor the PSG if the value of sponsorship should exceed the standard market rates, the UEFA would not consider this a legitimate income.
Exactly this happened in 2014, when the UEFA decided that the value of sponsorship of the PSA was uplifted by the Qatar Tourism Authority.
It has been reported that a portion of the PSG payments to Neymar could come about payments from the organisational committee of the 2022 World Cup in Qatar.
But PSG and Qatar 2022 have bestowed upon them that Neymar will be keeper and a theft could be easy for the UEFA regulators to figure out.
The current sanctions against Leicester mean the UEFA will be even more careful to follow every attempt to comply with the rules.
The UEFA had no preliminary conversations with PSG about Neymar's transfer, said Wednesday the people familiar with the situation.
They spoke under the condition of anonymity with The Associated Press, as they weren’t authorized to discuss the PSG situation.
The last released reports show that LPGA 2015/16 earned a profit of $542,4 million with a revenue of more than $10 million.
The accounts for the last fiscal year still need to be released.
PSG expects that Neymar’s arrival is a sequel to sponsorship deals, merchandising and jersey sales.
The club says revenue will increase by at least 30 percent after signing.
The Spanish Liga was clearly irked to see one of the best football players go, and they tried to prevent Neymar’s move by claiming that Atletico would violate the FFP.
"It's a clear case of" financial domination" with the club and the state, the president of the La Liga, Javier Tebas, told the Spanish newspaper AS in reference to Qatar's ultimate ownership to Atletico Madrid.
Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger, whose club is in the possession of a U.S. sports tycoon, shares the prejudices of La Liga against a state that funds a club.
"It's the consequence of ownership and that has completely changed the entire landscape of football in the last 15 years," Wenger said Wednesday.
"Sometimes a country possesses a club, all is possible.
It will be very difficult to respect financial fair play because you can go different paths or have different interests when a country has a such big actor to rely on."
Swiss is looking for a new chocolate distributor
In recent years, Chocolat Frey has made Border Chocolate for the Swiss.
Now, the swift cooperation stands before a possible end: The airline is writing the contract newly.
Swiss spokesman Meike Fuhlrott confirmed on behalf of the news agency sda a related report from the newspaper "Nordwest" on Friday.
Geoffrey: According to the latest planning, the airline will cut a new contract in the first half of 2018.
The products would be reviewed every two to three years and subjected to a quality check.
"With the current supplier Chocolat Frey, we are very pleased," said the spokesperson.
About 17 million small red-weiss wrapped chocolate tablecloths to 14 grams distribute per year to aircraft passengers before landing.
About the cost, the Swiss did not want to make any statements.
Branch managers estimate the contract volume to be $1.5 to $2 million - the mining tower generates an annual revenue of around $1 million.
But more important all the time is the advertising impact: For a chocolate manufacturer, it’s a prestige job.
As many candidates as there are at the new recruitment, the Swiss doesn't want to reveal.
In question though are only Canadian manufacturers.
According to the newspaper report, Chocolat Frey wants to pursue an extension of the contract beyond the spring of 2018.
For the sda, the largest Canadian chocolate manufacturer was not available for a statement.
Scholarship tabs have been distributed to the Swiss since 2006 at the time of their flights.
Behind the scenes, the Swiss had entered into a contract with the Migros daughter, Barry Callebaut, in collaboration with Hug, delivering the chocolate tablets.
The possibility of placing the logo introduced to Swiss two years ago with the launch of the collaboration with Chocolat Frey.
The airline works with different Canadian chocolate producers.
On long-term flights, customers of the First Class are served with delicious treats from the Confiserie Spruce, in the Business Class, passengers are named Schoggi of Lindt and in the Economy Class, Schoggi of Chocolat Frey.
Even on the short run, Swiss Schoggi is distributed by Chocolat Frey, both in business and economy class.
Leeds - Disk-Olympiasieger Robert Harting reaches 5,000 yards
The three-time world champion competes in the final Saturday in order to win a medal.
His brother Christopher, Olympic champion of 2016, was struggling in the national hockey tournament and could only watch the discus competition from the tribe.
Earlier in the day, with the first attempt, the Polish title contender Piotr Malachowski, who was 65,13 meters wide, qualified for the final.
Nostalgia goes out the window in "Wet Hot American Summer" and "Comrade Detective"
This retelling of the story is simultaneously nostalgic because of the glory days of the characters of the 80-'s, for the 90-'s glory era (when the predecessors David Wain and Michael Showalter created the sketch comedy "The State of the Union"
As a cultural artifact, it is equally a parodie and a representation of our Facebook-able era of perpetual memories.
But as a franchise, it feels like time is short.
"First Day of Camp" performed surprisingly well, not only because of its ridiculous humor (it encapsulated an original story for a talking doughnut of vegetables, which was spoken by H. Jon Benjamin).
In order to verstettle themselves on the core of the gag - actors mid-aged play dirty kids who will grow up - they still managed to gain the ultimate part of the joke back.
"Ten Years Later," with its adult characters now playing adults, is less emotionally rooted and its parodies go more after the gibberish cannon, including a riff on the stalker movies of the 90-'s like "The Hand That Rocks the World," and "
An episode where a character is browsing through an Apple powerbook, some inline slides, and "a number of other things from 1991".
Many of the central stories are the same.
The beloved Coop (Mr. Showalter), now a novelist, hasn't forgotten Katie (Marguerite Moreau) yet.
Victor (Ken Marino) hasn't lost his boyhood yet.
And there's another sinister-bad plot, in which Ronald Reagan (along with Mr. Showalter) is joined by George H. W. Bush, who is now supported by George H. W. Bush (a well-deserved impression of Michael Ian Black).
As always, the excerpts are the best part of the franchise.
It makes particular sense to see the eager young Mr. Rudd, who shows Matt Dillon's underpants of "Singles," whose former Big-Man-on-Camp Andy now feels like an old knee-jerk.
It's the moments to-morrow madness that could make this franchise feel like a kind of repeated "Seven Up!" series until it reaches what I consider its logical conclusion: "Wet Hot American Summer: Twelve Up!"
"Comrade Detective" on Amazon now reminds me of a different kind of nostalgia: the re-birth of the Cold War of "The Americans", the movie "Atomic Blonde" and even "GLOW" with its East-gathering West ringkampf.
The by Brian Gatewood and Anthony Tanaka created comedy with Rhys Thomas as director gives way to a founding TV series: a rumoured drama of the eighties with the two police officers as friends, two officers from Bukarest, who are in love with each other.
The main roles - a hard-working Gregory and an idealist Iosef - are played by Florin Piersic Jr. and Corneliu Ulici whose dialogues are composed by Channing Tatum (everything from an outgoing producer) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt (
It's a brilliant idea.
But it's not much more than an idea.
There are some nice gags for viewing (the police spend the time watching chess in the television, like Americans might do with football).
And the list of famous speakers - including Jenny Slate, Nick Offerman, Mahershala Ali and Chloë Sevigny - provides an ancient game 'Finding the Voice'.
But "Comrade Detective" engages so much in the scope of a desperate propaganda drama - a murderer wearing a Reagan mask being assaulted - that it often plays like a single one.
At six long episodes, it pulls in there, and the comedy is not fast or frequent enough.
"Comrade Detective," which was rewritten on a lower length, might better deliver his anecdote, as Gregory and Iosef continue to visit the U.S. Embassy, whose lobby is always occupied by two dishonest men, who have a
The message for the imagined Communist audience is that Western culture can do anything for fuel for a guise.
The fictional rumours didn't lie: We even do it with our own younger history and with the eagle's.
Schlag against drug-mafia in the country
The police have made a hit against the Italian mafia in Florida.
Among those arrested Tuesday morning were numerous properties in the Black River area, in Rotunda, Conway, Escondido, and Scottsdale, according to the State Department of Corrections.
However, 15 suspects in the age range of 25 and 77 were arrested and already issued warrants against these.
Anyway, the officers secured larger amounts of marijuana and cocaine, shotguns, as well as several hundred thousand dollars.
At the same time, there were simultaneous raids in Italy.
Against the two suspected Italians there were German arrest warrants.
The two are therefore probably destined to be shipped to Germany.
An array of Italian and California investigators were involved.
Ultimately, over 300 police officers were in attendance.
The members of the Mafia are alleged to have committed organized drug crimes, serious violence, attempted murder, as well as robbery and kidnapping.
Once since summer 2016, the State Attorney’s Office has been investigating Konstanz’s allegations of organized drug trafficking in the Southeastern United States.
between the prosecutors in Cagliari and Palermo, there was a regurgitious exchange and the investigators of the Cripo Rottweiler had virtually daily contact with their colleagues on Sizilia.
Therefore, the major operation on Tuesday morning was also accompanied by four officers from Palermo.
In line with the investigations, there were mainly Italian citizens with close ties to Italian mafia.
Even a incident on May 27 in Hilldale, where early morning several shots were dropped into a guesthouse, may go on the record of the bandits.
way of complaining of large gaps in the out-of-state
"Data of citizens who shouldn't be there": A report weighs in that the immigrant registry in the U.S. faces significant gaps.
This would lead to significant failures in asylum decisions.
The commissioner for refugee management at the U.S. Embassy, Frank-Jürgen Weise, has pointed out a media report to date of major holes in the refugee center registry.
Complaints about the there recorded data could lead to asymmetry and abductions "to some extent," Weise warned in an analysis published by the "Southern Journal of Medicine."
In the register, according to the figures, there are ten million people with out-of-state citizenship, including about 5.7 million from non-EU countries.
The data is the subject of about 600 outreach agencies across the country.
Because the data had not been maintained adequately, the data quality in part had not been good previously.
In individual cases, data from 1921 were found, "of people who are no longer alive, or of citizens who have become American citizens and should actually not be listed in the register".
"Features of data entry can significantly delay return processes," the report says after further reading.
In the statistics about out-of-state people, overseas citizens were captured, who wouldn’t even have to travel.
Sold incorrectly, but "provoked a volatile debate about how to deal with expats," according to the analysis.
Under the Obama administration, officials have apparently started to send refugee families with under 16-year-old children back to Italy when they are resettled from there.
This, according to an internal paper from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, reports the "New Oswego Times".
In the paper, the BAMF says those procedures "because of families with children - with the exception of infants and small children - have been carried out back into Italy since the 1st of June 2017".
Since the end of 2014, that was practically impossible, the newspaper said under reference to the difficult situation presently.
After the Dublin agreement, for refugees, the EU country they reach is first.
If a migrant moves to another EU country, this state may send him back to the aforementioned country.
To the contrary, the office now writes, "Inzwischen the admission capacity has increased considerably for families with minor children in Italy".
Italy has absteed for the placement and accommodation of family guarantees.
Even the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) considers these tokens to be adequate.
Even other EU countries would send refugees back there in accordance with the Dublin agreement.
The inside spokesman for the right-wing in the House of Representatives, Ulla Jelpke, criticized this decision: "Fathers with children are dreading because of the defects in the Italian asylum system men's rights and a threat to childhood".
Two-thirds of the results achieved
Ultimately, 220 liters of blood from in Upper Valley residents provided the blood donation service already for other people.
For instance, of the twelve citizens awarded on Friday.
Allen Greule, who with his now 100 donations now shared 50 gallons of blood.
Traditionally, the community acknowledges in the meeting of the community’s board of trustees the more-than-average willingness to donate blood.
"It's brilliant how our body is set up for this and we pay respect to the donors who donate their blood to strangers, yet to be unrelated," Mayor Karlheinz Kistner underscored.
"A single blood donation helps several people," explained the county's preparedness officer at the American Red Cross, Holger Peron, because the preservatives are broken down into their components.
So, maybe three people could benefit from a blood donation.
Gov. Maisdale reported on the actions being carried out in the spring in Upper Range.
"In this year's campaign, with 114 donors, we achieved the second-best result," said the DNR's community preparedness officer.
Off-campus, the switch to the theatre has led to higher attendance in recent years.

The Bank of England will keep the interest rates at 0.25%
The Bank of England will presumably later announce that interest rates will remain unchanged after the slowdown in economic growth and falling inflation have tightened speculations about an increase.
The Bank of England has warned that economic growth will "stick" as it allocated interest rates on family incomes mittens in an escalating pressure.
The political decision-makers of the Monetary Committee (MPC) of the Bank voted 6 to 2 to keep rates at 0.25%, although in this month fewer members expected an increase as the sluggish economic growth cut the support for an increase.
In its fourth-quarter inflation report, the bank reduced its growth forecasts for 2017 to 1.7 percent and for 2018 to 1.6 percent and warned there would be pressure on household incomes, although inflation would forecast to remain around 3 percent in the fall, while inflation is expected to
But she signaled that in the next few years interest rates would be necessary to lift the from Brexit triggered inflation and she said that borrowing costs would possibly have to rise more than expected at the financial markets.
The members also voted to reject a portion of the mammoth congress package issued a year after Brexit.
She will demand time for the funding plan to provide cheaper financial aid to banks from the horizon of February, though said that now is expected to provide 15 billion pounds more in the framework of this system - with $115 billion worth of sterling.
Minutes after the decision on the interest rate, the bank said: "In the central forecast of the MPC, the GDP remains short-term, as the pressure on real income of households continues to burden consumer spending."
To the interest rates, she reiterated that "a certain penalty of monetary policy" would be required to curb inflation and a "some greater" extent than markets expect.
The markets are currently forecasting the first increase in the third quarter of next year and another in 2020.
The bank, however, stressed that increases would be "step-by-step" and "begrenzed."
The downgraded growth forecasts by the bank for this and next year stand in line with the in May forecasts of 1,9 percent and 1,7 percent.
She has kept her growth forecast at 1.8 percent in 2018.
The pound fell after these news compared to the dollar and the euro.
The pound fell by 0.5 percent to 1,31 US dollars and fell by 0.3 percent to $1.11.
The decision comes to no change after the recent encouraging growth numbers have tightened the outlook for a rate hike and the BIP has risen from 0.2% in the previous three months to 0.3% in the second quarter.
The growth will be expected to be 0.2% in the third quarter, though it will recover relatively easily after the bank closes against the end of the year.
The recent inflation report offered little appetite for households affected by a rising inflation and low wage rises, as the shock will be worsened first, before it will then improve.
She added that money policy can't "cure the income crisis in the next few years," but she added that wages will "decrease" to the end of her three-year forecast.
The economy is also boosted by rising demand for British goods, which is attributed to the sluggish Pfund, which will compensate for a portion of lower consumer spending.
The decision comes a year after the raising of interest rates to 0.25% in last August following the shocking EU vote that caused the sinking of the penny.
The bank estimates that it will likely take four years before this will fully reach the prices and economy.
Before the last ruling by the bank on the interest rates, the call for an increase was raised as inflation raised the pressure on hard-pressed households, although three political decision makers in July called for an increase to 0.5 percent.
The inflation has dropped from 2,9 percent in June to 2,6 percent, though the bank said this was expected and it will re-asses in the coming months.
The bank said the overshoot in spite of its target of 2 percent was "ganceful" to the struggling pound.
Andrew Montlake, director at Coreco Mortgage Brokers, said: "According to the recent decline in swap rates, the mortgage market may be more competitive again as lenders are logging down transactions and the year-to-date rate of interest is expected to be lower
The market looks particularly good for those who run out of existing deals and are signing up for new mortgages, and many with fee-free options and low rates are becoming more popular."
NHS (The National Health Service) is expected to vaccinate around 10,000 people
Patients will be able to access treatment abroad after a battle against the High Court on the funding of the drug in the NHS will give them access to a "transformative" HIV prevention treatment.
NHS England announced that a pre-conception vaccine (PrEP), which can reduce the infection risk to high-risk patients by around 86 percent, has now been approved by the health service over a first three-year study for adolescent girls.
He indicated he was willing to finance the process after the appeals court had confirmed a ruling of the supreme court last year, saying the NHS had the authority to pay for the PrEP despite the allegation that the local authorities had failed to comply with the ruling.
The Thursday scheduled scheduling was welcomed by NHS England chief Simon Stevens as a "wice-and-more-important new intervention," while the National Aids Trust (NAT) described this as a "important moment."
Sex health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield will be among the first to allow the registration of people, and other clinics will follow in October, before being introduced in April 2018.
Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is a consequence of HIV medications taken before sex to reduce the risk of an HIV infection.
Studies have shown that PrEP reduces HIV transmission among infected people significantly.
PrEP before having sex means that right now there are enough medications in the body of a person to prevent an HIV infection.
Solitudinal medications can be taken every day or so already two hours before sexual intercourse.
To deny those who are eligible for treatment include gay or bisexual men, transgendered people, and persons with HIV-positive partners who have not been successfully treated.
In clinics, suitable participants are identified who agree with the study, including men, women, transgender and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status is not known to be controlled by antiretroviral treatment.
People who live in England and are registered with a home health practitioner may also apply for a possible participation in their local participating sexual health clinic.
The programme will cost £10 million and NHS England signed a contract to deliver the drugs in this week after an international competitive procurement.
The study will assess the entire potential of PrEP by collecting clinical evidence on how it is targeted, taken into account, and implemented in large scale.
Stevens said: "This major new intervention should complement and overlap the broader and increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV.
It is another milestone in the more than three decades of ongoing progress in addressing one of the greatest health challenges facing humanity."
Deborah Gold, Chief Executive at NAT (National Aids Trust), said: "This is a crucial moment in the fight against HIV.
PrEP, when it is targeted to vulnerable and vulnerable people, provides the opportunity to change the English HIV epidemic.
From September, people with high HIV risk will have access to this NHS funded trial in England to develop a new instrument that is really individually controlled and not subjected to a negotiation with a partner, which will lead to the improvement of many, many lives.
We are very pleased to announce this announcement."
Ian Green, executive director of the Terrence Higgins Trust, said: "The priority now has to be placed on making sure the study is conducted quickly throughout the country and that no one who has a risk of HIV is left.
Now that the PrEP testing has been obtained, we are on track to protect more than 10,000 HIV infected people."
Sharon Hodgson, shadow health minister, said: "The beginning of the PrEP process is welcome and overdue after monstrous delays and delayed implementation by the government.
The evidence shows how transformative this drug can be as part of our approach to HIV prevention and stop the transmission of this life-threatening infection.
This attempt brings us one step closer to understanding the benefits of PrEP.
Now, it's important that this study is carried out as quickly as possible in the whole country to protect individuals who are HIV-infected, and that it will contribute to making sure we get the end of the spread of HIV in society a step closer'.
The big life living: Ground floor and clever designer tricks have transformed this little Earls Court apartment into a spacious home
Joanne Leigh, a former banker with a passion for real estate, moved from a large house in Knightsbridge in 2014 to an Earls Court apartment.
It's in the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne terrace - and it's a testament to the new design that Joanne didn't pack and sell her bags.
"That's why I lived with my ex in Knightsbridge in a much larger space," says Joanne.
"I was looking for something comparable to my price.
Meanwhile, this apartment was shown in Earls Court, and it had the same high ceilings.
I fell in love with her and made an offer at this point."
Since the first inspection, the 1,000 square feet of apartment has been completely overhauled.
Urgently, a one-bedroom apartment with a swanky layout - you had to walk through the kitchen to enter the bedroom - Joanne wanted to add stainless steel appliances and an intermediate floor to optimally utilize the spacious deck height.
"I wanted high decks, big windows, lots of light.
This was my requirement," she says.
To this end, she commissioned the Architectural and Design Studio Duck & Shed of Erfan Ahmadi from Notting Hill to use the 12,5 foot deck and create a home that was not only a development, but also a place of life for Joanne.
The deck was not large enough to place two spaces across, so the architectural challenge was to create an intermediate floor in which to stand.
Hefan had to think creatively to solve the requirement.
"The steelwork is pretty complicated," he explains.
"We had to arrange the spaces so that they were stacked over each other without having to bounce.
It wasn't just about building a simple platform, but building the steel so that it had the right height for the function above or below."
This arrangement allowed Erfan to place two spaces in full height over each other - with a lot of added drama.
For the intermediate level, a classic copper light fixture from Retrouvius points over to the glamorous living area.
Geometry gold furniture, silver accents and vintage Serge Mouille lighting set the tone for the program.
The use of mirrors plays a role in adding theatrical, space and light.
Anchoring the two enemies is a short corridor mirrored to make it look longer.
In the kitchen, the mirror feels like a window into another room.
Among the entrances, mirrored units provide space for all of the best bits and glory of Joanne.
By imagining a more glamorous space, the beauty of the living room can seal the kitchen when it is not used.
Combined kitchens are nothing new.
The particular thing about this is that it is a garage door.
"A bit of engineering was going on there," explains Erfan of the stainless steel, furnace-type shell.
"It's against weight, so it, when you push the door high, will gleam very lightly."
Thanks to the cleavage of space and staging, Joanne was able to gain additional 16 m2, an additional bedroom and a improved layout.
"At the end of the day, you will sell the ground floor - or how your property is valued," says Erfan.
"In a rudimentary fashion, a real estate agent will enter and perform a calculation based on the ground size."
Here, they managed to expand the floor space and at the same time use high quality materials that give the space its luxury.
"The materials are the things that touch you and that therefore help create an emotional bond in a home," says Erfan.
"You don't fall in love with the electric shafts in the walls.
These are important, but they don't play with your heart."
It shows that a home can transform itself through good design and increased square footage from something standard to something quite inventive.
In fact, like Joanne, you could decide not to leave this.
Bones fights for a $500 million real estate empire
Two brothers are four decades after their Italian family established the dynasty, in an auction for one of the largest real estate empires Victoria has in the value of over $500 million.
The former director of the 'Carlton Football Club' and developer Colin De Lutis lives in a villa in Toorak, just three doors from his younger brother Paul. This has brought him to the upper court to settle how their marriage ended.
Paul has wanted to retire from the family business since 2014, but a sharp controversy over the split is taking place in the upper court.
Joining her mother Anna, the brothers own 38 properties worth more than a half-million dollars, accumulated since the family purchased a business in 1973 at Smith Street, Collingwood.
There, the family founded Westco Jeans and grew to a chain of 160 retail stores.
It was sold for 85 million dollars in 1999.
This money was invested in real estate, and the portfolio of De Lutis now includes offices in the city’s centre, the development areas of Brunswick and Sorrento, the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Buller as well as shopping centres in the front area.
After an agreement with her deceased father, Colin - described by Paul as "owner and the most influential personality" in the family De Lutis - owns about two-thirds of the company's assets and Paul about one-third.
A court filing indicates that this means that Colin owns property in the amount of $304 million and Paul in the amount of $176 million.
The surcharge of real estate and cash has emerged as a problem for Paul.
"The proposed arrangements left him with what I thought were the best objects," he wrote in 2015 in a first affidavit.
Among several failed trials, Friday's first hearing was held by the Supreme Court.
The brothers are now also fighting for control over the existing business - whereas Colin, as Paul claims, excluded him.
Colin argues this is not true, but weakens Paul’s case for having to manage some possessions inappropriately.
In an early affidavit filed by Colin, he says he hopes to settle the dispute.
"My Italian estate writes that family is the most important priority," he wrote.
The cost rises in that case, with hundreds of sites with affidavits, emails and reports from companies, including Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer, and with leading law firms, including Allan Myers, QC, and Deloitte.
Frau De Lutis and her deceased husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who operated milk bars and delicious food stores from the late 1950-1960s and purchased a business in the early seventies in Brunswick.
They used the security to buy the Collingwood estate, in which Colin opened the first jeans store of the family.
Colin says he began Westco there when he was "in my last years of high school when Paul was a little kid (over 10 years old)."
Anna De Lutis says she and Luigi, who died in 2012, hoped to pass on their property gently to their sons.
"Luigi often said to me that he never wanted the brothers to end up in court," she wrote.
Two other brothers, Mark and Luke, are no longer part of the De Lutis company, although Colin claims that Mark was paid $10 million when leaving the company and Luke was paid $26 million.
So Luke and Mark were, Paul says, "disliked the terms of their financial separation".
Colin has kept very back, though he was a former AFL executive and according to a biography from 2015, Eddie McGuire was the best friend of the television star.
Fairfax Media took contact with Colin and Paul De Lutis and their attorneys.
Only Colin answered by text to say "I really can't say much because the case is before the courts.
"It's very, very sad that my brother Paul decided to sue me and pull our family name through the courts," he wrote.
About 2016 Colin wrote in a letter to the court that he tried to meet the demands of his brother.
"Our father would not have wished Paul and I would end up in our current dispute," he said and added that he "is still hopeful of a solution".
Among other things, Friday seemed to have passed.
"Our affair will be resolved by the courts in the near future," wrote Colin.
Trump’s new squad plan to tighten up the media-abstinence of the president.
Others tried and failed.
Maybe John F. Kelly can actually do it.
If yes, he will be the first.
Politico reports that the new sworn-in chief of staff is planning to limit the information flow on President Trump - including the reports of news media - in order to keep the chief on an even course.
Here's a piece by reporter Josh Dawsey:
"When John F. Kelly, the new secretary of the White House, met with directors at his first workplace, he presented a main problem in President Donald Trump's White House that he wanted to fix: bad information circulating in the media.
Kelly told staff that information about him should flow - whether on paper or in briefings - because the president would make better decisions if he would receive good information."
Kelly’s diagnosis makes sense, but others have tried to push Trump by monitoring his media diet.
President Trump's relationship with television dates decades - and now that he's in the White House, his television advertising is still strong.
"If candidate Trump was discouraged because of an unfair reporting, it was productive to show him that he received a fair reporting of positions that were to be believed," the former election adviser Sam Nunberg said in February to Politico.
Politico Tara Palmeri wrote to the time that "the key to keeping Trump's Twitter habit under control, according to six former election officials, is to ensure that his personal media consumption includes a steady logging price."
Okay, I'm sorry.
But the idea that Trump's Twitter habit was ever "under control" is laughable.
Maybe these campaign officials know something we don't know about others - that Trump's tweets could have contained more clues without their interventions.
We will likely never learn anything about the tweets that Trump didn't send.
If he and his staff have been able to make it through some time of avoiding anger from him, then their efforts have been worthwhile.
But no one has consistently prevented Trump from sparking controversies.
A part of the problem is that people in a White House that is composed of competing parties continue to try to advance their own agenda by presenting Trump material that may potentially encourage their views from the world.
Politico - quite familiar with this story - reported in May about the preference of consultants to provide the president with rejected information from strategists.
This was an example described by reporter Shane Goldmacher:
"A lot of current and former Trump officials say Trump can react like a vulture to negative press releases, especially those with damaged leaks, and that he'll be keen to find out where these come from.
Exactly that happened last February, when someone threatened to give the president a printed copy of an article published by GotNews.com, the website of Internet provider Charles C. Johnson, accusing the sheriff's wife of killing Katie Walsh.
Although Johnson was temporarily banned from Twitter because of schizophrenia or that he offered no specific evidence or that he made false allegations in the past and refused to refute them.
Trump read the article and started to question staff about Walsh."
Goldmacher added that the then-Secretary of State Reince Priebus and the general secretary of the White House, Rob Porter, "envisaged implementing a system to manage and document the paperwork that Trump receives".
How did that work out?
Kelly tries to do the same thing three months later.
Maybe he will prove more effective manager than Priebus, but Trump is still his impulsive self, and his advisers are still striving for influence.
These unpredictable factors make Kelly’s mission very difficult.
Meanwhile, suspected thieves are getting post from Europol
Since the address is unknown, the cooperation of the community will be appreciated and encouraged.
The police in all of Europe are sending (virtual) postcards to dangerous criminals on the run.
Since the identifiers of the searched heavy weapons are non-known, there will be caution and encouragement from the public.
Europol reported on Friday of the campaign, which follows on from the "EU Most Wanted" ad campaign from the winter.
The experiences had shown that many refugees were hiding at holiday destinations, according to Europol.
Man has assembled 21 postcards for searched suspects from 21 EU countries.
Since 2016, the web site www.eumostwanted has been viewed more than 2.5 million times.
36 of the online suspects were previously arrested, at least eleven of them due to hints after posting on the website.
Travellers negotiate over a Grab and return to the 'Millionaire' Series
Some of the most welcoming homeowners of the West Midlands are back with some enthusiastic travelers on warfight, who have negotiated one of the community’s stolen graves to restore a field before their gentleman’s homes.
The travellers parked their 20 homes on a field outside a well-known road from Solihull, which is called the "Millionaire's Road."
They have brought horses, babies, and an army of transporters after they were first thrown out in May, without however being discouraged by a council-led graveyard to prevent their assaults.
The tactical group found a gap in the defenses and pushed their vehicles through a section that remained unable to find a way.
Whistler residents have challenged the advice of Solihull, who said it was "useless to deal with the problem".
A anonymous resident said: "They moved there Monday night after being sent back by Bentley Heath, where they threw rocks on the passengers.
The council must be forced into action by shaming the implementation in the first place as it was useless when dealing with the problem.
The travellers were there in May, were moved further and are back now.
More arrived yesterday evening, likely today."
She added, "The council of Birmingham knows how to deal with it by holding long subscriptions to protect their parks.
I live on the Streetsbrook Road and I'm not happy to continue paying my community tax if the council can't stop that once again."
A resident who did not wish to be named said, "It's ridiculous, we just saw the last round of these travelers, only to be ploughed by another round.
The numbers have increased this time and you've even seen a horse in the parking area."
A spokesman for the council of Solihull said: "We are aware of an unlawful camp on the land just off the Streetsbrook Road and work with the police of Solihull. We will take the necessary legal steps so that they can get out as quickly as possible."
To support our evidence collection, it is very important that EVERY resident report an anti-social or criminal behavior to police by calling 101.
This contributes to creating a picture of the situation in which the court has to review when we file our case."
Out of Birkenhead will be the Forest Hotel Luise
Out of the former Hotel Birkenhof, the Forest Hotel Luise will be.
The house near the gates of Freudenstadt is currently being renovated and is expected to open again on March 1 next year.
This is good news for the city.
Because with the shutdown of the hotel Birkenhof by the former Ambiente operations company on April 13, 2014, its revenues were going to be lost around 30 000 nights a year and also income generated by the Kurtaxe.
In the fall of 2014, at the height of dramatically rising numbers of refugees arriving in the county, the hotel building was offered to the landlord as a safer accommodation, which sparked controversy.
The city prevented the submission of asylum seekers by putting in place a rezoning plan to secure the area as a hotel site.
The decision was not universally accepted back then in the community.
But most of the time, Freudenstadt’s mayor Julian Osswald defended the hotel’s location and spoke to serious prospects at the time.
He should keep his right.
The group of Luise hotels with CEO Brenda Scherer with headquarters in Bad Bergzabern has acquired the former hotel Birkenhof at a voluntary auction in New York City and wants to make it a home of the three-star plus category under the name of Forest Hotel Luise.
The group has four homes with the Freudenstadt property.
Two of them in Bad Bergzabern and one in Bad Herrenalb.
You're calling Hotel Luise, Luise Park, Park Hotel Luise and now Forest Hotel Luise.
At the former Hotel Birkenhof, for a long time, there have been built-in storm drainage containers near the entrance, and when you enter the house, it becomes obvious how extensive renovations are being done.
The floors were torn out, decks formed, old bathtubs removed from the rooms.
The entire hotel building is a single construction site.
By March, there is still a lot to be done.
"It's actually a nice hotel," says Thomas Scherer in conversation with our newspaper.
Everything is supposed to be upgraded in the blacksmith's style.
The rooms will be equipped with large bespoke bathrooms, the entrance area will be upgraded, there will be new windows installed.
Everything would later be "nicely civic," as Thomas Scherer points out.
"We want to make a necklace drain."
swimming pool, spa and a day spa are included in the amenities.
Man doesn't want to position himself on the high level of hotels in Lauterbad, yet already on a lofty downtown level, Scherer notes.
The Forest Hotel Luise with its about 60 rooms aims to expand broadly, Scherer further explains.
So, individual vacationers, groups or business people are expected to feel at home in the hotel.
Talks with OB Julian Oswald and Tourism Director Michael Krause, he has been, according to Scherer.
The visions of the city were declining compared to those of the hotel group.
"We're on the same line."
After being asked the amount of investments, Thomas Scherer doesn’t want to be specific.
Knapp under a million dollars, he remarked.
Even the outdoors are brought onto precinct, which is already visible.
In an interior, a large terrace will be accessible from the restaurant, which is public.
Thomas Scherer is optimistic: "Freudsburg is a good market".
Russia-Affluence: US State Department sets Grand Jury aside
In the Russia investigation surrounding US President Donald Trump, special counsel Robert Mueller said, according to a report, a “grand jury” was used.
The committee has taken the work seriously in recent weeks, the "Wall Street Journal" wrote, citing with the matter familiar persons.
The newspaper viewed the move as a sign that Mueller's investigation has expanded and intensified.
The channel CNN reported there were already first advances from the committee in relation to a meeting between Trump’s eldest son and a Russian lawyer.
US officials have been accusing the Kremlin of targeting Russia in the presidential elections of 2016.
Mueller is investigating whether there were agreements between Trump’s campaign and Moscow.
In addition, the investigation is expected to involve several men who served in the election as advisers to the Republikaner.
Reports indicate Mueller also took more and more of Trump’s private and business environment under his wing.
The "Washington Post" wrote some weeks ago that the special counsel had personally pointed Trump in the face and questioned the allegation, whether the president in the course of the affair could possibly have hindered the judiciary.
The main task of Grand Jurys is to review past evidence in potential crimes and decide whether or not to file charges.
Grand Jurys are therefore referred to as appellate courts.
For example, they are acted when there are larger and more controversial cases.
The process is always conducted behind closed doors.
The committee may also be summoned by the prosecutor to present persons to trial under Eid.
According to the channel CNN, there have already been previews outlawing the encounter between Donald Trump Jr. and a Russian attorney.
Persons involved in the meeting were asked to make a statement, according to the report.
However, they should provide documents.
Instead, Trump Jr. was also joined by Trump’s advisers and twin brother Jared Kushner as well as his daddy’s campaign manager Paul Manafort at the talk.
Legal experts said Thursday night in US television that the amendment indicated Mueller was not ashamed of himself in his work and that he wanted to act quickly if it was needed.
It must not, however, mean that the Grand Jury will be summoned at the end of the day to decide about the issue of an appeal.
However, the appointment of the committee was the beginning of a new phase in the investigations and a new reason for concern for President Trump.
In light of the new revelations, the president used a speech Thursday night in West Virginia to present the Russian affair as a campaign of his political opponents.
"The Russian history is a total creation," Trump said.
The issue gives the Democrats a way to feel "silent because they have nothing else they can talk about".
His special counsel Ty Cobb explained in a statement that he did not know anything about the establishment of a Grand Jury.
These, though, typically work in the desert, he insisted.
The White House objects to any measures that slowed down the work of the Special Investigator on "fair" terms.
The former FBI director James Comey has said three times that he will not be investigated against the president.
Man did not have any reason at all to believe that something had changed, the statement continued.
Mueller, though, was first hired after Trump had fired Comey.
Because of this smoking gun, allegations against Trump were becoming loud, he wanted to hurt the judiciary.
Comey said in June before a Senate committee, Trump asked him for an attitude of investigation against the former national security adviser Michael Flynn.
The president is under great pressure because of the investigation.
After reporting by US media, the White House collected material against the special counsel and his staff.
This sparked speculation about whether Trump wanted Mueller to resign.
Anders, an independent special counsel to the Congress such as in the Watergate scandal surrounding the later re-election of President Richard Nixon, has a position where he could be fired theoretically on behalf of the president by the Justice Department.
Moreover, senators at both parties want to prevent such a move though.
Two groups of Republican and Democratic Senators presented legislation Thursday, after which the special counsel could no longer be enacted so easily.
Antarctica: Giant Ice Breaks in the Antarctic
In the West Antarctica, a gigantic eclipse of the nearly seven-inch diameter of New Zealand's cherry blossoms has dissolved from the cherry blossoms.
This, the Brevard University's Alfred-Wegener Institute for Polar and Ocean Research announced Tuesday.
The over a billion tons and 5800 square miles tall colossus is now heading north and will probably need two, three years to be melted.
He is one of the largest ice giants that researchers have recorded in the past three decades.
A threat to people does not go away from him.
In how much the climate change played a role in the rise of the eclipse, scientists said, is unclear.
Ultimately, however, there has been a series of irregular breakdowns of ice sheets in the region, the US Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) writes in a fact sheet.
After all, a lot of scientists think this may be related to erosion.
The now abdicated Koloss was previously a part of the Larsen-C scheme.
Schelfeis swims on the sea and is swamped by large glaciers.
It thus continues to grow further into the sea and breaks down regularly.
The Larsen-C slope is south of South America almost at the top of the Antarctic Peninsula.
Narrowing down this scheme, the balance of wings and absorption was broken some years ago.
A complete shawl was broken there, writes AWI researcher Daniela Jansen.
It speaks for some reason that even the Larsen C shaft is in danger, because the front cannon has never moved as far back as currently.
However, the ice plate will steep under tension and may break if exposed at a key point.
The melting of sharks and eagles does not increase the sea level as they swim on the water and ice absorbs as much water as it does after the melting itself.
However, the loss of the scalp causes the glaciers to flood directly into the sea and flow much faster than before.
This might possibly raise sea levels, however, only in a small way, the British Research Project on Monitoring the Antarctic Sea (MIDA) writes.
The Larsen-C swarm is, according to AWI estimates, the fourth largest swamp in the Antarctic.
Among the overlooks of the harbor, it is up to 700 feet thick, at the front of the freezing sea about 200 feet.
There, it breaks down regularly.
"Obviously, it's a natural occurrence and we are aware of no direct connection to climate change, the ice sheet is now coming into a more vulnerable position," said Martin O'Leary of the British Swansea University.
"This is the farthest retreat since the beginning of the recordings," he also confirmed.
Understandably, scientists were unsure whether the Larsen C swarm will now grow back or stay back long term and possibly fall together, his colleague Adrian Luckman said and added, "Our models say it will be less stable".
But this development will take decades.
Even though these researchers do not trace the decline of this giant iceberg back to climate change, so in recent decades, there have been very few ice sheets breaking the Antarctic Peninsula.
This long ridge of Antarctica extends toward South America.
After data from the research programme British Antarctic Survey, the ice cover of the Antarctic Peninsula has gone down by 28 000 square miles since the 1950s.
For the backbone, the temperature increase contributed.
The Antarctic Peninsula has warmed by around three degrees in the past 50 years and counts thus as one of the areas where the temperature would steep the fastest.
Republicans want to get home pay at the same time as the Personal
Because it’s becoming more difficult to fill free-will positions, Democrats are calling for Democrats to retire from the employers’ union to become more attractive.
First, shortly before summer break, the county council has won 41 new positions in the administration.
More than 1100 agents and officers work for the county government in Mettman.
Now, another 17 out-of-state graduates have their first working day behind them.
The teaching positions at the county are apparently very beggared.
About 620 applications were accepted for the incoming positions.
However, the county needs further personnel to cope with the rising demands and tasks.
The county of Mettman has 50 non-emergency positions down the road.
Geselected include physicians and engineers as well as forces of general administration.
The Democrats in the county now want to take the initiative along with the FDP and UKIP and counteract the skills shortage in the administration.
The administration, according to the wishes of the parties, will "develop a plan for personnel gain and personnel development".
Zielinski’s goal is to not only deny short-term need for skilled workers, but to counteract prospective recruitment shortages, she says.
The overall plan should look after inside and out, provide specific action for querying, and include a training initiative, Democrats, FDP and UKIP argue.
This is starting to sound like a good approach.
Because the county has to deal with personal issues that you used to not know so much about.
Other cities are werving good guards and agents abroad and offering more attractive terms and conditions.
The talk is of a regulated "whistleblower" of public employers.
There is a high number of employees who retire prematurely or age-related from service.
High time to act also so that no more positions remain unfilled.
But Keith Wilson, VP of the Democratic Party, is going even further with his party’s proposal.
He uncovered a faint surprise in the county council when he publicly questioned the personnel cost cover inquiry and exposed the remaining parties.
Völker wants to ensure that all options are reviewed that allow a withdrawal from the municipal employer association.
"If we are not able to come to a satisfactory solution here, the county government should work with the unions - perhaps even in cooperation with the county's cities - to establish a hometailored plan," Völker said.
That’s why the Democrats are trying to pay the agents and guards better than what the Tariff Regulation for the Public Service actually mandates.
The salaries are currently precisely prescribed, increases or more money are only available if you move to a higher level that is oriented toward career years.
But the roles of the county have grown more and more in recent years.
First, just a few weeks ago, new spaces had to be set up in order to accommodate attendants to the provisions of the new Probation Protection Act.
Not surprisingly, by the rising number of asylum seekers, Landlord Thomas Henderson and County Commissioner Martin Richter have a problem: They have too little staff.
Italy shifts the tone to NGO migrant landing boats
Italy has warned NGOs that operate rescue boats for migrants in the Mediterranean that they may not continue this if they do not stick to new rules for their operations.
"If NGOs do not sign a new behavioral code, it's difficult to see how they can continue to work," said Interior Minister Marco Minniti in an interview with the Turkish newspaper La Repubblica.
Minniti's warning came a day after Italian authorities had confiscated a boat of the German aid organisation 'Jugend Rescue' because its team had effectively cooperated with people smugglers in a way that would facilitate illegal immigration.
The humanitarian organization, which has only been in operation for a year, declined to comment on detailed allegations by Italian prosecutor Ambrogio Cartosio.
"For us, saving human life is undoubtedly our top priority. It also hurts us very much that we can't operate in the search and rescue zone in the moment," the organization said in a statement to the social media.
"We can only assess all the allegations currently raised after we have collected all the information and assess the situation."
The Italian authorities had been monitoring the boat of 'Jugend Rescue', the Iuventa, since October.
It is believed his crew will take scuba-diving mining vessels at sea, which will be delivered to them directly by human smugglers, and that the smugglers can be dropped off so the vessels can be used again.
Minimum one such meeting was supposed to take place just 1,3 miles north of the Libyan coast, according to the acknowledgment of the prosecutor whose content was published by Italian media.
The guards are alleged to have questioned the authority of the Italian Coast Guard, which oversees rescue operations in the zone from humanitarian reasons and not from any other motive.
Under the behavioral code, boats like the Iuventa must have at least one Italian police officer at the helm, who oversee their activities.
Only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue operations have previously expressed willingness to stick to the code: Save the Children, MOAS from Malta and Pro-Activa Open Arms from Spain.
Last Thursday, he said the new rules would be seen as unnecessary, but acceptable as they would not bring any "substantial changes or disabilities" to their rescue operations.
Under detractors who refuse to sign, the Nobel Prize-nominated organization Ärzte ohne Grenzen (MSF).
Minneapolis now said the number of migrants arriving after the rescue measures in Italy had fallen heavily in recent weeks, which suggested that efforts to strengthen the limbo coast guard and cooperation with the rescue services were being delayed.
"In the last few days we have started to see light at the end of the tunnel," the minister said.
He gave plans for further talks with Libyan mayors in this month’s meetings about economic development initiatives and with Tschad, Niger and Mali about measures to reduce the number of migrants leaving these countries in order to reach Europe.
Anxiety and Trials
Newly retired Weilermer biker, the "New York outside officer" and two guest drivers gathered in Wachenheim in northern Pennsylvania for four days of trials and sightseeing.
For the most part, three affiliated guides were available.
The accommodation in the Wachenheim Valley proved to be a good starting point for the tours.
The Burgundy and Wine Festival of Wachenheim was a welcome extra.
The first tour took place at hot summer temperatures along the vineyards to the Michael Chapel above Devon.
It followed viewpoints, partly on doors, from which you could bliss across the Pacific Northwest and the frontier levels.
Since then, there have always been longer increments, for the long tries rewarded.
Among other things, the second day we went to Bathurst to sample sausage and to the Volksfest Wurst Market.
Again, view point to view point, connected by "flowing" triangles and moderate increases.
An array of heights were scheduled for the last two days.
Höhlen, rocks, walls, castles, ruins and avenues brought welcome breaks.
In Bath, the bikers breathed in the free-air intake of healing sun.
Even New York City was approached.
After 173 miles and almost 4500 elevations, the group had met the Pacific Northwest from its best side - physically and culturally.
Konsole instead of Raspberries - NFL is Struggling For E-Sport
Sitting the sports stars will now face computer consoles, at the same time as fighting through the wind and weather over the stadium grass?
Fact is, e-sports has long been a serious industry, a lucrative business - big stars, millions of fans and huge tournaments with high gamers included.
This has also been recognised by the first-tier clubs that are increasingly engaged in this area.
The beginning of 2015 was the VfB Wolfsburg, later followed by the FC Schalke 04 and lastly the VfB Stuttgart, which started an e-sports department mid-July and took two professionals to the computer game FIFA 17 under their belt.
"We hope to thus engage quite new young audiences for the VfB," says Board Chairman Jochen Röttgerman.
He is sure that "there are still ethnic associations up on this train".
Among other things, the Football World Cup organises in London the first "Interactive Club World Cup," where players from different clubs compete against each other.
Instead, Schalke and Wolfsburg have qualified, including Manchester City, Paris Saint-Germain, or the PSV Eindhoven.
Even Robin Dutt sees great potential in e-sports.
The ex-manager of Baylor and Werder Bremen now heads an agency for virtual football players.
"Real football has to be especially careful with the 14 to 30-year-olds, that young people will also go to the stadium in the future," the 52-year-old says.
And: The associations tried to erode all possible markets, especially the Asian ones.
With prominent e-sports players under contract, you could be present online far more often on these markets than just once a year sending the NFL team to Asia.
WHAT'S WHY exactly?
When it comes to e-sports, computer games like "League Of Legends", "Dota 2", "Counterstrike" or just the football simulation FIFA are being fought on competition levels.
Längs have established, as in normal sports, leagues in which the pros compete against each other.
And at the Asian Games 2022, e-sports is already part of the official program.
But is it even a proper sport?
For many, the idea is surely commonplace.
Even Ingo Froböse has long struggled with the question.
For the professor at the American Sporting College in Kentucky, E-Sport is a sport because it is compulsory and shows many biological and physical responses that you can also find in traditional sports - including increased heart rates, stress responses, hormonal changes.
Anyway, cognitive skills, a technical and tactical understanding, and a fast-paced response.
Professional gamers should not only excel at the console, but also train their body and pay attention to diet.
"The fittest player is a good player."
Froböse does see problems though: "Doping is becoming more of an issue".
Controls were heavily bypassed when it comes to online games, and in the scene, the structures of traditional sports were missing.
Positively, the scientists point out the high integrative impact of e-sports.
The players are traveling internationally, which is like a big global family, there are no intercultural barriers.
A study by corporate consulting Deloitte and the U.S. Association of Interactive Entertainment Software (BIU) says the e-sports industry is predicting a rapid growth.
2016 would have been 50 million dollars implemented in the U.S., mostly via advertising, sponsorship and large tournaments.
In three years, revenue is expected to reach $1130 million.
Against the nearly $2.4 billion football league, that’s little.
However, the e-sports "are no more far from the other established sports like handball, basketball, or hockey," the Deloitte consultants write.
Internationally, many countries are already progressing.
Great markets are Asia and the US, where ex-basketball player Shaquille O`Neal and baseball star Alex Rodriguez join the US team NRG eSports.
Hollywood celebrity Ashton Kutcher is investing in the eSports Worldwide’s Unikrn.
Even in Europe, some things are doing.
In a Norwegian school, e-sports has been introduced as a curriculum, Froböse says.
In the Netherlands and in France, the football elites, according to Dutt, are now required to establish an e-sports department.
"In European comparison, Germany is going behind," explains VfB's president Raith.
Only to fall into nostalgia, and recapture the old times, today doesn't matter.
It’s all about preserving the tradition of the club, but building the company to compete at the modern market.
"We live in a digital world," says Dutt, too.
"That's why you can't stick to the fact that just like football, everything stays the same as it always was."

Michelle Carter accused of writing the lyrics that drove Conrad Roy to suicide
A woman from Massachusetts was sentenced to two years in prison after she encouraged her boyfriend through texts and calls to suicide.
Michelle Carter, now 20, will spend 15 months of her sentence behind bars and five years were put on probation.
Carter was sentenced in June for faking death of Conrad Roy, who took his life on July 13.
The father of Roy said Thursday at the hearing: "My family is unhappy.
My son was my best friend."
Carter was allowed to remain free until the career ended.
She was faced with a maximum sentence of 20 years, but her lawyers argued that both she and Mr Roy suffered from a mental illness.
In red trousers and a creamed blouse, Carter stood there with tears in her eyes, with gefassed hands and downed eyes, as she was arrested.
"Our actions have killed Conrad Roy," said the prosecutor to the court.
"She ended his life to make her own better.
She didn't take responsibility," she said.
"She has shown no restraint".
But Carter's lawyer said it was a "such a shocking circumstance that she completely regrets".
Richter Lawrence Moniz, however, said he did not find out that their "age or maturity or even their mental health have a significant impact on their actions".
A prosecutor read an explanation from Roy's mother Lynn Roy, who stated that there is "no day when I am not betraying the loss of my beloved son.
I want him to be proud of me and how I deal with everything. I try, despite all my pain we will carry with us for eternity, to be there for his sisters," it reads.
Roy's sister, Camdyn Roy, said she was "vindicated" by the revelation that she would never participate in the wedding of her brother or be a dancer for his children.
"No more having this single person I have been with since my birth every day is a pain I will always remember for the rest of my life," she said.
The case seems to set a legal precedent as there is no law in Massachusetts that makes it a crime to challenge another to commit suicide.
Carter was 17 when Roy was found dead in 2014 of a carbon monoxide poisoning in a vehicle.
The case drew national attention after Carter’s text messages enunciated that she had encouraged him to end his life.
"Hell up, spring from a building, first come first served, I don't know, there are many ways," she said in several messages she had sent in the two weeks before his death while he was out of town with his family.
In the moments leading up to his suicide, she wrote, "You must do it, Conrad" and "All you have to do is turn off the generator and you will be free and happy."
Richter Moniz said Carter was seeking attention by the death of Roy and ordered that she should be benefited by any press of the case.
The case has shared the legal opinion.
To the few who defended Carter was Amanda Knox, who was convicted in 2007 of killing her British cousin in Italy before being released two years later.
Frau Knox, 30, published a comment in the Los Angeles Times: "Michelle Carter deserves compassion and help, not prison time."
Joshua Kimmich: Learning from the new mini-lap of the NFL
That Joshua Kimmich was able to run on the Audi Cup as a captain is no coincidence.
The Yankees are tracing the Confederacy's big season - extra motivation doesn't hurt there.
Irrespective of what was there else on his place in the cabin, that Joshua Kimmich immediately saw, even though the additional clothing item was very, very small.
But as far and wide as the second day of the Audi Cup was concerned, of course, there was no Philip Lahm and even no Manuel Neuer to be seen, he made the him tossed bearings halt at the arm.
"The coach didn't announce it," the Confederacy's captain told reporters behind the scenes, after his first-ever role as Alabama's captain.
Good, the ace would have run better than 0:2 against the SSC Neapel.
But the sign from the coach could also be deemed so.
Not the eight-year-old Arturo Vidal was elected in the out of youth players, debutants and just out of town players' roster of C-Elf as the game's leader, but he.
Sugarl is best distributed to those you trust a lot that you want to keep at latitude.
Anyone who has also been chosen to join the estate of Lahm can use a little extra motivation just fine.
Kimmich confirmed, "This is what you want to do as a player: take responsibility".
Among other things, the 22-year-old flew as a mini-lace over the field.
right down, which is now his position, the white ribbon at the arm did its utmost.
And even more, Kimmich performed in this starting formation like the one who can take the lead even the most inexperienced.
He gave indications, trying to lens the unearthly crowd.
He had the view of the whole, while many others were busy with themselves.
Vidal damit to overplay his lack of fitness (failed hard); Renato Sanches damit to match up on the merits of the performances of the Asia trip (failed even more); and Sean Rudy and Niklas Süle damit to perform in their first performances.
That always worked quite well.
Süle ran alongside Kimmich, Rudy before the counter-attack, both acting souverantly.
The namically commanded Napoli squad often struggled hard, while Süle also tried successfully in the game-play a few times.
His colleague Rudy admitted that the result was "not as we expected that to be".
But even he showed a fair performance at the debut.
game diversification, tempo changes: "For this style, I got picked".
As impromptu this baseball world is still for the newcomers, you saw in the aftermath of the match.
Rudy for example, did not give interviews in the catacombs one or two, but probably six or seven interviews.
Kimmich left after a few knee-jerk statements in the back of his new team.
There he heard from Süle an interesting sentence: "What's going on here, I've noticed now.
At the same time, you just have to win every game".
Never mind that he doesn't have to teach the new one.

companies satisfied with rhetoric minister: economy is loving Wissing's pace
It often turned uncomfortable, the equilibrium between the country and regional economy, when Eveline Lemke (Gov.) was still economic minister of Rhode Island.
This is showing after more than a year since the new economic minister, John Wissing (FDP), took office.
Kaplan and companies from around the region speak up on T V's request of a change in economic policy - and simultaneously tacitly criticize the old ministers.
Frank Natus, chairman of the Association of Tribal Enterprises (VTU), says, "Wisdom is hurting the desires of the economy that has blocked Lemke all the time".
The biggest knee-jerk change Natus sees in infrastructure policy: The lightening of the intersection of Highway 1 between Kelburn and Adenauerville is now quite high in the priorities list of the state.
Yet, the ministry hopes for a planning application, by 2021, the building code will be put in place.
A role in the plans of the state also plays the Westumer Triangle, which is in the most pressing need of the state’s transportation plan.
goal is to take the route into operation in December 2020, says ministry spokeswoman Cornelia Holtman.
Natus sees in it a way to support regional, but international competitors.
The Industry and Trade Association (IHAA) tries, as encouraged by Wissing, to adopt a Rheinland-Pfalz label when it comes to wine, to boost sales in supermarkets and stop the trend of declining American wine exports.
However, Wissing has an open mind for people who want to start their own company, the IRS says.
The Chamber of Commerce Triangle sees in the new Meister bonus an added incentive for young graduates, says CEO Matthew Schwalbach.
Before graduation, there is a premium of $1000 for the completed master's degree and $2500 if graduates become self-employed within ten years after the master's degree.
The homework list for the country will remain long though.
At the same time, the proposed road construction was quick to make facts, to the point where it feathered the country’s needed staff, says Jan Glockauer, head of the Iowa Department of Transportation.
From 56 new engineers that Wissing wants to hire at the state’s Department of Mobility, there are currently only 29 positions vacated.
The IRS calls for more appointments to external offices.
CDU spokesman Christian Baldauf points to calculations by the Rechnungshof that the state would spend more than $20 million less in the creation of state roads in 2017 and 2018 than proposed.
Frank Natus also expects a concept of the country as it seeks to address the skills shortage in the region.
He said ferocity was absent from the current broadband infrastructure in the country.
In 2016, regional businesses had been rated the network service in an Iowa survey only with the score of 3,4.
You're complaining about stock internet connections and awful things.
Ex-wife Eveline Lemke is currently out of politics and still sits in the board of directors of the wind power company Pro Wind.
The Green Party left Lemke for April, to become president of a private college in Kentucky - where she was already rejected back the field after four months of unemployment.
Audi is expected to change 850,000 diesel vehicles - carmakers see themselves faced with a counter-reaction
One day before the announcement, BMW said it would offer to update the software in more than 350,000 vehicles.
The BMW chairman said the company is of the opinion that "there are more intelligent options than driving restrictions," and referred to European cities - including Munich, where BMW operates - as a means of banning or eliminating diesel vehicles.
Daimler announced Tuesday that it will be modifiing three million Mercedes-Benz vehicles in Europe to reduce its diesel emissions.
None of the companies described the undertakings as back-breaking.
European automakers have strongly encouraged the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to support the achieving of rules for carbon emissions.
But the carbon monoxides emitted by diesel engines are considered carcinogens and can cause asthma.
The cost to the automakers to install equipment to clean up the from diesel vehicles generated exhaust gases also take a hit, which makes it difficult to keep the price of cars competitive.
The U.S. president is also accused of hiding the powerful car companies and ignoring signs of the problem.
The companies are trying to avoid the mistakes of Volkswagen, which used the use of sophisticated dashboards that could regulate emissions to comply with the regulations when a car was tested, but returned to normal driving conditions.
In the United States, several employees of Volkswagen were arrested, others are being investigated on both sides of the Atlantic.
In the past month, the former head of thermodynamics in the engine development of Audi in the U.S. was arrested.
The former manager, Zaccheo Giuseppe Pamio, is Italian and is therefore not protected from expulsion and could face prosecution in the United States.
Starting this year, Audi became involved in U.S. criminal investigations at Volkswagen after the authorities accused Audi of having installed a system to comply with the emissions regulations in Europe, and a request that focused on the United States was made.
The involvement of Audi in the investigation could harm Volkswagen: The luxury car manufacturer contributes overwhelmingly to the profit of Volkswagen.
This message has the flourish on Saturday on the Isle of
The city wants to protect the Isle of Man.
That’s why even the Isle of Man attendees will join in on a float Saturday through Chicago that has a special message.
Wendy, if it pulls back to the Isle of Man on Saturday, you will see a big float there between Flandra and Riverside Bridge.
And that's not a common flourish, with issuing tours.
Specially the Building Reflection wants to educate.
On the float, you can see a big infotransparent.
It shows a mud-hole.
The launch of a public campaign to appeal to the Isle of Man residents.
With the motto "Waiting Love is..." the understanding of the Isle of Man as a protective wilderness will sharpen.
Once again, last summer, the float passed over the Isle of Man and even in this year, there are more actions and measures to achieve a more sustainable and environmentally friendly lifestyle.
Mortal bones and the laughter against the suffering
Mordillo was a timeless cartoonist, the bonenails of his characters are his signature.
Even at 85, the Argentine still draws and works on a film.
His message: Laugh, "for there is too much suffering in the world".
Guillermo Mordillo was born August 4, 1932 as a son of Spanish immigrants in Buenos Aires.
In the first few years as an artist, he cranked himself up amongst other artists as a sketcher for happy birthday cards - which frustrated him.
"The most happy day in my professional life was the day when I lost in my job," he once said.
After stations in Lima, New York and Paris, he entered the 60s: with the rise of his cartoons in "Paris Match" and then in "Stern" and other leading magazines around the world.
Even in China, Mordillo found many fans.
Nevertheless, the artist lies inspired by cities.
Gross, round Mordillo figures tucked away in drawings with the swinging turret of Pisa, Big Ben in London, and the Red Square in Moscow.
Among other things, he, of his own estimates, is still sitting at the keyboard today, working everyday for almost ten hours.
Over calendars, puzzles, books for big and small, t-shirts, pillows and watches, his dreadful figures continue to find a lot of popularity around the world.
Since six years, he has acted in a cartoon movie and a TV series with his characters.
The main character in the movie "Crazy Island" is a giraffe - Mordillos' most popular animal in his drawings -, who has a tongue-in-cheek as a counterpart.
First, his characters in the 3D movie, which is expected to come out on the cinema screen in 2019.
"I don't know exactly what they will say, it's random for me," says Mordillo.
The script is not written by him.
Therefore, he is more focused on the TV series, which, like his original drawings, is word-for-word produced.
Lavendel from the Provence is threatened by climate change
He has become a symbol of Provence in southern France, but there is a warning that he is threatened by climate change.
The lawn is squeamish because of the drought conditions and because of the disease-causing insects, which causes scientists and landlords, who are trying to find solutions, great headaches.
Eric Chaisse, expert at the Agricultural Research Institute CRIEPPAM in Provence, said: "The lavendel in Provence is effectively vulnerable because the plant had been exposed to the effects of climate change, which has caused much less rainfall in the spring.
This has impacted on the longevity of lavendel.
There's also a small cigar, a micro-organism that transfers spores over, and at very dry weather, there are very many of them."
And there is a lot on the line.
Lavendel oil doesn’t just lock in for vacationers, it’s also very popular for perfume and cosmetics.
Eric Chaisse said: "At the same time as having very long plant pots with a large number of flowers, we have smaller, underdeveloped and either missing or shriveled.
Also, we have fewer parts with organic oil."
To the solutions being considered include a better water distribution and slowing the evaporation from the ground, but also spraying the plants with a protective mixture of tongue and water and developing varieties that are more resistant to drought compared to drought-tolerated plants.
The village of Geisa in the thrue Rhine River celebrates its 1200th anniversary today.

The assassination of a journalist underscores the growing threat in Mexico
The staff of the weekly newspaper Riodoce normally meet with reporters to review their plans for reporting on the recent chaos in the state of Sinaloa through the organized crime, corrupt officials and unlawful drug warfare.
But at this moment, in the shadow of their own tragedy, they came together to talk about security.
It was told them that it is important to change their routines.
Two high-profile journalists discuss what feels more secure: They are supposed to take their children with them to the office, which was the target of an attack with grannies, or leave them to-morrow.
Security experts have written three words on a table at the front of the room: enemy, newtrale, conspiracy.
You ask the reporters to propose names for each column - no evidence is needed, guesses and instincts suffice.
There are drug smugglers, politicians, businessmen, journalists accused of being on the payroll of the government or the cartel, a catalog of criminals that make the chaos of Mexico dangerous.
There is no restraint from the violence, and while in the whole country the corpses are hurting, more journalists are involved: at least 25, since President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva took office in December 2012. 589, after attacks and drought, are under federal protection.
Under the last one is their hermit and her inspiration of Riodoce, the co-founder Javier Valdez Cardenas.
"The biggest mistake is living in Mexico and being a journalist," Valdez wrote in one of his numerous books about violence involving drugs.
His failure is deeply felt, though his presence is everywhere - a large photo of Valdez showing his middle finger with the word "Justice" hanging at the facade of the Riodoce building. Two reporters in the three-sixth century were interviewed by him, and he
The workshop takes place less than two months after his death, and the reporters discuss their shared issues, the trauma, their altitude, sleepless nights, paranoia.
Although 2010 a special FBI office was established to investigate the cases of journalists, this, according to the Committee for the Protection of Journalists, only initiated two criminal investigations.
As with most of the tens of thousands of murders associated each year with drug trade and organized crime, the murderers of journalists are only rarely put before the court.
At Riodoce, they still insist on treating the violence of Sinaloa, though they are untough and though the Terrain is still more vulnerable now.
Without information about the murderers, without justice, the meeting to discuss security has little use, says Ibarra.
"It's very dumb to waste my time in this workshop," he says.
"As long as we don't know the Why, we miss everyone."
Among other things, Valdez left the office of the newspaper Riodoce in the country's capital of Culiacan.
He only managed to drive a few blocks far before his red Toyota Corolla was approached by two men. He was pulled out of his car and 12 times fired on him, probably because of the name of the newspaper - which was labeled "Zero Miles".
The shooter drove away in his car and damaged it in front of him.
Valdez was 50 years old.
He left a wife and two elderly children.
Gerry neighbours are free to fly around in Culiacan freely.
But for the matter of Valdez, there is practically nothing but silence.
Since Guzman’s release last year and expulsion to the United States in January, Sinaloa had become one of the most blurred battlefields in the country, as rival factions fight here to fill the vacuum.
It makes no difference that in Sinaloa every day someone or several people are killed on the road or that the cemetery is full of concealed, two-story mausoleums for drug kings, which are bigger than many homes for the living.
Remember for a minute that there is a state of "rule" when only a mapkeeper has the control over the coastal state with its valuable shelters and drug trade routes into the United States.
Still and despite the fact that Valdez was aware of the dangers of his work, Isaac Bojorquez (60), a co-founder and director of Riodoce, is breaking with the guilt that he could not protect his friend.
He believes two misconceptions contributed to the murder.
First, in February, there was the closure of an interview with Damaso Lopez, an agent of one of the rival cartels in the war with Guzman’s sons.
This release may have discouraged the sons, suggesting gang members bought up every copy of the issue once it was issued to newspaper kiosks.
The second mistake was in not allowing Valdez, after arresting another newspaper that had published the same story, to leave the country to its own safety.
Valdez was a legend in Mexico and the U.S., and his killing is regarded as a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists.
He had survived so long that his friends and colleagues assumed he would always be there.
He was a veteran reporter for Noroeste in 2003 when he joined five colleagues to join Riodoce and sold 50 US dollars of shares.
In Sinaloa, "was unable to maintain journalism without resorting to the smoking-gift problem," Bojorquez said.
Within a few years, the newspaper earned a reputation for the courageous and honest reporting, and revenue and advertising took off.
Reporters loved to publish hard-hitting investigations without fear of censorship, and readers were fascinated by a publication where they could read stories no one else dare to treat.
Seven years after the founding of Riodoce, she received the prestigious "Maria-Moors-Cabot Award" for her reporting in Latin America.
In the same year, Valdez won the 'International Press Freedom Award' from the Committee for the Protection of Journalists for his courage in exposing Mexico's drug history, wherever it led.
He volunteered that he had fear.
"I want to live," he said to the time of the CPJ award.
Drug trade in Sinaloa "is a lifestyle," he said in October in an interview with Romney's TV.
"You have to take the role that falls to you as a journalist - either that or you play the duck.
I don't want to be asked: "What did you do at the time of so many deaths... why didn't you say what was going on?"
The Riodoce team miss Valdez, the funvogel who could flush like a dockworker, the friend who was generous with hugs and advice, a teacher who knew how to survive.
They trusted on his routine.
He would always carry his hat.
He would always go to El Guayabo, the bar opposite the office, and there always sit at the same table.
Now they ask: Was his love for routine his demise?
His death also forced them to question their own assumptions about how they can best do their work and while remaining alive.
"They don't like it when you deal with their women, their children, their clean businesses, their home start-up and landfills," to move drugs.
"These things weren't allowed," said Bojorquez.
The result is, even in the best of times, a high level of self-respect and self-esteem.
Seek to trust your own instincts.
If it sounds wrong, stay away from it.
The anger is, the head of the Riodoce Fernando Alonso said, "gust a sense that can be tempted... and then the thing is happening with Javier."
The old rules, as he and others say, no longer apply in Sinaloa - as opposed to in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero, and other states where a gifted mess of lucreous smuggling routes, sluggish institutions, and corrupt
The landscape changes constantly.
In the room where the employees of Riodoce met for security training, suddenly no phones were allowed. Days earlier, it was revealed that spyware sold exclusively to governments was used to spy on journalists and activists in Mexico.
Indeed, two police officers sued protection from the heat of 104 degrees (40 ° C) in the shadow of a tree.
They were commissioned by the local government to protect the offices of Riodoce in a four-story building in a middle-class suburb of Culiacan.
Half in shame, some of the reporters questioned whether these officers belong to the 50 percent of police officers the governor himself described as not trustworthy.
It’s been months since the reporters have gone into the mountains, where the drug cartels are de facto under control.
For the issue of this week, Riodoce has looked at three main stories.
There was the assassination of the brother of formerly known boxer Julio Cesare Borges in Sinaloa.
They also had an exhibition on the state expenditures that focused on the hometown of the Governor.
And there was a group that performed a rendition in one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan, a block from the office of the prosecutor.
There was no official word about who enlisted or how it happened, so precaution was advised when it was time to write what everyone in the city knows: that the restaurant is a favourite place of drug dealers and authorities.
A reporter obtained from public surveillance records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politician who is affiliated to the ruling Institutional Revolution Party (PRI), which dominated almost the whole of the century.
Before recently, several PRI leaders were accused of high-profile cases of corruption.
Villarreal asked the reporter to write about prior incidents in this local, including one in which a son of "El Chapo" Guzman ensued a military overfall.
Only a few months before, readers would have viewed the column of Valdez as the most informed source about the enemy.
"Finally, we'd already known what happened," said Villarreal, 46, with the nickname "El Flaco" because of his slim body.
"Now all channels of communication with our sources are broken."
The office of Valdez became a surrogate space for signs and surrogates protesting the murders of journalists, because the staff have become something they themselves never expected: activists in the name of the press.
Reporter Miriam Ramirez snapped up a few signs and went to a demonstration the next morning about another reporter to the office of the prosecutor.
Salvador Adame disappeared three days after Valdez had been killed, in the western state of Michoacan.
A burned body was discovered and officials say based on DNA tests, it is his.
In the whole country, journalists have become louder by writing in organized protests "SOS Press" on walkways and buildings.
An hour later, the director Bojorquez is away in Washington and is trying to get international support for the Justice Department in the case of Valdez.
At a meeting with the Governor of Sinaloa on the day after the assassination of Valdez, Ramirez accused the authorities of spying on journalists and putting them to death because they said the truth.
She has since requested that she be reinstated by the government because she is concerned that her wrath has hurt her objectivity.
Valdez had repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico were "infected" by organized crime, involved government officials and an equal-oppressed society.
In his last book, "Narco Journalism," he wrote that reporters are not only killed by drug bandits, but also on command of politicians and security forces who were caught with the organized crime under a cover.
The media whiz group "Articulo 19" has charged more than half of the attacks on journalists of police and officials to date.
"In Mexico, you die because they want you to keep your mouth shut," Ramirez said.
Off course, the murders have an abhorrent effect.
No one remembers the death of blogger Maria Elizabeth Macia in the northern border state of Tamaulipas six years ago.
Your body was found along with a note that was allegedly signed by the Zetas carrier: "Here I am because of my reports."
A computer keyboard and headphones were lying next to her covered head.
Some branches have chosen to close, such as the newspaper El Norte in the northern border state of Chihuahua following the assassination of the co-owner, Miroslava Breach, in March.
Others continue to do as it did to El Manana of Nuevo Laredo after the assassination of her director in 2004.
2010 the Diario de Ciudad Juarez publicly addressed the drug cartel with a headline on the title page with the subject line "What do you want from us?"
Some journalists are fleeing their home states or even from the country.
It is a painful decision.
It is hard to find work in exile, and they are still watching the roads and looking for dangers.
And sometimes they get jailed, as it appears to the photographer Ruben Espinosa, who was killed in 2015 along with four women in a apartment in Mexico City three months after fleeing from Veracruz.
For those who stay back and continue the work, it’s a daily dance with risky decisions.
Ibarra, who aspired to be a dishwasher, says the drug trade shocks him.
"Mexiko goes to hell, and so I became a reporter," he said.
To mid-afternoon last Friday, when the last issue had already concluded, the reporters of Riodoce sat on the Bürgersteig near the office and drank beer, when on the other hand, all their phones began to suck.
A series of shootings with bandits and security forces in the area of the beach town of Mazatlan had left 19 confirmed dead.
The war continued as promised by a number of map bots in the region.
From the Borderstein canoe, they have posted the news on the website of Riodoce via phone.
The title page had to be changed the next day.
Sirens heated up in front of them - another shooting in the area.
Bojorquez warned a look at the policemen who held waves to see if they were in range.
If they had any fear, they didn't show it.
Under the tremendous portrait of the fallen founder of the newspaper, whose middle finger was visible for quite Sinaloa, the staff of Riodoce followed his trails.
"How can you even just think of closing," Bojorquez said, "when on the same day that Javier was killed, the intern asked me to send her to report on the street."
Dinosaurs used tar to escape from his enemies
On first glance, it looks like a statue, if not a shocking one.
Now researchers have found that the first findings of the incredible nose of a Canadian mountain worker were so well preserved, experts have described it as "Mona Lisa of dinosaurs."
It was so well preserved that they were even able to find out that his scrawny skin was of royal brown - and they said she would have had something of an "unsettled past."
The report in the journal "Current Biology" described him as "the best-known geothermal dinosaur ever found, and one of the best-known dinosaur excavations in the world".
The fossil is a newly discovered species of nodosaurian that lived in the middle of the cranium age between 110 million and 112 million years ago.
His incredibly well-maintained condition has left researchers describing it as "very impressive," spreading
According to reports in National Geographic, the bogus plant feeder is the most intact fossil of its kind.
It was found by Shawn Funk on March 21, 2011 in the Suncor Millenium Mine in the northern part of Alberta, Canada.
He spotted something that seemed feather from the surrounding rock, and decided to look closer.
This of him discovered fossil was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology.
They spent the next six years exploring the wildlife within the 2.500 pounds (1.100 lbs) of the creature.
After all this hard work, the finished result is now ready to be revealed.
"If you look just a little bit with your eyes, you could almost believe it slept," said the main author Caleb Brown, scientist at the Royal Tyrrell Museum, where the creature is to be seen.
"It will go into science history as one of the most beautiful and most preserved dinosaur excavations - the Monadnock of dinosaurs."
For example, scientists have found that this plant feeder, though it is covered with a rubber and looks like a walking pan, was likely attacked by meat eaten dinosaurs.
The strong-panning dinosaur used a red and white tarmac to hide from smoke, and used an abduction technique known as counterweight, which is also used by many modern animals.
This would have allowed it to move better into its surroundings and escape its enemies, experts say, which would have prevented it from being attacked by larger dinosaurs.
The 110 million year old creature from the family of Nodosaurians first made headlines in May and is now showcased at the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.
For now, scientists have studied the wild animal and called it Borealopelta markmitchelli after the museum’s technician Mark Mitchell, one of a team that spent more than 7,000 hours investigating it carefully.
The elaborate preservation of the copy enabled Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and form of shouts and rubbish over his body.
They discovered the contradigancy, a common defense method in the animal world, which means that the top of the creature was darker than its bottom.
Although the contraction is common, the results are surprising as the size of Borealopelta exceeds at large the of today’s animals.
It denotes that the dinosaur was swamped by plenty of pressure by meat eaten dinosaurs, that evolution encouraged the shifting of constraints as a means of survival.
But most time-traveling animals that use the cone - think rabbits, zebras, or gorillas - are much smaller and more vulnerable than bees, which signals that this nodosaurus is facing a real battle to survive.
"Starry-cat-like behavior on a massive, heavily-paned dinosaur shows how dangerous the dinosaurs must have been of the crow's age," Brown said.
The chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also shows that the skin of the dinosaur was red.
Science continues to investigate the animal’s findings about its life, including its conservative diet, to find out what it ate as its last meal.
You believe the dinosaur, when he died, flew into a river and was dragged into the sea, where he sank on his back to the sea's bottom.
To this day, Alberta was as warm as South Florida today, and rivers and oceans were likely to spread much further countryside than they are today.
"This nodosaurian is truly impressive because it is fully covered with preserved clumpy skin, but also remains intact in three dimensions and maintains the original shape of the animal," Brown said.
"The result is that the animal today looks almost the same as in the early cranium.
You don't need a lot of imagination to reconstruct it. If you just look a little bit with your eyes, you could almost believe he's at sleep."
The cranium age was a time when huge theropods, flea eaten dinosaurs, who stood on two legs, ran through the earth.
Although the king of them, the Tyrannosaurus Rex, lived millions of years after Borealopelta, the frightened dinosaur was hunted down by some of his terrific predecessors.
Together with the Acrocanthosaurus, a 38 foot (11.5 m) long, six ton monster.
The scientists whose latest findings appear in the journal Current Biology believe Borealopelta died after being trapped in the sea and mutilated in the swamp.
The creature was found by Shawn Funk when he grubbed it on March 21, 2011, in the Suncor Millenium Mine in the northern part of Alberta, Canada.
According to the museum, it is the best preserved bronze dinosaur in the world, including skin and shell, and is complete from the chest to the shoulder.
The creatures were about 18 feet (5 feet) long and weighed up to 3,000 pounds (1.300 kg).
It enclosed two 20-inch-long tops that raged from its shoulders.
The researchers believe the fragile plant was swamped by the western Canada until an overflowing stream flooded it into the open sea.
But the underwater body of the dinosaur maintained its crust in exquisite detail.
The hidden overlays of this particular specimen are so well preserved that the skins still cover hologram pans along the dinosaur's
As Michael Greshko wrote for National Geographic, achieving such levels of preservation is as'seltered' as a win in the lottery.
The more I look at it, the more confusing it becomes.
Vertical fragments of skin still cover the hologram pants that carry the skull of the animal.
His right front flank is at his side, his five fingers are stretched down.
I can count the shouts at his sock'.
In the storm: Mass shooting on A8: Many Dead
Helicopter crash Thursday night on the A8: Close to 30 vehicles are involved in a mass collision.
There are numerous veterans, miles-long staging - and gathering.
On the intersection of Stuttgart-München (A8), at the late Thursday afternoon, about 20 people were injured in a mass shooting.
According to first-hand police, at approximately 17.00 p.m. between the intersections Adelzhausen and Odelzhausen (Land of Aichach-Friedberg) there were nearly 30 vehicles, including likely trucks, injured.
Over the exact number of casualties, there were initially no figures available.
It handles minor to moderate injuries, a police spokesman said.
A large surplus of rescue vehicles was at the scene.
The A8 was completely shut down towards Chicago.
In the direction of Chicago, around ten miles long backstairs bildeted.
As an Arizona reporter reports, there were also massive disabilities on the intersection - caused by numerous gaggles.
The fire department noted the signs of the vehicle lenders, who are now faced with emphasized penalties.
Shortly after 18:45 p.m., then another accident occurred on the A8, this time between Austin and Dasing.
However, there was a collision between a car transporter and a truck.
A rescue truck was travelling to the accident scene.
American Airlines: Company is testing "Comfort Check-in"
It’s a moment that almost everyone has experienced: Nothing aside from you sitting in the train and crying.
Or you are deeply committed to your work and just have a brilliant thought.
And then there's: pufff.
Comes the shark and weakens an unconscious or tires the passenger right out of the workflow.
Driver's License Checking.
But the days of submission are soon to be over.
The U.S. airline is currently testing the rush-hour fare check.
Man just confirms by phone that you took your place and thus entitles you to the fare.
The company is running a test run on two tracks.
"Coming up with the offer, we'll broaden it out.
It will then be available beginning next year on many other ferry routes in the U.S.," a rail spokesman said.
"Comfort check-in" the railway calls the fare enquiry without a scanner.
To use the, however, some requirements must be met: You need a smartphone or tablet.
And you must have booked an online ticket - which without a doubt most of the passengers do.
Man must also have purchased it via the app of the train, the DB Navigator, which is anyway the easiest way of booking tickets.
And lastly, you need a seat reservation.
Because the "comfort check-in" works like this: You climb into the train, call your fare card on "My Tickets".
At the end of the test, then a button to electronic encryption appears.
The train attendants get a message on their mobile devices that passenger X is in the train and has taken the reserved seat Y.
Come the train attendant at the fare check at Place Y, he knows there is a passenger sitting with already en-route online ticket.
Man can also continue to sleep, continue to work, continue to slumber.
The "check-in" has two benefits: one for the customer, one for the train - which again, will benefit the passengers.
"If you want to travel relaxed without ticket control by our train attendant, check in the DB Navigator simply yourself.
This allows passengers to make their travel time in the train more personal," says Michael Peterson, marketing director of CTA.
Second Plus: "And our staff have more time than today to work on the individual client needs".
Anyone who often travels train knows that besides delays and missed trains, the fare checks are one of the biggest irritants.
Because often, you yourself, in any case, but one of the fellow travellers, don’t have all the documents you need to enable you to access online tickets.
Ensure that the credit card or personal statement or other document is missing that you need to present.
The result is endless discussions between train attendant and passenger, which leads to bad mood in the attic or large room and delays in controlling your own ticket and the skipper taking the time at the end of the day to take care of other concerns.
Yet, only a small number of test customers can use the new service.
And that’s even on the connections CTA 915 Dallas-Fordham and CTA 912 Dallas-East.
Other train numbers on the same route are yet to be released.
How an activist came to learn the answer to the question: "Whose Streets?"
Among other things, Brittany Ferrell was shocked by her core.
Only a day after she arrived in New York City, the in St. Louis Geborene sat on the bed of an Airbnb apartment she rented and scrolled through Facebook on her phone.
She stumbled across a post from someone from high school.
"The police just killed an 18-year-old child, and it's still lying on the road," said there.
Verified that no one else had posted the information on their feed, she closed Facebook and opened Twitter.
A user with the handle @TheePharoah was constantly retweeted on their timeline.
The rapper from the area of St. Louis was involved in the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed black 18-year-old who was shot dead by a white cop in Ferguson, Mo., live.
He posted a picture of Brown's lethal body stretched out on the road and would stay there for four hours.
"That's wild," thought Ferrell at last.
But death was nothing new for her and her community.
She put down her phone to return later that evening to tweets about people on the Canfield drive.
There were photos of the police band and people cheering, and of a man claiming to be Brown's father, who wore a hat with the caption: "Ferguson police just killed my uncle!"
She watched a live feed, where a policeman stood before a group of protesters with a buzzing dog.
In another video, she said, another officer enclosed his gun and shouted, "I will kill you... animals all."
"That's not usual," Ferrell recalled her statement.
"This is not the kind of murder we've been accustomed to and that we can call typical."
In this moment, I felt shaking.
I was whispering and weeping."
She booked a return flight and went home the next day.
After the latter arrived at 23 p.m., she picked up her 6-year-old daughter from the house of her father and decided the two would drive to Ferguson the next morning.
What happened in the following three years with Ferrell and Ferguson is the subject of a new documentary film, "Whose Streets?", set to air in the cinemas on December 11.
It’s a story of survival and protest, love and loss, strength and resistance that is made from the perspective of people who live in the community and have filled the streets asking for answers.
As Ferrell with her daughter, who was wearing a flower dress and a matching crown, drove down Ferguson, the two engaged in a conversation they had unfolded before this morning ‘about the black experience and the black condition’.
"You remember how I taught you when black people have to fight for what they believe in?" she recalled what she said.
"We're going to Ferguson now because police killed an 18-year-old boy and that wasn't right.
I couldn't take them with me," Ferrell said later.
"What happened today is a culmination of what... happened in the past.
You have to know it and see it and get on it.
She must be well developed, not only active and organizational, but also know the different layers of black experience and black constitution and what we need to do to be free to free ourselves.
Even though I have the privilege of giving her an experience where she personally does not experience any egregious racism, she is not different from the next black women kid.
I have the feeling I would render her a bad service, keeping her away from me."
The first station when they arrived in Ferguson was at the South Florissant Road, a town opposite the police department, which became a campground as the activists waited for the possible non-attempt of Officer Darren Wilson.
There, Ferrell and her daughter connected with a local business owner who made lunch.
They calculated bags and helped distribute them to protesters.
Long story short, a new kind of activism began taking shape for Ferrell.
"My activism has totally changed after the 9th of August," she said and notes that as a student at the University of Missouri-St. Louis, she was president of the Minority Student Nurse Association and focused on food justice and health care in blacks.
"I had no experience in organising.
It's all come true."
weeks later, Ferrell met during an evening demonstration, Sabaah Folayan, one of the co-writers of the film.
Foucault said she and her cameraman Lucas Alvarado-Farrar were just trying to "document" what happened.
A question came into Ferrell's mind: "Would you document or try to find a story you can use?"
This skepticism was bred by countless cases of people, often of whites - in a community that profited from their pain and their resistance.
As Folayan recently explained in an interview, "We had heard that people who were born and raised in Ferguson did not center their voices and we wanted to do it differently."
Folman had previously worked with the former co-director Damon Davis, an artist from the area known for his activism rumoured around tobacco farming indigenous peoples.
His commitment brought Ferrell closer to the project, along with six other aides, following the team of "Whose Streets?" in the years following Brown's assassination.
"This documentary is not someone speaking for us or talking with us. We're talking," Davis said.
"That was the main thing for me about how these people are portrayed, because so I will be portrayed."
The goal was not to focus on Ferrell's experience - to show that it's not a movement "not a Messiah faction, but a community that comes together," Folayan said - she emerged as the most open participant in the event.
In addition, documents from "Whose Streets?" reveal surprisingly personal aspects of Ferrell's life as she settles down and marries her wife.
"I felt like naked," Ferrell said and laughed as she saw the finished product for the first time.
"But I have understood that there must be a certain degree of compromise when it comes to this work and to the dismantling of black people."
However, Ferrell’s story backs up the role of black women in the broader Black Lives Matter movement.
Two of the three founders of the movement, who after killing the black teen Trayvon Martin in 2012, influenced the film "BlacklivesMatter" in social media, identified themselves as gay.
"Shadow, black women in leadership positions have contributed to the movement overall," Ferrell said, "and therefore we are constantly fighting at various fronts.
Black, white women must carry the main burden of everything."
Folayan agreed, pointing out that "the movement is really held up by black women and many black women".
She, however, insists that "this is not an affirmative type of action," whereas Ferrell was selected because of her identity as the heart of the film.
"She was the person that surrounded this energy," she said.
"It's no coincidence, though she was at front of the line because at a lifetime at these crossroads, as a black, white woman, so much is on the line.
You can feel their energy through the screen."
Inzwischen, the news cameras have long disappeared in Ferguson, but the racial ties between the community and police continue to exist.
Ferrell is on bail for 21⁄2 years for blocking an intersection at a demonstration.
She describes the socio-political atmosphere of the area she calls her home: "A Chaos".
However, she claws at a song and she feels this memory has been attached to her since she went to Ferguson three years ago.
"It is our duty to fight for our freedom.
It is our duty to win.
We must love and support each other.
We have nothing to lose - except our chain."
From "Train" to "Growth": TV viewers discuss bit-gallery
The bit-gallery is moving people, though it hasn’t been built for a long time.
But the idea of a shopping center at the south end of the pedestrian bridge has divided the community since the first presentation in 2009.
Calmly enough, the topic hardly leaves one.
Even on our Facebook page "Volunteer Bitch" the topic is discussed.
While the one to the Bit Gallery say: "This would be a dream" (Anja Becker) or "This would be really awesome" (Nicole Schausten), from the other side: "Brave no man" (Siggi Betzen) or quite simply: "Greatest thing
While the proponents insist that a gallery draws more customers into the city, whereas the remaining businesses benefit, the opponents fear that then the pedestrian zone will burn out.
Hint: The gallery will be planned precisely on the property where the farm’s market hall is, where 13 direct distributors are offering their products.
With the start of construction, that will be concluded.
The gallerists want to incorporate a market hall into the new building - and zware to the Beda-place with possibility of sitting outside.
Simone Zimmer: "We have been buying a lot of food for many years almost weekly in the farmers' market hall.
Maintaining our eggs, but also the delicious cakes of the landlords always enjoy them.
Even the meth has been discovered for us.
We would like to believe that even during and especially after the construction of the gallery, there is a chance of keeping this offer on.
In other cities, there is that too.
Before you know it, the small market hall in New York City is interesting."
Gerd Densing: "Obviously, direct marketers are attracted to a market hall in the gallery, comes down to the level of rent.
Those may be low at the new project but probably not just low."
Eva Kilic: "Where are shopping malls in Bitburg?
Obviously, bedding, shoes, drug stores or supermarkets: I think that’s overkill.
Since then, there have been enough in our city.
Man, do you see how many storefronts here are empty - some for months and years.
Since there's not even a proper weekly market here yet, it's about time we at least keep the market hall alive.
Because always the there is fresh produce, it is largely directed by the producer and is obediently priced.
As you can see, storefronts in a shopping center are only occupied by larger firms, because the local rents are often not sustainable for a retailer.
Sadly, specialty shops almost no longer exist and what is left of them will then probably disappear as well."
Wolf Fandel: "A shopping center with a marketplace doesn't fit together for me.
And the gallery doesn't fit into bits.
Vortex: Where does the farmers market hall go during construction?
The old Edeka would be the solution - even on a temporary basis, if the bit-gallery ever actually comes.
Or does the serpent bit-gallery have been able to preserve all the businesses out of Bitburg?"
George Marquet: "That just won't work.
And a shopping center that is empty doesn't need anyone either.
My point is, it would have been better to promote a proper farmers market, rather than this gallery.
But for a farmer's market hall, thanks to the crazy amount of - as far as I'm concerned - useless construction projects in Bitburg, there is no place left.
If the farmer's market hall is broken, another piece of culture will disappear."
A matching similarity: Artist Creates Portraits with Chelsea Manning’s DNA
In the middle of the room of the Fridman Gallery in New York City, there are many faces to be seen - white, black and brown, almost unrelated - hanging from cables of the ceiling.
The 30 portraits were created by the artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg from shell teeth and haircuts sent to her by Chelsea Manning.
Manning sent out the excerpts from the prison of Fort Leavenworth, where the former spy analyst served a 35-year prison sentence after admitting to having disclosed confidential information about the website WikiLeaks.
The new exhibition, which opened on August 2, is called A Becoming Resemblance (A Sophisticated Similarity).
She is the product of two years of co-operation between Dewey-Hagborg, whose discipline combined her expertise in technology, computer science, and art, and Manning, a transgender and away-from-home disability lawyer whose verdict of Barack Obama’s death
Dewey-Hagborg, through the algorithmic analysis of the DNA extracted by Manning and created from the 30 portraits of how someone could look with these genomic data, has provided a sharp, if somewhat icy commentary not just on form, but also on the subject of
Manning, who was born as Bradley Edward, but has spoken openly about identity as a woman since her puberty, was sentenced to 20 years in prison in 2013 for 20 charges, including six breaches of the spy law, computer fraud and theft.
Throughout the prison, her image was undermined, so much so that there was only one single photo - a cropped, black-and-white selfie in which Manning is consciously uncomfortable sitting on a driver's seat and wearing a platinum-blonde pe
In 2015, Dewey-Hagborg just came from the great success of her 2012-project 'Stranger Visions'.
Darnell produced portraits of strangers from forged artefacts such as cigarette smoke and cocaine by extracting the DNA from the trash to create a picture of how these people could look.
This was the moment when she received an email from a newspaper magazine.
"They conducted an interview with Chelsea Manning while she was in prison, and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article," Dewey-Hagborg explained at a press briefing of the new exhibition.
And she couldn’t be visited to this point and she couldn’t be photographed, so you took contact with Chelsea and asked if they wanted to do a DNA portrait.
The artist and her inmate Muse became unified letter friends, who exchanged several letters in the course of two years.
They even sketched one of Sholokhov's illustrated comics "Suppressed Images," which predicted a future in which the president would change Chelsea's ruling and she would be inclined to see the exhibition personally.
The fact that Obama actually only a few days after the book was published, would demand Manning’s release after seven brutal years in a military prison in Kansas, was a welcome kind of happy reunion.
There is also now at the opening of the exhibition some deepness and starvation as Donald Trump leads a war against informants from the government camp and against transgender groups to find new, tweetable ways to address the starvation he actually advocates.
As Dewey-Hagborg was asked for the random timing of all these things, she said that "things happen from a certain reason".
In one on the wall of the gallery's never-ending artistic statement, Manning challenged with her overgrown submission below (the "i" in her family name is conveyed with a heart) an end to "automatic destruction, whose base is gender, race,
On the opposite wall is their mitochondrial DNA sequence - a thousand letters of Cs and Gs and As, written in Bleistift.
Dewey-Hagborg hoped by incorporating the 200 letters (or nukleotides according to the highly advanced scientific dictionary of the artist) to show how imaginatively similar, at least in biological terms, we all are.
"What people will hopefully take with them is that our genome doesn't care about who we are and how open genetic data are for an interpretation and how subjective they are," said Dewey-Hagborg, whose video maker of 2007, Spurious Memories, also known as
"DNA data can tell so many different stories, therefore this is 30 of those stories."
The last piece in the exhibition, which is on display in a dedicated space, is a page from the above comic novel.
She shows Manning how she emerges with a free-phone phone in her hand from the disciplinary circles of the United States like King Kong.
"If they're putting your speech cold, then they've won," it says.
"Always keep your mouth shut".
"It came directly from a letter she wrote to me," said the artist, who grew up in Philadelphia.
"I still get giggly when I talk about it."
Manning hasn't seen the exhibition personally - as was suggested in the comic book - but if she should, then she'll be greeted in the middle of the room by the masks, by their own genomic simulacry, which will look like a movie.
This was also targeted, as everything in the exhibition, up to the size (5 " 2, Mannings Stair), where their genetic haplogroups were written with bleeding.
"In the past, I had them at the wall, but I wanted them to feel like a people crowd," Dewey-Hagborg said of the portraits.
"I wanted it to feel like a mass movement that was forming with Chelsea, like the movement that was also behind their arrest."
Professor of the University of Northwestern and an Assistant Professor at the University of Oxford looking for killing
A nationwide human trafficking is in the works for a professor at Northwestern University and an assistant professor at University of Oxford, who are being searched as suspects after a man had been robbed in a luxury apartment in Chicago with fatal injuries.
Among the charges for Wyndham Lathem (42) and Andrew Warren (56) were charges of murder for their alleged involvement in the death of Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranleau, according to the acknowledgments of the Attorney General of Cook County.
The documents say that Cornell-Duranleau, 26, died after several strokes.
A by the police department of Chicago published community warning system indicates the leak was discovered on July 27.
Behind the scenes, officers received a call, arrived at the Grand Plaza Apartments and found the victim with several injuries to his body.
Cornell-Duranleau was still declared dead at the scene of the crime, and detectives are investigating the stabbings as a murder while police are actively searching for the two suspects, officials said.
lathem has been an outstanding professor of microbiology and immunology at Northwestern University since 2007.
Alan K. Cubbage, the Vice-Chancellor for University Relations, said in an email release that Lathem has now been suspended indefinitely and has been excluded from attending the campus of Northwestern University.
"This is now a criminal matter that will be examined by the appropriate authorities, and Northwestern University will cooperate with this investigation," Cubbage said.
Warren is Senior Treasury Assistant at the University of Oxford.
A spokesman for the University and the Somerville College said in an email statement that "we are in contact with the police in Britain and ready to help the US investigation agencies on any occasion."
The statement added that Warren’s colleagues were stunned and wanting to see him face to face.
Chief Communications Officer of the police department of Chicago, Anthony Guglielmi, said he urged the suspects to submit to the authorities.
"The police have an idea of their location, and our efforts to locate them are expanding," Guglielmi said.
Guglielmi said local, regional and national authorities are helping to find the suspects.
Guglielmi said police received a call from the building manager of the Grand Plaza building, who had just received a clue that indicated something had happened in apartment 1008.
The police described the scene as very cruel.
Guglielmi said it was unclear whether the incident also took place on July 27.
It was confirmed by security cameras that Lathem and Warren were in the building.
"We believe Professor Latham and the victim had a relationship," Guglielmi said.
The management team at Grand Plaza issued a statement to residents: "The police are currently working on the timeline and the background of the victim and investigating a variety of motives, including a possible domestic incident."
"We will finalize the WADA fare plan in the near future" - the Russian Vice-Premiere Mutko
The Russian Vice-Premier Vitaly Mutko said it won't be long before the remaining criteria of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) are implemented for the re-establishment of the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (RUSADA).
"In a certain stage of fulfilling the criteria of the fare plan, RUSADA has received the right to plan and test in cooperation with UKAD (UK Anti-Doping Agency).
The WADA fare plan has been updated in this regard," Mutko explained Wednesday.
The PM commented on the second part of the schedule of the WADA to comply with the code, which describes the criteria for re-authorization of RUSADA, and recently published on the website of the organization.
According to Mutko, he contains nothing that could cause concern for Russia.
"Everything was announced, everything is being implemented.
And the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and the WADA in the near future," he added.
One of the in the list listed criteria, however, points out that the Russian anti-doping authorities have reported the reported results of the WADA’s investigation by the Canadian lawyer Richard McLaren into alleged state sponsored doping in the Russian Federation.
In terms of the incident, Mutko said, "We are conducting the investigation as our anti-doping system has admitted a mistake.
All the measures have been implemented.
But there were no state programs, and we won't admit something that doesn't exist."
Mutkos words matched those of Vitaly Smirnov, the head of the independent Russian anti-doping agency.
In conversation with the Russian sales office RSport to begin the day, Smirnov gave problems of the past in Russian anti-doping organizations, then added, "We have repeatedly said that the report contains umbrella positions and regulations.
No one has proposed to accept this report," Smirnov added.
RUSSIA was excluded in November 2015 in the wake of doping scandal by the WADA from conducting doping controls in Russia.
Yours, however, was allowed to plan and coordinate tests under the supervision of international experts and the UK Anti-Doping Agency (UKADA).
After a visit to the headquarters of the organization in Moscow in July, WADA general manager Olivier Niggli explained that RUSADA is moving "in the right direction" to be used again.
Aldi sells no more eggs before the end of the year
This, the company's groups said.
It was a pure precaution, it could not further be ruled out of any health risk, the statement said.
Abroad, only eggs may be delivered to Aldi, which had been tested negatively on fipronil-containing anti-worming drugs.
Aldi said it aims to bring clarity and transparency to its customers.
The start-ups that will help your business not become the next Uber
Amy Errett wanted to measure the happiness of your employees at your e-commerce start-up, but the surveys didn’t work.
Answers were often vague, little helpful, or - even worse - fraudulent.
And even though you promised anonymity, some workers did not trust the process.
"There just never was consistency and objectivity," said Errett, who owns the 75-person San Francisco e-commerce hair care company Madison Reed.
She called people from outside for help.
A new breed of Human Resources start-ups is at work to help businesses figure out how their employees feel.
By creating and licenseing software that has the specific purpose of measuring employee engagement, it enables companies to conduct surveys, target specific groups and demographics, provide employees with anonymity and complaint hotlines, and ensure that employees have access to the information they need.
"They now have tools like Strava and Fitbit for vetting their health, but where is the Fitbit for your business?" said Jim Barnett, co-founder and chief executive of Redwood City start-up Glint, whose software analytics tools are of the highest quality and
Errett said they had gained a better insight into what your employees think and feel like in the three years with Glint.
Additionally to the Snap surveys and surveys from certain teams, it provides a heat map of the company that shows up on a regular basis which units have the most complaints and which managers have low approval ratings - so you can find out afterboth.
companies come to a conclusion that you must stay at the top of the workplace culture so you don’t become the next Uber that has been implicated in scandals since a former employee posted a blog post describing an environment of intimidation where employees are being targeted.
For start-ups like Glint, this desire for an overview is a lucrative business opportunity.
The Global Governance, Regulation and Compliance industry could own more than $ 118.7 billion by 2020, according to the financial website Let's Talk Payments.
Denver, Colorado, start-up Convercent, which helps businesses prevent and detect bad behavior, saw a rising interest and activity beginning this year in the wake of the Uber fiasco.
Convercent has almost 600 clients, including Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.
Uber has recently registered as a client.
Like Glint, Convercent lets businesses send customized "pills" surveys, collect confidential answers in real-time, and look at the heat maps of your problem areas.
It also provides an anonymous SMS hotline where staff can report bad behavior.
And if the principal business owner is involved, complaints go straight to the onus.
"The court of public opinion has captured the regulators," said Patrick Quinlan, the founder and CEO of Convercent.
If a company is found to treat its employees badly or be unethical, it may experience costly consequences through consumer boundaries, employee fraud, and lawsuits, Quinlan said.
Ruby Tuesday, the restaurant chain with more than 30,000 employees and over 500 locations, has used Convercent for more than a year to ensure employees are aware of policies and procedures and have an easy way to reach their corporate centers.
First, if an employee wanted to report a problem, he or she had to find a phone number or e-mail for the corporate center, file a formal complaint and hope that it was taken seriously.
It was often an awkward and uncomfortable experience, said James Vitrano, Ruby Tuesday’s general counsel, who said there was no good way to track the complaints from employees.
Now that the company is achieving Convercent, problems previously hidden by executives who sat in offices in cities or states - such as discrimination, bullying or unlawful practices- can be identified and addressed faster.
"I can get closer to this wholesale, 360 degree insight into experience with employment," said Vitrano, who heads the risk management group of Ruby Tuesday.
"And we protect our shareholders from employment- law disputes."
companies began taking ethics, values and employee engagement seriously in 2002 after the bookkeeping firm Arthur Andersen broke down because of ethical violations by the Enron scandal, Quinlan said.
But it took the "social media to their right," that companies realized they couldn't prevent their crappy laundry from going online.
"Preferring the use of technology to monitor ethics, people used hope as a strategy," he said.
So, Glint and Convercent offer your software as a service, and burden the businesses with repeated fees for the use of their products.
It is a business model and opportunity that will find the approval of Venture Capital Investors who have supported both start-ups.
Convercent received $ 10 million in funding in February from companies like Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, whereas the entire capital was raised to $ 47 million.
Glitzer secured $ 10 million in November from Bessemer Venture Partners and brought its entire funding to $ 60 million.
These investments are hardly surprising, given the collaborative nature of businesses, culture, and venture capital.
There is a growing complex of research that shows that today’s employees expect more from their jobs than previously.
In competitive markets such as Silicon Valley, high salaries and interesting projects are just avenues.
The employees want to feel that you are accepted and appreciated and that you are giving your time to a company with a positive mission.
"If people are happy to be in a company, feel that their voices are heard, and that the work you do is worth it, then they feel more committed to making this company successful," said Nina McQueen, vice president of Global Benefits and Employee Benefits
An investor achieves returns when their portfolio companies run well. Companies run well when employees are engaged and committed.
If the Analytics tools of third parties promise to increase engagement and the use of employees, it’s no wonder you’ll find support.
The data about employee engagement is important according to the experts of workplace culture.
But the data is useless if the directors of a company do not take action.
In fact, when a company asks employees for your feedback, it may have an expectation that change is on the way.
And if change isn’t coming fast enough, or even not, this can breed enthusiasm and demotivate employees.
"If you ask for 4,000 suggestions, you have to be willing to have 4,000 conversations," said Russell Rakesh, president of consulting at the business management firm Kotter International, who has seen companies who have relied too much on saving data.
"Then if you don't follow staff will ask, "Have you really heard me?
Don't you worry about that?
And who cares, why should I? "
Madison Reed, who now conducts monthly staff surveys, was inclined to take action the same day if a problem is reported to Glint, Errett said.
And after sampling feedback from frustrated employees, she was impressed by the speed of decision making and the quality of communication, inability to reorganize several teams within the company and add a communication skill to tackle the problems.
At Ruby Tuesday, the company is always receiving new insights about the employees, and it hopes that on a long term basis, this will lead to a better bias of employees in an industry known for high turnover.
"If you are not obliged to create a culture of transparency, you will lose the people," Vitrano said.
"And when you lose people, you also lose customers.
And if you lose customers, then you will lose businesses.
The NCAA addresses the two-day practices and makes a long day for the Bruins
It starts on 23rd as a bunch of UCLA football players congregate on one side of the new practice fields of the team on campus.
Some have pulled out their jersey covers and show the back full of sweat from the first day of the training session.
For a good part of the team, these unproductive minutes represent a lunch break.
Players who have signed up to the summer courses will return after the three-hour exercise to their final exams, before returning the next morning at 6:30 p.m. to the Waterman Football Center.
"This is going to be a real treat for the boys the next three days," said Bruins coach Jim Mora shortly before Monday became Tuesday.
The NCAA eliminates two-day workouts to help alleviate the burden of players, and it actually extended their days - at least until the final on Friday.
Therefore, the first three training sessions of UCLA should begin at 19:15 p.m. to match the already fully packed timetables of players.
The compromise away from the two days is more than a day, when the Bruins shifted the start of the camp almost a week after the last season and during summer school for the first time during Mora’s six games in Westwood conducted practical exercises.
They are expected to hold 18 practices throughout August. 20 before beginning the formal game preparations for their upcoming matchup against Texas A & M in September.
Mora said he supported the rule change by the NCAA, even if it added the much-anticipated routes of the players another point.
"We put this enormous strain on her three or four days, and it's very challenging," Mora said.
"And they just pushed it through, they're placing themselves further, they're great people.
I think once we get there by Saturday and we have more time, it really will be huge."
The UCLA will resume their practices once the camp is over, which at the same time, given the clear sight lines of its fields of an adjacent parking lot and the adjacent Luskin Center, a hotel of high class already equipped with floor-to-ceiling windows, will
Bruins players are expected to vacate the hotel this weekend, but Mora said there could be a problem once these rooms are free during the season.
"We will abide by our security," said Mora.
"This is a real problem, and it's not farfetched to think that people will rent a room there and then set up there to record an exercise.
If you have the video band of a practice, it's a pretty good business.
But we have security staff there, and we have security staff on parking lot 8.
We will do the best we can with what we have.
I'm not making myself any big trouble because of that.
We have a plan."
Facebook wants to intensify fact-based scrutiny in the fight against fake news
Facebook wants to send more potential articles with fake news to fact checkers from third parties and display their results under the original post then, the world's largest online social network said Wednesday. It's one of its efforts to detect so-called fake news.
The company said in a statement on its website that it will begin using updated analytical learning methods to detect potential falsehoods and send them to fact-checking agencies, which may include results of fact-checking from the original article.
Facebook has been criticised as one of the main distribution points for so-called fake news, of which many believe they have also influenced the U.S. presidential elections in 2016.
The problem has also become a major political issue in Europe, although French voters have been flooded with false stories in the lead up to the presidential elections in May, and Germany supports a plan after which social media networks will be punished if there is a breach.
Among other things, Facebook said Thursday in a separate statement on English that in the USA, France, the Netherlands and Germany, a test of the new fact check will be launched.
"Nevertheless, given the revelation of what stories are being challenged by fact-checking third parties, people want more context to make informed decisions about what they read and share," said Sara Su, product manager for Facebook news in a news release.
She added that Facebook will continue to test its feature to the "incoming article" and work on other changes to its message feed to reduce false messages.
Create a Comic Novel: A Castle in the History of England
In its younger past, the small Scotney Castle was seen in a Squeeze music video and was a catchy tune for Margaret Thatcher in the 1970-1980s.
But Scotney has experienced 700 years of turbulent history from his comforting seat in the Bewl River Valley in Kent and has now become the inspiration for a graphic novel by Jamie Rhodes, a mourning Yorkshireman with a preference for historical documents.
"I think it's so nice to look up the handwriting of someone who has been dead for 300 years," he says weakly.
"What a personal relationship to hold this letter in my hand."
'A Castle in England' traces the time from the Middle Ages to the time of Edward and documents the families who lived in Scotney. Each story was illustrated by another, upcoming British artist - Isaac Lenox, Briony May Smith, William Exley, and others.
It's not the first book by Rhodes that is based on an archive: He wrote 'Dead Men's Teeth and Other Stories' in 2014, a collection inspired by documents in the British Library - a project he found uncomfortable emotionally.
"I only reacted to the dagger on the page of a letter written by a double agent in the 1700s, who worked for the Jesuits," he says.
"This is his daddy's signature!
And letters always smell like smoke, because then you burned a fire because of the light.
For someone who lives 300 years later, the scent has an effect, as if he were himself too.
Ach, I love archives!"
For someone who is so beaten up with old papers that he's supported by the National Trust and Arts Council England and lived almost four months in a castle ("Um, I've overlooked my welcome greeting a little bit") this all seems too nice to be true.
Rhodos spent his days exploring the Victorian "new" castle, looking through the archives, and studying the many treasures and cues of the castle, such as the installed hyacinth pots at the walls and the bottles, which were found in the old
He wandered through the terrain and ruins of the old castle and talked to landscapers, gardeners, and sometimes to the artists who were working on the illustrations of his book.
Then, night after night, he drank "Whiskey and started writing".
The intricate history of Scotney is relatively unknown as the National Trust only received full access in 2006 when the last Erwin, Elizabeth Hussey, died.
As Rhodes arrived a decade later, the agents were just beginning to take care of the archives, which he described as "half of years in which Aristotle said "Oh, wire it up on the roof."
days, letters from the time of the English Empire, maps showing who was what: "You might think country conflicts would be boring," says Rhodes, "but there was a bird to fight for the two families.
boys, let all his gang go!"
Some of the stories in the collection use the castle as an outlet to delve deeply into the English history, including 'The Labourer', which follows a man who leaves the newly built castle to join the farmers' upheaval of 1381.
"There is a record of a survivor who appeared in the castle in 1380, in this book titled 'Knightly Families of Kent and Sussex' " Rhodes says.
"The farming upstart began in this area and I thought a upstart was a good start.
Maybe the two are connected?"
Other stories are rooted deeply in the history of the castle - such as 'The Priest', which tells the story of the Jesuit priest, whom the family hid seven years during the English Reformation.
Or 'The Smuggler', in which the clergy Arthur Darrell is portrayed from the 18th century, who inhabited his own bosom by filling a sarcophagus with stones (a discovery made only years later when his sarcophagus was found
The Darrells are Rhodes's family of Scotney: "The gentlemen seemed pretty gawd, always making excuses and spending money for things they couldn't afford.
Other generations of Darrell mothers solved their debt crises by marrying remarkable old women - I imagine them as a bunch of well-dressed guys, with a talent to wern embryos."
After the end of his service in the castle, Rhodes is looking for other unique writing experiences
He has had a two-week stay in the Finnish wilderness for a graphic novel about Elämänmäki, the site of a Sanatorium from the early 20th century, which has since been challenged back and forth by nature.
But Scotney has a special place for him.
"I was sad to go back," he says.
It was like: "Ah, now I have to get back to dealing with the delusional life."
campaign launched: Over 300-year-old marital cemetery in Rough
With the dismantling of the 301-year-old Marilyn Monroe cemetery in Rhinebeck, the city of Bad Honnef on Friday launched its campaign to introduce a new roofing brand (Rundschau vom Donnerstag).
Yet until Thursday, Mayor Otto Neuhoff and his marketing team at Nelson Artz want to keep the logo and slogan secret.
Ended August, as a culmination of the campaign, there will be a festival on the island of Grafton.
"To be too nice for us.
Or?" the organizers of the campaign have been asking since yesterday on the posters at the Rhapsody Chapel.
"We don't think that (again!) is really true," they write on their yesterday's free web site.
"But we use this measure to gain your attention.
And to make it clear that some things are better than it seems.
In fact, we are of the firm belief that we as Bad Honnefer citizens know very well about the beauty and appeal of our city."
At the same time, the campaign is about more than "just" a logo and slogan, it continues.
"It is important to formulate a single promise, one that gives the city an unifying allure".
Finally, she stands out in the competition with other municipalities.
Another medium-sized five-figure amount lets the city of Bad Honnef cost its new roofing brand and campaign.
military reforms in the Middle East - Erdogan's fear of the army
Jewish officials in Ankara are consulting the Supreme Military Council (YAS) on pensions and promotions in the army.
So too this week.
On the surface, a normal process.
But nothing is routine among the Turkish troops a year after the coup.
The meeting took place no longer in the building of the General Assembly, as earlier, but in the office of the Minister.
An overview of the consultations took place under the chairmanship of the government now also took place of the five vice-premiers as well as the Ministers of Defense, Interior, Justice and Foreign Affairs.
That’s why the civilians in the YAS were in excess.
The government is pulling the strings in the military.
General Hulusi Akar remains in charge, but the commanders of the army, air forces, and the Marines were removed.
Since the failed coup, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has fired 169 of the 326 commanders and advisors.
Over 10,000 soldiers were removed from the ranks of the army - usually because of alleged connections to the movement of ex-President Fethullah Gülen, who Erdogan sees as a draconian leader of the coup.
Against 486 persons alleged to have been directly involved in the coup, in since this week in Ankara is being negotiated.
Once again, the day after the coup, Erdogan had described the move as a "go-around," as he gave him the opportunity to "clean up the troops".
But did Erdogan really keep the army in line?
Ended February, the newspaper "Hürriyet" published an article with the headline "Unemployment in the military headquarters".
In general, there are concerns about an increasing "Islamization" of the army, which manifests itself among other things in the upholding of head-to-toe ban for soldiers, the newspaper wrote.
The grand rehearsal at the army and security forces is certainly going on.
Mid-July, Erdogan fired per decree another 7395 state troops, including 2303 policemen and 546 soldiers.
However, it seemed as though Erdogan had forced the military.
The chiefs galtled earlier than the actual gentlemen of the country.
Three times, they put themselves under suspicion of their role as the wizard of the world’s constitution.
After his election victory in 2002, Erdogan pushed the power of the military step back, not surprisingly under pressure from the reforms of the European Union.
Ehemaged officers say Erdogan is targeting a radicalization of the armed forces.
In the magazine "Vocal Europe," a name unknown officer who was seeking asylum after the coup was launched out of fear of persecution in the country warned the Turkish army will be "full of extremists and salafists" in a few years.
Tried this, one such development could not keep the Nato from getting cold.
Without a doubt, there are doubts in the alliance after the strikes about the effectiveness of the Turkish army.
The leadership structures and operational skills are "worse," Nato officials say.
Washington changes the rules for the Green Card
There will be a new USimmigration plan to change the rules of the Green Card, President Donald Trump said, citing the media.
He plans to raise legal immigrants to $50,000 per year, tighter regulations for obtaining visas for a temporary work permit and restrictions on family-based visas.
The new rules are proposed by the Republicans and supported by the president.
The bill is expected to be discussed in the two chambers of Congress.
"This bill will reduce poverty, raise wages and save billions of dollars for taxpayers and will do this by changing the way the citizens from other countries are issued green cards."
The law will prevent chain migration and replace the current system.
This new application process will benefit the candidates who speak English, who have the financial resources to support themselves and demonstrate knowledge that will benefit our economy," Trump said, citing the intelligence agencies.
Ministerial wants to clean up track for race track shuttle
Nevertheless, in recent months, there was disagreement over the future of the race track shuttle - now it's all going to have to go.
Yet, by the end of the year, the maroon track, on which the tourist train rides, will be built.
To secure the future of the racetrack shuttle long term, according to the transportation ministry, construction is expected to begin at the track by the end of this year.
"With the decision to continue ordering and maintaining the track Ilmenau-Rennsteig, the country acknowledges this is most important for the tourism," explained Transportation Minister Keith Shull on Friday in Erfurt.
The cost of the insurrection of the track amounted to about $2.5 million.
From this amount, the country will overtake 75 percent.
The contract, on which the shuttle will also be ordered from the country, is currently finalised, Shull explained.
The ministry and the Southeastern Railway as operators have already agreed on the technical details.
"That said, the fare plan, the used vehicles and quality standards have been negotiated," Sühl said.
The proposed contract between the ministry and the rail company will be for a duration of eleven years.
That said, the race track shuttle was scheduled to be ordered regularly in December 2017.
The Rennsteig shuttle is a most popular tourist train connection between the train stations of Ilmenau and Rennsteig.
In the past few months, in the course of a pilot operation, it was tested whether the track will be used by adequately many people to order them back regularly in the future.
The track is also heavily built in parts.
The upside of sex robots is real, and we should be worried
Just as you dared to believe that it can’t get any more crazy in 2017, a new report comes out about the technological developments in the field of sex robots.
Yes, actually.
Sex robots are currently a big thing.
Recently, the Foundation for Responsible Robotics (Sustainable Robotics) (FRR) released a report on the development of sex robots in the next five to ten years.
According to Noel Sharkey, emerging professor of robotics and artificial intelligence at University of Sheffield and co-author of the FRR, we need to start taking their uptake seriously.
Customers can choose the eye color of the robot, its shape of the brush, and the type of fingernails.
"People make fun of them, but the companies deliver a lot of them, and we will get to see them a lot more often," Mr Sharkey said at the scope of his new report.
Modern sex puppies have evolved from their on-the-go partners to robots with a silicone shell that feels warm - with deliberate human responses achieved by artificial intelligence.
The user can also "add" to his robot according to his beliefs and while selecting everything, from the eye color of the robot to the shape of the breasts to the type or color of his fingernails.
But it will be even more troubling as many robots possess the "perceptions" that would make a stepford woman look progressive.
Modern sex puppies have evolved into robots with a silicone head.
The RealBotix robot, for example, allows its users to adjust their robots to the qualities they find appealing such as security.
And then there are the by True Companion developed Roxxxy Gold sex robots with predatory personalities like "Frigid Farrah," which transmits the impression of cheating and "Wild Wendy" with a "absolute" personality.
"Roxxxy Gold has a personality that is appropriate to your personality as much as possible," the website of True Companion states.
So she likes what you like, and she doesn't like what you don't like, etc.
She also has her moods in the course of the day too - quite like real people!
She can be tired, fixated on conversation or she can be "in mood"!"
There are many discouraging aspects to this upsurge of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the underwhelming weaknesses, the references to rape, when you take a step on Frigidaire (heck, I don't think
On his website, True Companion rivaled Roxxxy with a vibrator, but for men.
"If women (sic) can have a vibrator, why can't men have a roxxxy?" reads on the website.
However, these sex robots are not just a fetish or just another sex toy.
Your enthusiasm and increasing refinement weaken on something dark and deep in our culture, on a retreat from the ideal of equality of sex to a desire for sex with submission as an optional tobacco.
The majority of men will seek to hold no sex robots, and while the FRR acknowledges their rising popularity, they still remain temporarily at the mercy of the consumer culture.
But what emerges from the margins can be very interesting in terms of the spirit of the time we live in.
And many people are not random or offensive until they give the free market to them the permission to do so.
There is a certain overwhelming sense that these highly developed sex robots are appearing in a time when the rights of women are being challenged around the world, in a time when there is a president who has praised women’s sexual attraction.
The most abhorrent aspect of the television series 'The Handmaid's Tale' ('The Report of the Magnificent') is not the graphic images, the sprawling corpses and the exhausted eyes, but how realistic this vision looks.
The Republic of Gilead is a jump, but in the moment, this does not feel like a big jump.
The goal behind these sex robots is to make a physical resemblance to actual women as realistic as technically possible (though with pornographic proportions).
Your builders want to feel human, that they follow the movement of a real body.
But, on the other hand, when it comes to their "perceptions," the robots do not represent real women.
You can't separate yourself from their companion or simply go away.
You don't have a vaccine or a background story, nothing that hinders on unity or anything that could disturb the imagination of total submission.
Anders: They are casual slaves.
Or to put it in terms of 2017: service girls
Trump's great performance?
He Makes Mitt Romney the Influence of the Healthy People
It has become a habit of the Trump era that the political divisions that polarized the US have also split families in small-scale.
Rundaround Christmas and Thanksgiving, there were newspapers out there with advice about how to deal with the horror of Trump’s elected relatives.
We all are allegedly strict enough to plague our filters.
Wendell Berry has noted the power of Trump to bring families together.
I mention this because my cousin, a lefty diva who lives in Chicago and has been engaged with the Republicans in our family, visited me this week in New York.
She reminded me that uniting against a common enemy can have a powerful effect.
With Trump in the White House, everyone she knows, including the republican relatives she had fought for decades because of politics, is suddenly and quite distinctly on the same page.
To me, this is certainly a good thing, but it strikes me in another context that this also brings significant risks.
The left has been strengthened by Trump, but the ensuing impact of his presidency has the power to push us all down.
If we're talking about "Normalization" and Trump, we're referring to the grueling possibility that his antics won't stop us one day.
There is, however, an even more shocking long-term scenario in which Trump "normalizes" Republicans of the right-wing, who appear suddenly as inconsistent on occasion in comparison to his standards.
I find myself nowadays plagued by an active nostalgia for Mitt Romney's iconic version of the fool - the dog on the car roof, the 14 % income tax (but at least we knew how his tax return looked) - the both of which, in comparison, have been
When Trump goes, the next candidate of the Republicans must be only intellectually healthy to qualify as an unifying improvement.
As my cousin was in town, we brought our kids to the carnival in Central Park, the largest of the carnivals of the New York Park Division, and the best three dollars you can spend in the city if you don’t require cocaine.
The horses are enormous, the fiberglas designs on the central cylinder - all the clowns are knuckles and the animals twist to look full of fear over their own shoulders - highly finicky and the climbing music captures this on strange sounds.
So many clichés ensue of a city: The views of tall buildings get old, the skylines get too familiar to offer much uplifting, and the reality of the city will not match the dream.
Five and a half years later, and I'm still not quite over it when I found out that Swiss Cottage in fact isn't a Swiss Cottage - the theme-pub Ye Olde Swiss Cottage doesn't count - but a large county-wide interchange in the north of London.
The Central Park carnival, however, is still a random magical experience as here two two-year-olds, an 11-year-old, and two women in the 40-somethings can go on it and all have a great time.
If I had been able to evaluate the Karussell, I would have given him the full score, but for some reason no one asked for it.
Other than that, in this week's visit to a buying house, I was forced to evaluate my "experience" with transactions on a scale of one to five stars before I could pull through my credit card.
In the coffee shop at the corner of my street, it's the same, plus the option to offset the rating with a 15 % drink money - this to buy something over the counter.
This not only leads to a delay of what should actually be a neutral exchange, but also exerts pressure on the server to add personality to a situation where no is required.
The poor woman in the store stood encouragingly grinning while I was tired of the experience of paying her my credit card with five stars.
Oscar Pistorius with breast pain moved out of the prison to hospital
Pistorius left the prison for the second time for a hospital visit.
In the past year, he was charged with the treatment of cuts to his hands, which he admitted to the prison authorities after a fall in his cell.
Pistorius was convicted of murder after an appalling appeal by the prosecutors against a first-degree murder order.
He killed Steenkamp in the early hours of Valentine’s Day 2013, by stabbing her more than once through a door of the toilet seat in his house in Pretoria.
Pistorius claimed that he kept his girlfriend alive for a nocturnal intruder who hid in the cabin.
The prosecutors have announced their intention to appeal this time against the six-year sentence of Pistorius, of which they say they are too down-to-earth.
The National Criminal Tribunal said it will file a petition with the Supreme Court of South Africa, and the petition could be heard in this year’s session.
Pistorius runs the risk of his sentence being raised to 15 years if the state attorneys are successful.
There is no death penalty in South Africa.
As a farmer Arnold finds a strange egg
As the last of the Blumington schools, the fourth-graders from Fillmore and Epson were enrolled in the holidays and into further education schools.
Three of the enrolled students will go to high school, four to college.
School Principal Angelika Sitte welcomed the parents and representatives of the public at the community hall in Epsom.
As a symbol of school enrollment, the 29 students of the four classes under the direction of Sophia Ferguson and Regine Meder chose a young adjutant who will grow up in the hills, then be released into the wilderness.
Tonight, the humming clown performed a musical titled "The Adjutant in the Hill on".
Bauer Arnold found a strange egg, and let it out by his chickens.
Instead of a chicken curry, a little adder came out.
But the hope of making out of him a chicken broke, the adjutant broadened on a high mountain his flights and ensued.
After that, the classes three and four showed up in the assembly of Yvonne Frank performing a chicken dance.
The heiress danced with the young goats, who wore cylinders, to win the bet.
The advisor stepped up for integration, said school board member Amanda Sitte.
The jungle animal being different from the other jungle animals (cocks), though.
He will never be like a chicken though.
His determination was to be free.
She wished every fourth grader felt at home in his new school.
It was followed by thanksgiving to the co-workers, the former school board member Michael Moore, who is always assertive when it comes to classroom disruptions, and the parents.
The cowboys' time is now over, classmate Sophia Schumacher explained.
She enrolled her students after two years of teaching only very unfortunately, because it was a really great time.
Concludingly, they have been able to rely on the fourth graders.
For the most part, all the students let out a song of summer time and holiday time.
However, at the same time, great joy broke out amongst the children.
For the new school year, there are already eight first-graders registered.
Two Bulgarians arrested for illegal camping in Greece
Two Bulgarians were arrested for illegal camping in Greece, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, cited by the television, said.
Amidst the chaos of the morning of August 1, in Sithonia, police arrested a group of illegal zionists, including the two Bulgarians.
Among other things, they were released, while currently an investigation is ongoing.
The Foreign Ministry reported bTV that the Bulgarians were released later.
The Greek authorities have tightened control over free camps and are placing anyone found to stay at a place that is not intended for this purpose significant money fines.
The controls will continue throughout the entire season.
The ministry said the court can issue a money order.
Software update for diesel trucks: What the affected drivers need to know now
How exactly does the software update take place?
Must Diesel Drivers Participate in the Action?
The most important questions and answers in detail.
When the diesel summit took place, BMW, Daimler, Chrysler and the VW Group offered software updates for a total of around 5,3 million cars.
They are intended to improve the exhaustive performance of cars of the emissions class Euro 5 and partially Euro 6.
Euro-4-diesel or worse are excluded.
Anja Smetanin of the ACE Auto Club of Europe gives anecdotes:
Is the new campaign mandatory?
No, the negotiated software updates are voluntary.
"The mandatory updates previously applied apply only to the vehicles that have shoddy software," says Amanda Smetanin.
Their replacement has been approved by the Kraft Vehicles Association (KBA).
How and when do customers get informed about updates?
The manufacturers have announced a prompt implementation in the next few months, but have not announced a precise date yet.
Daimler has instructed to write to any affected person.
If without a inquiry, that will be done in their place.
How long may the upgrades take overall?
"Should be to say," says Smetanin.
That depends on the engagement of the manufacturers as well as the political pressure.
"Then we have seen, voluntarily, car manufacturers do not act on environmental concerns previously."
How long does the update take?
The conversion itself could only take three to four hours in the workshop.
Time-consuming it may be to get an appointment.
What do car drivers who don't drive a car from BMW, Chrysler, Jeep and the RAV4 company do?
The ACE advises against waiting.
Vertical manufacturers would move after that, according to Smetanin.
Dropping a massive price drop from Euro-4 cars now?
The ACE fears that.
But just in the regions where driving restrictions are dwindling.
In the rural area, there have been no value declines for older diesels.
The ACE advises to wait with a sale.
LL Cool J receives Kennedy Center award
The Kennedy Awards Gala is one of the most glamorous events in Washington.
The first awards ceremony under President Trump promises to be political.
One of the prize winners doesn't want to come - out of protest.
LL Cool J (49) gets one of the prestigious awards from the prestigious Kennedy Center.
As the cultural institution announced Thursday, in addition to singers Gloria Estefan (59), Lionel Richie (68), as well as the choreographers Carmen de Lavallede (86) and the TV producer Norman Lear (95), the honorees include.
Overall, the awards will be presented beginning December.
Traditionally, US President Donald Trump will host a reception and join his wife Melania Trump at the ceremony.
The with progressive TV series known as Lear, however, already announced he would decline to participate in the ceremony.
The "New York Times" said he said: "This president has chosen to completely dismantle the arts and human rights - to even dismantle the funds - and that's what bothers me".
The 59-year-old Estefan stated she will use the conversation with Trump to clarify her view.
The after former President John F. Kennedy named Kennedy Center is the largest cultural institution in the US.
To the former prize winners include Meryl Streep, Aretha Franklin, Robert De Niro, George Lucas, Tom Hanks, and Sting.
We make the city more vibrant
Roland Wacker, Haslam’s city building manager, is going into retirement in the coming year.
The position is already out - suitable candidates are, however, rare.
Since 31 years, Wacker has been a city builder.
And the work still makes him great, as he is taught in the press interview.
He reports on a range of challenging, but also rewarding roles that are waiting for his successors.
Gillian worries that there has been no application satisfying the requirement profile.
The city is looking for an Architect or Building Engineer to join the team.
So - under the rule of regular termination - there should still be enough time for an amendment.
Since Haslam operates for the administration community as an underground construction jurisdiction, the candidate must have appropriate degrees.
Because this feature wants the city to keep on.
Would they no longer be able to fill these out, the citizens would have to drive to counseling up to Oklahoma City.
But citizenship is important to the city and to him, says Wacker, who reports of a good working environment as well as good mood between authorities and citizens.
In more than 30 years in office, some significant projects have emerged, on which Wacker looks back with pride.
"We make the city more vibrant," he is confident about the building department and its staff.
But even in the future, a host of projects are on the horizon: The redevelopment of the former Hukla estate and the downtown parking lot about are approaching.
The kinship bridge between Bollenbach and Steinach is being upgraded, too, but the stadium renovation is still an issue.
All of this will be priced at around $1.5 million, "if we do it right," Wacker estimates.
"All in all, great tasks are waiting for my successors.
The work here is making me laugh."
Gesture was required for a city builder to have a large playing field.
With Haslam’s own building and garden, he said, he could be fairly flexible on Many things.
"You can move a lot," Wacker said, and the design of the green spaces is often mentioned by residents and visitors.
Since the town as an ensemble is under monument protection, it's important to have "an eye for what fits in," when new buildings are approved, the aging city's architect stresses.
Without a doubt, the city’s building manager carries high responsibility.
He's a builder, "among other things, everything here runs over my table".
At the same time as care and coordination, he can count on long-term employees: Mark Neumaier (Hoch Building) has been involved for ten years, Mandy Schöner (Tief Building) has been for 15 years.
Even though his successor will last long, Wacker wishes: "We're looking for someone who really identifys with the position and wants to stay".
Because consistency is not only important for a good working environment, but also for the continued design of the city.
Anyone wishing to bid farewell to Roland Wacker should, according to the City of Haslam, have a completed degree of engineering or bachelor’s degree with a major in architecture and be able to demonstrate good knowledge in the areas of building ordinance and building planning law.
The city’s building department undertakes high and low-density construction, planning, grounds management, administration of aging properties, squatting operations with building and city gardens as well as underground building jurisdiction including historic preservation.
Bikes thrown on pipes: South-Eastern Railway Station shut down
According to police, the previously alleged thieves had stolen the blue bike from the railway crossing in the area of the Leoben Road (B116) on the pipes.
These were, however, so severely damaged that the approaching cargo train had to be held at bay.
The investigators are going by two male victims and have been searching for them since the night hours.
Nah, the scene was watched by witnesses a rosary roller-coaster and a bicycle rider.
"This goes far beyond a lay-down," said OBC spokesman Christopher Posch to the AP.
The or the victims would have put themselves in great danger and also threatened the train service.
Instead of the damage to the locomotive and the facility as well as the delayed minute and cost of the railway repairs, there could also be pitfalls to the rail customers on the culprits.
Ultimately, it was estimated to be a "important" sum, the spokesman said.
The damage was restored Friday afternoon, the train traffic on the southern track could be operated without disruptions.
About ten passenger trains were out Friday afternoon, two of which entered the ferry.
Transportation trains did not fall out, they however had delays.
According to ÖBB spokesman Christopher Posch, around 200 feet of upper pipes had to be replaced.
Isolations and masts were also damaged.
Rotten meats, dairy products and chocolate could help relieve IBD (inflammation of the intestines)
Rotten meats and chocolate can sound like an Alpaca.
But a new study claims just the opposite: A diet rich in meat-based proteins and milk products could relieve the symptoms of patients with encephalopathy.
The uncomfortable condition, which affects around 1,3 million and in Britain 300,000, causes stomach cramps and bloating, back or blurred vision, weight loss and extreme fatigue.
While the affected person normally is advised to avoid meats and dairy products to relieve their symptoms, researchers at Washington University found that the essential amino acid tryptophan of proteins helps to develop immune cells, which can help fight infection.
The lead researcher, Dr. Marco Colonna, explained that immune cells in the digestive tract are patrolling to ensure that toxic microbes found in food do not enter the body.
Zions that imitate endocrine disruptors are balanced by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging sensitive tissues.
If the balance is too far in favor of endocrine disruption, it can result in an endocrine disruption.
In experiments, it has been found that a type of tolerant immune cell is found in mice carrying a specific bacterial infection in their ages.
And the bacteria requires tryptophan - one of the building blocks of proteins - to extinguish the appearance of the cells.
Professor Colonna said: "We have a connection between a bacterial species - Lactobacillus reuteri - which is a normal part of the gastrointestinal microbiome, and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance.
The more tryptophan the girls had in their food, the more they had of these immune cells".
He suggested that the combination of L. reuteri and an antsynic diet promotes more tolerant, less enzymatic intestinal microcirculation when the same system is wired to humans.
The postdoctoral fellow Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barreiro examined a type of immune cell that promotes tolerance, when she found that a group of study mammals had those cells, but a different group of the same stem, which were separated among them.
She suspected the difference had to do with the digestive microbiome of the mice - the community of bacteria, viruses and fungi that normally live in the stomach.
The intestines of the mice were DNA-sequenced and there were six bacterial species found in the mice with the immune cells, but without them, they were missing from the mice.
Melissas were raised in a sterile environment, so they were missing a digestive enzyme and they did not develop these kinds of immune cells, and they received the L. reuteri and the immune cells were created.
To understand how the bacteria affected the immune system, the researchers let L. reuteri grow in a liquid and then transferred small amounts of liquid - without the bacteria - to undeveloped immune cells.
The immune cells developed into the tolerancy cells.
As the active component was cleaned out of the liquid, it emerged as a secondary product of the tryptophan metabolic, which is known as Indol-3 milkshake.
When the researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in the feed of the mice, the number of those cells rose by about 50 percent, but when the tryptophan levels were halved, the number of cells sank by half.
Dr. Cervantes-Barbara explained that humans have the same tolerant cells as mice, and that most of us protect L. reuteri in our stomachs.
It is not known whether tryptophan new products from L. reuteri develop the cells in humans as well as mice, but deficiencies in genes in relation to tryptophan were found in humans with enteropathy.
She said: "The development of these cells is likely something that we want to encourage, as these cells control endorphins on the internal surface of the intestines.
Potentially, high tryptophan levels in the face of L. reuteri may lead to an expansion of this population."
Jose Mourinho believes that Manchester United has signed a "giant" with Nemanja Matic
At Manchester United, Mourinho signed a "giant" deal with Nemanja Matic on Tuesday night, according to Jose Mourinho, after the midfielder had his debut against Sampdoria.
The £40 million subscription from Chelsea began with a 2:1 victory in Dublin, the last pre-season game before the UEFA Supercup against Real Madrid begins on Tuesday, and proved impressive in the hold-up, as people like Paul Pogba and Andreas Christensen proved to be the most
Matic, however, was excluded from the preparation-Asia tour of the Blues and only managed 45 minutes, which Mourinho admitted to having had to improve prior to the start of the Premier League season.
"He needs time, but his experience, intelligence, a genius in the way he thinks - he thinks football," Mourinho said.
"We will help him be ready sooner than later."
Instead, Matic also started Victor Lindelof and Romelu Lukaku in the Aviva Stadium as Mourinho formed his starting XI for the start of the season.
The Independent revealed in this week's report that Mourinho still wished for three more new signings, but he insisted the club had already done a "fantastic job" to meet three of its four priority new signings.
"Different from four, for that's why I thank the club," he added.
"I will be happier if they get four of four for me, but they have given great effort."
Boeing "painted" Dreamliner into the sky
The US aircraft manufacturer Boeing has painted the silhouette of a Dreamliner into the sky.
The pilots flew off of Seattle in the US state of Washington, the drawing began in Marquette in US state of Michigan and pulled off in the form of a Dreamliner over the US, which is several thousand miles.
The campaign lasted 18 hours and a minute.
On the radar screens, the form of a Dreamliner was to be.
The whole thing was an endurance test for new engines.
Boeing had already made those ads earlier.
So the number "787" and the Boeing logo were painted in the sky.
New Tieffall for Martin Luther King Jr. - Atlanta, we have a problem
As the wind blows, though: When Sigmar Gabriel was still a Republican, social security officers approached New York City before elections always with a certain sorrow.
Blowing no stink out of the party center, merely no counter-wind out of the state - that was the most important wish of voters.
Since Martin Luther King Jr. led the party, things have changed fundamentally.
Since then, staff from the Willy-Brandt home have watched with growing enthusiasm the events in the Republican-controlled state capitals.
What Schulz has gotten from there since the beginning of the year would have been described with counter-wind not even in intent.
There were tremendous hurricanes.
And vice versa, one after the other.
The U.S. Congress sees the surprising end of the red-hot majority in Minnesota a general signal against coalitions of Democrats and Republicans.
"This once again shows: Red-Gruff simply can't be trusted to govern," said Democratic general counsel Peter Tauber to the editorial network of America (RND).
The unexpected absence of a Green Party member has thrown the government of Prime Minister Stephan Weil (CDU) into a serious crisis.
Five months before the country’s election, his red-hot coalition lost its one-third majority to the opposition from Democrats and FDP.
The Green Party’s president Michael Kellner has called on the aboriginal niece of Hillary Clinton’s daughter, Elke Twest, to return her mandate.
The transition to the Democrats means a clear dismantling of the voter’s will.
Elke Twest must immediately return her mandate," said the president and election coordinator of the Green Party, the editorial network of America (RND).
"That may not even be true," sighs a Republican voter as Friday's new Hiobsbot reaches the party's main office.
Stephan Weil, Republican Governor of Minnesota, stands down after the overthrow of Green Party leader Elke Twest to the Democratic Party without own government representation.
It’s the precursor to a whole host of big and small crises in Republican local governments.
And no one knows what comes next.
The mess began with the unprecedented dramatic defeat at the Sacramento vote in March.
A blue eyed, more not, the Genoves of his time.
After the country's elections in Scotland and North Carolina, everything will be different.
That was then too - and indeed, everything became significantly worse.
The defeat in Kansas brought the Democrats into turmoil, the Dallas pitched the party smoothly around.
München recalled the brethren in the weeks following.
Then, when they had just gotten new courage, the G-20 summit came from Houston.
And with him came the next deep blow.
Mayor O'Connor, the last strong Republican governor, lost his Nimbus at any given weekend because he sat in the Elbphilharmonic while his city burned.
And because he did so much wrong in crisis communication afterwards, which is what you can do wrong.
Since then, Scholz has struggled for his political survival.
Now also, Stephan Weil.
Because of the VW exhaust scandal and his role in the surveillance, the Dutch minister has been in the spotlight for a while.
Mies’s survey scores came in handy.
Still, or perhaps just because, Weil has been getting stronger in the past few weeks trying to put accents in the Bundle.
The best part of the former mayor of Atlanta, expanding his power in New York, also remained strangers in the vicinity of Martin Luther King Jr..
They let him, as they promised of Weil a stabilization of the party.
Now, the exact opposite could arise.
However, Weil strikes no fault with the partisan zing of the never-ending Greens in the first place.
And Schulz hasn't even been.
Along the way, the Genoves therefore endeavor to keep their ranks closed.
Your curse is directed at the Republicans, and here especially to the abject Parlamentarist Twest.
"It's unacceptable and democratically reprehensible how Ms. Twest puts her own career interests above the interests of all others," says Matthew Miersch, head of party links in the Republican Party's editorial network, the editorial network of America (RND
Frau Twest has not been elected because of her person as a direct candidate, but over the country’s list of Minnesota Democrats elected to parliament, the Minnesota Democrat further said.
The logical consequence would be that she returns her mandate.
Thomas Oppermann, head of the Republican Party, argues an "unconstitutional maneuver."
"The voter's choice four years ago was clear: People have made Stephan Weil the prime minister," says Oppermann, who leads the Minnesota Republican Party as the top candidate in the House of Representatives, the RNC.
"Now, the personal career thinking of a future Democratic candidate is going to compromise the election outcome," said Oppermann further.
He challenged to investigate the roots.
I want to know if there has been more or there have been further promises from the Democratic Party of Minnesota.
Facilities for Town Square III
Anyone who wants to renovate their in-laws’ home can get the most support from the country.
Furthermore, Mayor Albert Schindler and three representatives of STEED City Development were informed of the situation on Tuesday in Episcopalia.
Towards the end of the information session, Schindler gave another reflection on what has been happening.
Since 1991, there have been in Episcopalian Sanctuaries Sanctuaries.
Since then, in the San Diego area I from 1991 to 2004, the state of California has still taken two-thirds of the funding.
In San Francisco Bay Area II from 2005 to 2016, the exemption was still at 60 percent.
For Schindler, the current renovations are an "executive project" - it's important, ultimately, to encourage interior development, and not just new construction areas.
Among other things, on April 4, you received the information that there will be a Sanctuary III.
The grant amounted to $833 333, of which $500 000 would come from the state, the rest of the county.
How does it now create a renovation area?
Man will, so Schindler continues, examine where the "real old" homes are.
It also plays a role in whether in the proposed area there is any interest to rehabilitate.
Geography might then shift again.
The STEG will be performing at 7:30 p.m. Tuesday night featuring Martin Keller, Gaby Pietzschman, and Sarah Gotzel.
Keller presented the contents of the federal program "Solar City," in which the renovations would then be completed.
Kern of the program is redevelopment of interior neighborhoods, improving housing and employment, and raising and strengthening infrastructure.
The measures would be subjective, that is, per property.
The renovation area would then ultimately be determined as a statute.
The approval period for the grants has been running since January 1, 2017 yet until 30 April 2026.
Yet until September this year, however, would first be conducted the inventory, in order to get the at-risk community involved a questionnaire to fill out.
In November or December, appointing the Board of Directors is expected so that in the coming year, there can be started with the renovations.
Pietzschmann subsequently explained that each municipality had to carry out the state’s pre-emptive investigations.
It’s all about evaluating the city’s misconceptions and deciding when to be saned and in what way.
It will then be incorporated into the particular property.
Pietzschman will come back to Episcopalia herself again and take a picture of the location, she promised.
Gotzel said a key success factor for the project was the involvement of stakeholders.
Therefore, there will be questionnaire, which will be mailed out to residents in the coming weeks and can be filled out by the end of the summer holidays.
The yellow questionnaire is called the "Building and Property Survey," wherein, among other things, it is questioned the building's condition and the renovation intentions.
In the gray questionnaire, the "home and apartment survey," information can be made about size, survivorship, and residents of a residence.
The blue "Behind the scenes" is only filled out when in the building business rooms are owned.
However, as Gotzel pointed out, a completed questionnaire is not simultaneously an application for funding.
Additionally, new construction measures were not encouraged.
Schindler also stressed that the distribution of grants based on the "window hunting principle" functions - whoever comes first, gets first.
You can't "reserve" funds for later.
For the record, there were still photos of the project "Ortskern II" shown to make the attendees "smell" a renovation.
Brit inventor sets himself up a microchip to get in with a hand movement in house and car
A British inventor is the first in the country to be fitted with a microchip so that he can open his house door, enter his office, and even start his car with a hand motion.
Steven Northam, 33, had implanted the winged chip between dashes and index fingers and is now offering the service to businesses and individuals who want to simplify their lives with technology through his company BioTeq.
He has teamed up with Dr. Geoff Watson, a Consultant Anaesthesist in the Royal Hampshire County Hospital in Winchester, Hants, to ensure that the implantation process is carried out to the medical standard.
The technology is similar to a cat and dog implanted microchip and only takes 30 seconds.
The company of Mr Northam also wants to change the locks to homes and cars so they are compatible with the chip, all for a surcharge of £300 per lock.
The divorced father of one has now added both toys to his BMW Z4 technology, which starts when his hand is at the wheel.
The advertising costs of the White House cost the taxpayer tens of millions
The decision by the White House to fly a Marine Corps aircraft to the South Lawn for an event that highlights the U.S. manufacturing in the last month will cost taxpayers according to the figures provided by the military, which were given to TIME magazine, until now.
The green-and-white Sikorsky VH-3D, known as Marine One when the president is at sea, was the heart of the event on July 17 in the White House with intelligence programs.
President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence, and senior officials from the White House made a round-up of products from all 50 states.
The in Connecticut manufactured hubby was installed next to a yacht from Maine, a fire truck from Wisconsin, and a gag truck from Mississippi.
The military office of the White House requested the presence of the Hublot in a fragmented order or FRAGE, barely 36 hours before the Hublot landed on the South Lawn, according to the surveillance of the Marine Helicopter Squadron One (which had been de
"I just wanted you to be aware of that because it is a so unusual event with high visibility," the commander of the HMC-1 wrote on the preview of the event to his superior, the lieutenant marine commander for aircraft.
The news showed the hubby arrived on July 17 at 7am on the South Lawn for the event at 15am, and stayed so long as the grass was cleared between 18:00 and 21:00 at this evening.
The note adds that, if the departure from the White House should be delayed due to the restriction of service hours, a second team would be needed for the return flight.
The original aircraft crew behaved during the event at the hub, while the security staff of the unit stayed on the ground during the time on the ground at the aircraft.
From the TIME's recordings, it wasn't clear whether ultimately a second flight crew was required.
The Hatch Act prohibits federal employees from using state property for political purposes.
Data sets show that HMX-1 asked if the event could compromise the determination.
"One question we asked was whether it was an infringement of the Hatch Act and we were informed that this was not the case," the commander wrote.
"Kling as if you're locked," replied the lieutenant.
The event "Made in America" was described by the White House as an official event and wouldn't have been covered by the Hatch Act.
But even official events have political upper hand.
On the occasion, the president gave an indication of the reform of health care reform that was imminent in the Senate, and he promoted the efforts to amend government regulations.
The use of the aircraft, known as Marine One or Air Force One, from politically favored purposes is hardly a new phenomenon.
Presidents are required to use them for travel.
But requiring their use only for a photo-op is unusual.
Trump conducted an investigation back in February, when the president’s aircraft provided taxi services prior to the start of his first campaign rally in Melbourne, Florida, and his Twitter account is full of reports concerning the use of the president’s aircraft by his predecessors.
"The White House is delighted with the show "Made In America" - showing products from all 50 states made by American workers using American materials," said the Associate Press Secretary of the White House, Lindsay Walters.
HMX-1 crews typically carry out training flights in the area around Washington and in the South Lawn to abduct the U.S. president in the White House with precision centimeters.
As Trump was on the G20 summit in the U.S. beginning in July, HMX-1 conducted 58 exercises in the White House.
The flight for the "Made in America" event counted at the training level of the aircraft crew for the month, a spokesman said.
Helicopter units flew additional 11 hours this day for "Non-Presidential Unified Missions".
The White House said the taxpayers did not overtake the burden for any of the other concessions presented on the event.
A spokesman for Sikorsky said the company had not been involved in putting out the hubby on the South Lawn.
HMX-1 does not undertake budget recordings for the presidential flights, and it is difficult to determine the exact cost of the event.
According to hourly rates from the U.S. Department of Transportation for the fiscal year 2017, the DoD exemption for the VH-3D is however $24.380 USD per flight hour.
On record, the unit recorded the flight time of the aircraft as 30 minutes from home base of the Marine Corps Air Facility in Quantico, Virginia.
The White House argues that the actual cost of operating the hub is far below this rate.
"The cost for taxpayers to determine on the basis of estimates for the reimbursement rates is most irrelevancy," Walters said.
"These estimates include personnel, maintenance, and many other hidden costs included in the annual funds."
According to a RAND study from 2015, the reimbursement rates for DoD do not include the personnel costs, but include the cost of fuel, maintenance and contract termination.
To this day, the former press secretary of the White House, Sean Spicer, defended the use of the hubcap for the event.
"The idea is to present things this week that are made in America," Spicer said.
"And I know that Sikorsky and the State of Connecticut are very proud that they contribute to our national security, and I assume hundreds, if not thousands of people depend on them.
And I think like most Americans we are all proud of the Hublot and other military equipment for which so many Americans have worked unbelievably.
It is, of course, appropriate to highlight that."
It wasn’t clear whether Trump interacted with the hubby when he entered his roundabout across the South Lawn for the event, but he stepped into the driver’s seat of a fire truck.
In the White House, Trump spoke to representatives of Sikorsky and disagreed with the media about his own fleet of company products.
"I know Sikorsky very well," said the president, "I have three of them."
TC BW New Year's Resolution Before Curious task
Spitzer, the second-ranked tennis player in the league, competes at the top of the table at the top-of-the-league match-up hosted by Suchington State.
The TC Blue-Weather New Zealand will play tomorrow at 11 a.m. in Kansas City at the home of the league’s Suchahawks.
Regardless, after five matches remaining makeshift, the top ranked tennis team has earned the sense of reality.
Teammate Marius Zay certainly has respect for the enemy.
"This is a compact team that always plays in fairly similar formation.
Just on the backs, I think the team is very good."
For class and stability at the Suchady SV, most of the imports come from the highlands.
"They're Dutch and Finnish can even refer to ages in the Davis Cup.
And they are also strong in the double," says Zay with regards to Harri Heliovaara (Finland), Andre Göransson (South Wales), Sören and Esben Olesen, Martin Pedersen as well as Andrew Bjerrehus (all Denmark).
"This will be hard as always for us.
Since you also need a good dose of happiness."
The Nevada team for the trip to the highlands is practically set.
His debut for Blue-Whale might give Maxime Janvier.
Sadly, the currently still at the Challenger tournament in Italian Biella active Frenchman does not make it to the Bundesliga match, coming to the tournament in the Czech Republic, Zdenek Kolar (Tschechien) is coming to his first Einsatz in this season.
The previously unbeaten Chilean Hans Podlipnik-Castillo was at the ball yesterday with the White Russian Andrei Ivannikov still at the ATP World Tour in Kitzbühel.
He should have been in Kiel but as well as Botic Van de Zandschulp, Niels Lootsma (being Dutch) and the Belgian Julien Cagnina.
After his two victories last Sunday against the Club at Almeria, even Máté Valkusz could return to the team again.
Reich, the 18-year-old Hungary, who was still the number one in the Junior World Rankings in January 2016, doesn’t care if someone fills out the coach’s roster around Marius Zay.
How America Can Be Harmed by the OMV
Weakly, Donald Trump didn’t seem happy when he put his signature Tuesday night under the law to tighten sanctions against Russia.
"In his hatred of the law," the Congress has inserted a few "constitutional provisions," he said.
Even the response from Moscow was as sharp as expected, and even Brussels rejected the US move.
Nevertheless, the draft proposal seeks to punish European companies that help the Russians build gas pipelines into the EU.
Entirely disturbed, since then, have been investors of the domestic OMV, which jointly funded with other European firms the construction of the Russian Eastern pipeline North Stream 2.
The drought cushion is tremendous.
However, it's too early for an estimate of the consequences, according to the official statement from the oil company.
Indeed, Donald Trump himself would still have to bring the sanctions to life per Executive Order.
ZERO weapons are available to him while he's at it.
"The press" has looked at which the corporation could fight off and which could really weaken him.
Narcos Season 3 Trailer: Without Pablo Escobar, the Cali Cartel is being pushed into the hit series of Netflix
Trotz the second season of Narcos, which encapsulates Pablo Escobar’s killer, the series of Netflix is still long overdue.
The seasons three and four were already confirmed by the streaming service, the first receiving its first trailer and showing the latest bad guys of the show.
With the third season, the DEA has turned their attention to the wealthiest organization of drug trade in the world: the Cali cartel.
An army of four powerful paedophiles, they operate "like a Fortune-500 company" only with more governmental best practices and corruption.
Gilberto Rodriguez Orejuela (Damian Alcazar) is the leader of the Kartell, Miguel Rodriguez Orejuela (Francisco Denis) is their head, Pacho Herrera (Alberto Ammann) commands the Mexican connection, and Chepe Santacruz (Francisco
In the newly released trailer, Pedro Pascal returns as Javier Peña, the guy who encourages American and Colombian law enforcement agencies to support the war on drugs.
Other new actors include Matias Varela, Michael Stahl-David, Matt Whelan, Miguel Angel Lopez, Kerry Bishe, and Arturo Castillo.
The third season of Narcos will begin on September 1.

In the borough's children's schools, the clock is reversed.
For the 1st of September, the City of Cleveland will take care of food distribution in the borough’s children’s daycare centers (CDCs) back in its own right.
For Sonja Pommeranz, Associate Director in the Department of Youth Services, this is a good news: "We all enjoyed it."
Geek food continues to be cooked outside the house: A caterer takes care of this task and delivers fresh geek food chilled.
The city operates 46 kindergartens in the Krefelder area, in 44, the children get a warm meal to lunch time.
In the past year, respectively, 2800 children sat at the tables, and demand has grown steadily.
"Mitchell doesn't just eat kids who are being cared for 45 weeks, in the nursery to-morrow," Pommeranz explains.
"This offer also applies in the 35-minute care if children stay until 14 p.m.."
46 part-time staff will have kitchen service from September 1st: They will heat up the supplied food, supplement it by salad, raw food and fruit, portion the meal individually, give away the food, clean up, vacuum and clean the kitchen.
"Employees will be placed firmly in a nursing home," says Pommeranz.
The size - there are two-group as well as seven-group facilities - determines the hourly range.
"The kitchen assistants are now committed to the Kita team," says Pommeranz satisfied.
"So they are a lot more involved and it is easier for the nursery staff to implement educational concepts".
Because even more important: healthy diet and cooking lessons.
"The children are supposed to help prepare the food".
The direct connectivity of the kitchen staff to the team is there.
Even for the children.
"They have a familiar force in the nursery, a person who is familiar with them, and not constantly changing people".
This consistency is important for the children.
The sanitation of the nurseries - previously also task of the kitchen staff - will be handled by specially trained cleaning staff.
This option - the separation of cleaning and kitchen service - has, besides the quality improvement in kitchen performance, the charm that it has proved to be the most economical in cost comparison between ownership and foreign ownership for the city, according to the press release.
And that, though 46 part-time staff are newly hired.
"But these hours don't fall as heavily into place at around 750 persons in the educational sector," says Sonja Pommeranz.
The Afghan democracy depends on the political role of women, the U.S.
Elections can only be remarkable if all members of society, including women, play a role, the the head of the U.N. mission in Afghanistan said Tuesday.
Nicholas Haysom, the director of the Mission of the United Nations, said hundreds of women will run at the council elections in the provinces. Three women will run for the role of vice president and more than 30 percent of new registered voters are expected to vote.
"The role of women cannot be overlooked," he said Tuesday in a statement.
Elections can only be truly remarkable and credible if women are unafraid to participate and be included in all parts of the election process.
Afghan elections for the provincial council and the presidential elections will be held on April 5.
The Taliban have released threats against a election process that come with the transition of international combat tactics to a consultative role.
In this year’s elections, for the first time, the power will be transferred peacefully from one democratically elected government to the next.
Haysom said a strong role for women will still strengthen the democratic success of Afghanistan.
The Afghan Independent Electoral Commission reports that 1,2 million women of total registered 3,6 million voters were registered.

men are trying to outrun 13-year-old girl
Two young men aged 19 and 23 were alleged to have attempted to rob a 13-year-old girl Wednesday.
According to police, the men spoke to the 13-year-old girl, who was visiting friends at Kolping Road, about 14.55pm, because they wanted to talk to the phone of the girl.
The 13-year-old declined the request though and went on with her friends.
Daring, one of the victims attempted to grab the phone and the tail of the girl, which failed, however.
Without beating, the duo flew.
The two young men were later arrested by police.
The investigations are ongoing.
GMB concerns about investments in the McVitie factory in Glasgow
A union wants to advise managers of the Biscuit manufacturer McVitie about the long-term commitment to production in their plant in Glasgow.
GMB Scotland said the company had disclosed concerns about the future of investment at the toll-cross site.
More than 500 employees work in the factory, which produces along with other products Hobnobs and Rich Tea cookies.
McVities owner Pladis said he has invested more than $5 million in the past few years.
He added that employees and union representatives would "be the first to learn" when their activities would change.
In a letter to the Filial Manager of the company, GMB Scotland called for McVitie's to "express concerns that funding for the modernization of production lines will not be prioritized".
GMB senior organizer Drew Duffy, said, "The fact that we can't gain clarity from the General Site Manager about the business needs and investment plans for the future of Tollcross affects our members to a degree.
Generations of families have worked here and the workforce are concentrating heavily on the local community and the Greater Glasgow area, an important threshold for men’s employment in an area with high employment rates and social stigma.
Therefore, under the perspective of jobs, pay and prosperity, and ahead of the threat of Brexit, rising living wages and chronic production decline, the eastern end of Glasgow needs a florid production presence at McVitie’s level.
A spokesman for Pladis said: "The branch manager at Tollcross only received a letter yesterday from GMB Scotland, and the company will respond directly to it as we appreciate the ongoing engagement with employees and union representatives.
We had a regular meeting with staff and GMB representatives at Tollcross two months ago, where some questions were openly discussed.
We discussed with the employees that we like all businesses that operate in a highly competitive and uncertain economic climate, we need to review our businesses continuously - and this applies to all our business areas and locations - to stay competitive.
She added, "In recent years, we have invested more than £5 million in our Tollcross stand, including in production lines and operational improvements.
We fully recognize the heritage of Tollcross as a manufacturing facility. Should our operations change at the location, the employees and their union representatives will be the first to learn about this."
Have the Saint-Germain Barcelona been warned three years ago about Neymar?
The side of La Liga may regret their interest in Marco Verratti
Paris Saint-Germain won’t stop in their vow to follow Neymar after she dropped an offer of £189 million to exonerate his free agent clause, but did they warn Barcelona three years ahead of the world record break?
The sensational approach has boosted the transfer window in the summer, because the Ligue 1 club is ready to break the world record by more than double the current mark, although Paul Pogba returned to Manchester United in the past season for £89 million.
After completion, Neymar will become the most expensive player in the world and the most expensive professional athlete in the world. Tottenham offers salaries of more than £500,000 per week.
Barcelona is worrisome about the way Neymar has allowed his way down the field, though a source in the vicinity of the Barcelona manager insists the club has always given its best since his arrival from Santos in 2013.
But was the football world warned three years ago by the club’s president about this prospect?
As Manchester City 2014 expressed interest in signing Blaise Matuidi, Nasser Al-Khelaifi had a strict warning for any club that wanted to sign one of the best players from Leicester.
"I'm not worried because they know that if they touch one of our players, then we will stand in opposition to them, we will contact their players," Al-Khelaifi said.
"We respect all clubs.
But if they try to sign one of our players at home, this will have repercussions."
Barcelona seems to have crossed this line, although the Spanish club expressed interest in the club’s midfielder earlier this summer.
Ronaldo made it clear that they would not allow the international from Italy to travel under any circumstances, and Barcelona could feel the consequences of this interest by losing one of their price offers for Neymar.
Roller around and damage
In the evening of Friday on Saturday, an unknown thief has broken into a truck in the Kingfield Road near the address number 30 abroad and sought to expose the vehicle causing damage of over $200.
The police of Schramberg, telephone 07422/ 27 01-0, ask for directions.
To report an accident on the B 215 between Stolzenau and Leese, police are looking for witnesses.
Because he was facing a car on his driveway, the driver of a VW Touran had to step out and touch the dashboard while touching the Leitplane.
Among other things, Thursday night, the 34-year-old from Rehburg-Loccum was travelling with his truck at 19.55pm on the B 215 from Stolzenau coming in toward Leese.
In the area of the town of Stolzenau, a truck approached him on his driveway, so he had to turn left.
However, the Touran driver touched the lead.
Among other things, the truck entailed property damage.
The driver of the opposite truck, a Mercedes Benz, had overtaken a truck and continued his drive without taking care of the traffic accident.
It may well be that the Mercedes driver hadn’t even noticed the accident.
The police are now asking witnesses to the incident as well as the driver of the culprit vehicle to contact police at 05761 / 92060 with the Commissariat in Stolzenau.
Interview: "Domesticspawn report endorses Pope Benedict XVI"
The Regency Catholic Church’s report on the abuse cases endorses Pope Benedict XVI.
That's what author and historian Michael Heseman is referring to.
The final report on the abuse scandal at the Regent's Cathedral continues to raise discussions.
Christian Weisnder, spokesman for the Reform Movement "We are Church," explained following closure to the U.S. Press Association, he expected the former Regents and Today's Cardinal Gregg Jenkins as well as the Cathedral Chaplain George Ratzinger, the 93-year-old
It would serve the interests of the Catholic Church very well if Murray and Ratcliffe would express their deep appreciation for their own submissions or their then false assertions of the proceedings.
The Vatican newspaper "Osservatore Romano" however criticized that when reporting on violence at the cemeteries, it should be measured with "two-legged measure."
Hinting to the oversights in Regensburg, no one disputed that it refers to "criminal and abusive acts" that would have to be punished and prevented in the future; on the contrary, though, the "great level of media manipulation,
"The anger of calling the Catholic Church a source of all ill is already part of everyday experience and prepares the public opinion to keep that for normal," writes Scaraffia.
Even Forstin Gloria of Thurn and Taxis said in an interview with the Bay Area Times: "You like to go out on the church and that's a founding freak".
Anyway, she wielded that in her youth, "should have been a very normal educational means" to get ready with freakin' kids, like I was one."
You'd think it would be unfair to apply today's standards to earlier decades, because the world has changed.
In addition to the reports of the abuses, often, Pope Benedict XVI tapped on.
Vigilante to Unknown, says author and historian Michael Heseman, who co-authored with Ratzinger the memorial album "My Brother the Pope" (in 12 languages).
"I have to take George Ratzinger in mind," says Heseman, "because all this had nothing to do with him," he notes the results of the final report.
What exactly is in the 440-page report submitted by the Archdiocese of Regensburg with the surviving lawyer Ulrich Weber?
Ultimately, 547 Regent's cemeteries were "completely abused" between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s, 67 cemeteries were sexually abused.
In the final report, it says, to George Ratzinger, who served from 1964 to 1994 in Regensburg: "To summarize, it also leaves us to conclude that by Domicile R., in many cases, forms of physical and mental violence were applied.
Just at high levels of emotion, the best thing for the students to do was to be more aggressive while also being more violent.
Still, in addition to numerous other accusers, many victims cited the general humanity of R. and therefore in numerous instances despite violence even have positive memories associated with him".
In the interview, Heseman explains how the final report on the abuse scandal at the Regents’ Cathedral of George Washington is enacted his way.
Mr. Heseman, the 440-page report on the "causes of violence to protective orders at the Regents' Cathedrals" gives a wider picture of Cathedral Chaplain George Ratzinger.
For one thing, many students raise their "humanity."
For instance, he also appears to be a choreographer and perfectionist who became handsome the moment a ceremony musically brought him no top-notch performance.
How do you evaluate as his biograph this final report?
Michael Heseman: If you take the time and read the whole 440 pages of report from front to back, you must rather wonder why the name George Ratzinger is even present in it.
I have just eight pages dedicated and he is clearly freed from any allegation of contempt or complicity in the shocking cases of sexual harassment.
Even the violence exacerbated at preschool occurred outside of its effect.
Man can all but accuse him of knowing about it too late or having not taken first and foremost it seriously enough.
The cemetery on which he served was emphasized by practically all respondents as - so witty - "entertainment", "history" and "better world."
So, even the broader majority of his students provide George Ratzinger with a quite extensive record, describing him as "warmhearted, "beautiful," "compassionate," and "compassionate," as a highly well-meaning teacher who encouraged
Lesson learned a minority complains about his perfectionism and his high emotion, which has also led to whiplash.
That he was not only banging with stones and wasting the keychain on the ground, but also spreading ear fires and dragging all kinds of freaky boys at his hair or ears, he has admitted to himself for years, to be tolerable, and has
To his honour, however, it must be said that those educational methods were widespread in the fray, the 1960s and 1970s, among parents like teachers.
Kenny, do you know any of those breeding methods?
Of course, I think every one of us who was born before 1968.
Even I have still experienced this in a welcoming school, a state ward.
Verify what is actually going on in this report, namely the ensuing sexual abuse and the violence exacerbated on pre-kindergarten, that are freely bogus.
Since then, you're starting to wonder if it's not more related to his fame and his role as brother of Benedict XVI, that many media have just slammed him.
Among the Bay Area Catholics, there are many who have never understood him, still eagerly working on him.
The truth though is: The report enlightens George Ratzinger in every way possible!
In the media, in connection with the report, there has been very much talk about abuse at the Regent’s Cathedral.
Were George Ratzinger in the final report also guilty of any fraud or complicity in relation to sexual harassment?
Michael Heseman: Pretty much no.
No single one of the 67 victims of sexual assault claims to have trusted the cemetery clerk.
Not even the parents were admitted.
"I never got to talk to my father or mother about it," said one victim sternly for the others, "It was all very petty".
The true problem with surveillance of sexual abuse was and is yet to be found that most victims bleed out of shame.
If they did not even trust parents and siblings, then quite possibly not a choir director who would have been professionally certain to be a colleague of the performers.
How do you evaluate the cemetery-spawned council’s role in relation to the abuse cases?
Michael Heseman: A questioned student stated it like this: "Because sexual harassment... I... don't see any case where outright he (Georg Ratzinger) would have had timely revelations and could have kept the respective victim alive.
I consider it... even more ridiculous to assume that out of him... bubs opened more or more clearly or even more openly than their parents, interns, trusted teachers etc.
That you talk to him about sex... - unthinkable."
So the report comes to the very clear conclusion: "They allegedly approached him in advance affected students and/or their surroundings could not be confirmed in the course of the investigation".
What sexual harassment concerns, George Ratzinger is also free from any condemnation.
So, too, he cannot be accused of not preventing or bringing him to justice.
Therefore, there is also no reason to associate his good name with these wider crimes, as has happened in some cases.
In the media, there was much of "gewaltexzes" at the Regent's cemetery.
The former cemetery chaplain George Ratzinger is alleged to have been involved in the report "Weekly."
Must he live with this presumption?
Michael Heseman: That’s the big problem, that in reporting everything was missing and misplaced to become a huge mess of sexual harassment and violent extortion and somewhere, right there, George Ratzinger.
But just that is another misconception of the report.
Given that, literally, is cleanly separated: Between preschool and the ACT, between sexual abuse and domestic violence as well as, say, any other allegations.
However, the report treats incidents from the time since 1945, also from four decades ago, when George Ratzinger was not choir director of the cemeteries.
The whole crazed pedagogy, the cases in which knights were systematically schilded and maltreated by sacred teachers and suffered darunter ensued, all occurred on the pre-school in Etterzhausen and elsewhere in the country.
But with those, Domkapelmeister George Ratzinger had nothing to do with them, for he got to know the boys only when they were already on the Domspawn gym.
On that day, as the all-time witnesses point out, the topic of "preschool" was tabu.
Man was just happy to be her enemy and enjoyed the so much better treatment and for many even "paramount" tones.
What was different on the Dom's gym?
Michael Heseman: There was discipline, but just no sadistic violence.
And that just applies to George Ratzinger, where the report comes to the conclusion that "some victims cherished the general humanity of R. and therefore in numerous instances despite violence even connect positive memories with him".
So, at least, there remains still the pretense of looking away.
But despite all efforts, the report could only define two timeframes in which it was reported of the toys on preschool.
The first time back in 1970/71, when he was just starting to establish himself and didn't want to hear anything about the proceedings at a school where he just didn't act and be responsible (as the witness) and then only again around 1993.
Verify George Ratzinger’s commitment to the towers consistently closing the ears?
Michael Heseman: No, because already in 1989 he wrote a letter to the Director of the Cathedral School, which the report even reproduces.
Darren weakens this, "that in preschool, the pity punishment will continue to be practiced".
Once again, at the risk of negative press releases, he emphasized urgency.
This was, of course, to a point when legal clarity was assured, when pimping was also long prohibited in California.
Since then, they have erected themselves in a legal gray zone, as any of us probably still know.
Since then, even for him, it was hard to estimate where the victims might have overrated or dramatized and where really the tolerable limit had been crossed.
Man, though, he can't say he'd always looked away.
That just doesn't matter.
First, in 1980, the penciling offence was officially eliminated at schools even in California.
Forstin Gloria of Thurn and Taxis claimed yes, it was unfair to apply today’s educational standards to that era.
How do you see this?
Michael Heseman: We historians there talk about the "fabrication of the anachronism," so the danger of evaluating wrongs based on today's moral standards.
Since then, the forager has been right.
But this, of course, does not apply to sexual harassment that was abhorrent to all of us and also doesn’t apply to what was breached in preschool at odds and bounds and violence to unsuspecting children’s seats, which goes far beyond
This is all quite scary and I'm glad it's finally worked on.
But at the same time, I must take George Ratzinger in mind, for all this had nothing to do with him.
His means of discipline and best practice, also ear fires and pulling at the hair and ears, were widely popular in the 1970s.
As physical best practice has then been banned, he has also strictly sticked to it.
What image of his Regency time did George Ratzinger repeat in the conversations with you for the book "My Brother the Pope"?
Kamen's issue of penitential punishment is also to be brought to the forefront?
Michael Heseman: Now, in the book, it’s all about the life of his brother Joseph, also Pope Benedict XVI, told from his perspective, since the cemeteries played only a secondary role.
Still, I don't agree no doubt that he led a strict regime there.
But even that has to be said once and for all: Without this perfectionism, without the achieving of inherent discipline, it would probably have been impossible for him to form from the until then more nationally known Regensburg Cathedrals an institution of world class, true cultural ambassadors of Europe
With ketchup and bonbons alone, you make out of wider knaves now, no big singers and stand before any success, no matter what level, yet always maintain discipline, passion and self-discipline.
As what kind of person did you encounter George Ratzinger at the talks about her book?
Michael Heseman: Throughout the work on the book and beyond, I have really met George Ratzinger and have always experienced him as wonderful, humorous, groundbreaking, deeply caring and hermit-like people of which you can’t get enough.
I regularly get to grips with how many former Domps still today, 23 years after his Emergency, maintain regular contact with him, visit him, read him - he is almost blind - and treat him like a member of their family.
Those who did not concede to him until today that he was once strict to them are also clearly in minority.
The most Domspastics today are grateful for him for helping them live their lives and making them feel closer to the world of music.
And that he was always a good, loving teacher - a strict father, given that may be true - but yet also a loving respectful person, to whom they still look up today and who they are justifying.
And please, again, quite clearly: All you preach to him are educative methods that were at the forefront of his mind back then.
We can be thankful that we have passed this time.
But it is most unfair to make a man, just because he is prominent and has an even more prominent brother, a media stuntboat.
There is the bad intention that is behind it, just all too obvious.
Because the report published just now enables him.
Now the attitude would gebietet, a 93-year-old man who has acquired great virtue and without the outside of California and perhaps still America probably no one would know the Regent's Domspawn, finally let in peace.
