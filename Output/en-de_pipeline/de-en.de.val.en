b'The NAACP Travel Advisory for the State of Missouri, which is due to come into force on August 28, 2017, urges African American travelers, visitors and Missourians to pay attention when traveling through the state and to take extreme caution as a result.'

b'The Mayor Thomas Schneider was clear: "The City has recognized the importance of the wetland project and is pleased with the Leader\'s support".'
b'The cost of $3,000 to $4,000 per hectare would have to be supported by the farmers.'

b'"The greatest blessing we have is the people who work in the farming industry and are thinking about how to keep their business going," the Mayor said.'
b'The farmers are often placed in the spotlight because of the funding often'

b"The White House takes the liberty of Trump's freedom of speech"
b'The sure sign of a Regime weakness is when they start attacking the stainless steel.'
b'The Americans appreciate this as much as anyone else - hence the carefully orchestrated Sturz of Saddam Hussein on the Firdos Platz in Bagdad in 2003.'
b'The Miller, one of the key ideologues of the Trump administration, certainly knew what he was doing when he used a symbolic axe in a fierce debate with Jim Acosta of CNN about the proposals of the President to drastically restrict legal immigration with to freedom of speech.'
b'It\xe2\x80\x99s fair to say that Miller didn\xe2\x80\x99t touch the statue himself.'
b'The horde of boat owners and Liberty Impressionists would have killed him if he had done it.'
b'I hesitantly pointed to its significance, and especially the significance that was given to it when the famous poem of Emma Lazarus 1903, 17 years after the completion of the monument, was added to its baseline.'
b'The Miller Acosta commented: "I don\'t want to go on a complete thing about history, but the freedom statue is... a symbol of American freedom that illuminates the world.'
b'"The poem you refer to is later added and is not part of the original freedom statue."'
b"I think that's sarcastic, but as he himself put it, it's not really about history."
b'It\'s about the time-honored resemblance with the onlookers\' words of Lazarus, the only ones in which a state doesn\'t just invite any old arrivals, but the troubles of the poor: "Dearest, your poor, / your'
b'It was never a time when the "earthquake" was seen better on our screens.'
b"The author didn't engage in literary criticism - he made clear that these people weren't welcome in Trump's America."
b'The conflict because of the significance of a statue is part of a broader political and cultural debate:'
b'Theus - and her friends who volunteered to put their words forward after her death at the base - knew very well that they were carrying out a high-profile action.'
b'The sculpture should showcase the connections between French and American republicanism by presenting in an abandoned classical imagery the weasel representation of freedom.'
b'It changed this meaning: in her poem, the weasel figure is no longer abstract - she has received a voice.'
b'I give her herself a whole other name: Mother of Exiles.'
b'The connection of the poem with the picture is a brilliant feminist co-operation and a tremendous attack on the American nativeness.'
b'The exact same way Lazarus changed the significance of the statue, the people from the right flank wanted to reverse this for a long time.'
b'The great scourge of Rush Limbaugh, a sort of Johannes of the T\xc3\xa4ter for the coming of Trump, argued 2010, that the freedom statue shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t attract anyone\xe2\x80\x99s attention, but rather be an early neoconservative that brings the atlantic flame into the'
b'I shall carry the flag of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world.'
b'"The fence does not illuminate the way into the United States."'
b'The strangest thing is Limbaugh is here on something.'
b'The significance of the statue is entirely and a matter of standpoint.'
b'The great phenomena of Lazarus consisted in seeing them as they were seen by the elderly, but hopeful people after long and often scary voyages on the ships of ships.'
b'It\xe2\x80\x99s in the true sense of looking at the world from the perspective of people who are looking for refuge and a chance to improve their lives.'
b'The statue speaks to them the words of hope and welcome they must hear.'
b'This is obviously not the perspective that Miller and Trump would ever want to associate with.'
b"I don't want to illuminate the way, but the hatred that is their only source of power."

b'"My captain\'s remarks were incredible," says Black. "I\'m so proud of you. "'
b'"A number of athletes, no matter if they were Scots or wherever they lived or trained, went out of the room and felt very proud and were very motivated.'
b'"The passion and the genuine feeling that embraced me quite naturally were amazing."'
b'The Commonwealth silver medal winner, who will be at her fifth World Championships at the 400m hills, says it\'s "unfortunate" that 16 Scots are in the British team.'
b'The UK\xe2\x80\x99s best overall number of athletes at the World Championships was seven, which were achieved in 1983 and 2015.'
b'In the middle of the race, Muir leads on this one and has set five British and two European records.'
b'I will be participating in the 1.500 m and the 5.000 m races.'
b"The O'Hare, who runs 1.500 metres, is another shoe you should be watching after a fantastic season that included the victory at the British Team Trials and the Anniversary Games."
b'This reminds me of my first World Championships when the only other cheerleader in the team was Lee McConnell.'
b'The team\'s captain says she\'s "enormously proud" of the fact that many of her descendants are not only part of the team, but in some cases will be involved in the medals and at the Finals.'
b'The special thing about being team captain is that she was chosen by the other members of the team, so it was probably a great honor, but knowing that my teammates voted for me and voted for me makes it feel like something special.'
b'"Offensively, I\'m very proud of all the cheers that come to the team.'
b"I just show you how far we've come."
b'It\xe2\x80\x99s because they\xe2\x80\x99re here as established athletes, athletes who want to climb on polls.'
b'This is my speech as a captain?'
b'You know, I think she went well.'
b'I just wanted to mention that we are in this situation very happy as we have a home team championship.'
b'It\xe2\x80\x99s also really important to put on this home support and benefit from being back in the Olympics.'

b'The influencing of critics over Facebook: Don\xe2\x80\x99t apply for a public office if you can\xe2\x80\x99t resist the influencing of voters'
b'The father of our country knew something of bad press.'
b'The Americans loved George Washington, but it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t until the newspapers shouted him down because of everything, from the interior politics to his political principles.'
b'It was schizophrenic at the time, sure.'
b"I don't think he has brought his critics to silence."
b'"In 1783, Washington said: "The speech may be taken away - and, dumb and stubby, we shall be led like the sheep to the slaughter."'
b'This brings me to Maryland to Governor Larry Hogan who needs to work hard to be more like Washington.'
b'The company has blocked the posts of at least 450 people who expressed their opinion on its official Facebook page.'
b'The American Civil Liberties Union filed suit against him earlier this week.'
b'The S\xc3\xadoch\xc3\xa1na ended the suit as frivolous, and the online commentary was full of a counterargument with "Na, and?".'
b'"It\'s just Facebook," many people said.'
b"I think it's important."
b'It\xe2\x80\x99s especially important if it\xe2\x80\x99s a type like Hogan.'

b'I have the two-thirds approval of the 50 governors of the nation.'
b"I'm not a reactionary heat gun."
b'I have a firm hand in leading his country and strictly following the principles.'
b'It was also very bold to use Facebook as a prized medium to connect with his voters and playfully depict his hairy head after chemotherapy on his side.'
b"The blocking of individuals coming on to the side of the governor's side - which is a public forum that is called official and run by employees paid with public tax dollars - is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous."
b'In an interview with The Washington Post, Hogan\xe2\x80\x99s spokeswoman Amelia Chasse defended the actions of the governor and argued that blocking the comments was nothing more than a moderation.'
b'It\xe2\x80\x99s too easy to use the image of trolls or spammers or hassle-free people who are online the peeping.'
b'The Post spoke with some of the real people who were blocked by Hogan.'
b'This is just real people talking with their chosen leaders: a teacher, a businessman and a pastor, no trolls.'
b'I all agreed that their comments were respectful, after-thoughtful and not profane.'
b'The pastor quoted the Bible in his post and appealed to Hogan\xe2\x80\x99s Catholic faith.'
b'The attorney-at-law Lakshmi Sarma Ramani of Bowie, Md. It was not hassle-free, but she asked for hate crimes.'
b'"I commented sternly that I was disappointed that there was no response to hate crimes and other current news," she wrote in the comments section of the news show "The Post".'
b'"I don\'t agree with this idea either, if a number of people take up the same issue, then they will be misunderstood by some rather than a so-called collective effort and not recognized as a large group of affected citizens".'
b'The staff of the governor\'s office called it a "constitutional spade attack". Others would probably call it "fake news."'
b'The Facebook algorithm makes it easy to cut off a message by simply blocking a critic or delete a negative comment.'
b'This is much cleaner than in earlier times when you would have done the same thing, that employees were enlisted to collect newspapers with critically-charged Leitartikels and to burn or arrest protesters and bring them to silence.'
b'The exact same thing is happening right now digitally.'
b"I'm not the first public figure to be criticised for criticizing Facebook and other social media."

b"It shouldn't be that hard."
b'The time of Washington had a similar effect on the Internet.'
b'The number of newspapers declined between 1776 and 1800, and anonymous letter writers threw on his leadership.'
b'I myself remember when Washington had anonymous trolls.'
b'The people who used pseudonyms such as "Juricola", "Valerius", "Belisario" and "Portius" wrote all the letters to newspapers that kept Washington\'s decisions secret.'
b'The Petitions, which challenged his stand on the Agreement of Amity, the Handel and the Shipping with Britain, overwhelmed his administration, according to the historical documents collected from the online papers of the George Washington Project.'

b'It has been previously reported that a number of customers have cancelled their initial reservation already.'
b'In addition to the always triumphant numbers to revenue growth and yet gigantic sales targets, Tesla CEO Elon Musk at the announcement of the latest quarterly earnings report revealed a different, less glamorous number: the number of cancellations at the new mass market model.'

b'The maker points out that of the total 518,000 pre-orders, 63.000 have already been cancelled.'

b'"Unlike previous administrations, the EPA has often failed to meet the deadlines for execution and then waited to be challenged by activist groups and others, and in a meeting to set the date for execution," Pruitt said, who represents the EPA'
b'"We don\'t believe in regulation by court processes, and we take deadlines seriously.'
b'"We also take the law and authority it gives us seriously."'

b'The New York metropolitan area included in this case California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New York, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington and the District of Columbia.'
b'The-Ozone occurs when contaminants from cars, power plants, oil refineries, chemical plants and other sources in the atmosphere react to sunlight.'
b'The resulting smoke can cause sensitive groups of people serious ailments, and contribute every year to hundreds of pregnancy deaths.'
b'The public health sector and environmentalists shouted over Pruitt\xe2\x80\x99s unexpected course of action.'

b'The next time there\'s a bullet hole thrown by "Roger", almost everyone in the audience threw out very real seats.'
b"The 2005 film brings citizens to Moore's Ford Bridge to commemorate the night after the night in which two black couples - Roger and Dorothy Malcom as well as George and Mae Murray Dorsey - were murdered by the Ku Klux Klan in 1946."
b'I have never been accused of murder.'
b'"It\'s really unfortunate that in all these years, no one has been arrested - though we see them in our churches, though we know who they are," said Tyrone Brooks, who helps organize the aftermath.'
b'"It\'s a scratch on a story, but it\'s a burden on our souls."'

b'A decade ago, Cassandra Greene led the annual aftermath of the Moore Ford Bridge Lynch Moriarty.'
b'The presentation is atmospheric, emphasizes and is grounded in a kind of deep-rooted racism, of which many believe that he no longer exists in America.'
b'It\xe2\x80\x99s hard to watch, and even more difficult to look away, but Greene said that\xe2\x80\x99s the point.'
b'"We don\'t want to talk about the lynch because we\'re going to be faced with its presence in us all," she said.'
b'"But I can\'t build a relationship with you if you don\'t want to listen or don\'t want to hear what I\'ve been through."'

b'Ide Marbaugh is here Greenes co-director.'
b'I have been playing the role of the chief clan member for years, but he said the role will never be easy.'
b'"I feel sick because I\'m not so," said Marbaugh.'

b'"No," said Greene, still kissing.'
b'"I just don\'t believe that white people were saying \'n --- he\'."'
b'"Dad," witted one of the other black characters.'
b'"You just have to hit the hardest \'R. "'
b'In just that moment, the energy shifts in the room, a feeling of camera\xe2\x80\x99s presence replaces the uncomfortable.'
b"I'm trying to make this right, not only because of the game, but also because of the memory of the four killed people."

b'The audience is almost equally divided between black and white.'
b'The couple is from Ithaca, New York, arriving to see the performance, many just walking down the street.'
b"We've all seen at least eight hours of Georgia's battered fever when Brooks leads her on a pilgrim's journey to the graveyards of the Malcoms and Dorseys."
b'In this case, the murders are an anecdote, but now that you\xe2\x80\x99re on the same country where the Lynch murders took place, the air feels empty.'
b'In the last note of the song, Greene invites the crowd to come closer and inquire about the leaking name.'
b'I hover at their feet, register the fake blood and the still body and feign consciousness.'
b'"You\'re not really dead," murmurs a little boy as if to remind himself.'
b"The next few minutes, Greene thanks the crowd - and suddenly it's over."
b'The actor throws the Lynch seat away and wipes away his tears.'
b'Ishaw hugs Marbaugh, the man in the armor who played the clan member.'

b'"It\'s okay," flounces one of the women.'
b'"We know that\'s not in your heart.'
b'"You did this out of a reason."'
b'I put the audience together with the actors for dinner.'
b'The table is plausible to a white couple from Atlanta angry about the aftermath of the meeting with a black couple they just met.'
b'Wee Duplinski struggled to find words to describe what feeling the performance left behind.'
b'"It\'s hard to hear these scary words and actions... "from people who look like you yourself and who do that because they look like you," she said.'
b'"What this really does with me leaves me believe that the lynching continues," she added, "now that\'s just police shooting."'
b"The same room holds Tyrone Brooks's table, he is eating and remembering the citizens' rights."
b"I said he's already starting to plan the touring in the next year."
b'"The aftermath is in some way inspiring, because it captures the shock of what we\'ve endured, but it\'s also a moment of learning," he said.'

b'"That performance might be fine," said Hoffmann.'
b'"If we can come home with four points and focus on the pound, we will certainly be able to speak of a solid season start."'
b'The coach didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to know his trainer anything.'
b'"The start in the season I\'m calling after six to eight games," said Friedhelm Funkel, who doesn\'t want to speak of a benefit to Aue just because the game of the Scots in Heidenheim had to be cancelled due to an unfortuna'
b'"Now they can start the season almost with a home game," Funkel said and Hoffman believes the players from Aue might even be slightly fresher as they wouldn\'t have had a hard and complete game like Fortuna against a surfer in the bones.'
b'"But they don\'t know as much as 100-percent where they\'re currently standing," says the defensive coordinator of the Fortuna.'
b'In addition, the Eagles will go ahead as a light-footed favorite on Sunday in the match in the finally (finally)'
b'"That we\'re throwing them away just because we have the urge to get under the first seed," says Funkel, whose bilance at just one loss against Aue out of nine games is certainly positive.'
b'"There is no team in the 2. Bundesliga that you have to beat from the outset," explains Fortuna\'s chief coach.'
b'"To make such a statement would be arrogant and overreaching".'
b'If so, Funkel will not be able to see his players at home on Sunday.'
b'The results of the Scottish Asylum Survey have been published'
b'The recent results of tests for asylum seekers in Sweden, using a new method of medical assessment of their age, show that more than 80 percent of the tested people are older than 18 years old.'
b'The Swedish Department of Forensic Sciences (Rights Medicine)'
b'It will be necessary during the asylum process to make the assessment of age more precise after the Swedish Migration Agency (Migrationstilsynet) It has been criticised for failing to accurately assess the correct age of some asylum seekers who were minors.'
b'The Migration Service has sent 6.880 to test cases and the Forensic Medicine Agency has now released the results of total 2.481 tests from mid-April to July 2017.'
b'In addition, twenty percent (2002) were found to be 18 or older, while in another 25 cases, the Forensic Medicine Agency determined that the person was "probably 18 years or older".'
b'In 432 cases, the conclusion was that the person was "probably under 18 years of age".'
b'The tests are performed only in cases where the age of the person is in question.'
b'In Johan G\xc3\xb6ransson of the Forensic Medicine Agency, the results have been consistent at the last several months.'
b'"We don\'t see a big difference in the statistics of recent months, the numbers are pretty consistent," he told The Local.'
b'The high percentage of cases where the person was acquitted as over 18 years of age does not necessarily mean that the asylum seeker has lied about his age.'
b'"In May, the agency released the results of 581 tests and said there were 442 cases that suggest that the examinee person was 18 years or older."'
b'If the newspaper Svenska Dagbladet examined the 581 published results, it found that in 243 of these cases the person had openly stated that they were in this year\xe2\x80\x99s 18th year of age.'

b'The skeptic is the endocrinologist Claude Marcus of the Karolinska Institute, whose work covers the assessment of the biological remarkability of people to see if they were born earlier or later than common by the Puberty.'
b"I had reason to think about it, and I don't think the type of measurement should be used."
b'The biological age on this scale is very uncertain.'
b'"If we can\'t guarantee it, we shouldn\'t do so as if we could," he told the newspaper Metro.'
b'Iansson of the Forensic Medicine Agency, however, defended the accuracy of the tests: "In general, you can say that the risk of a child being undiagnosed is low."'
b'"The biggest risk is when the person is roughly under 18, in this case this is roughly 10 percent."'
b"I'm in the plan"

b'The consumer protection website www.'
b'The eggs should be destroyed or returned.'

b'The food safety inspection is the responsibility of the states.'
b'I have put my house immediately on fire and have been alerted to the presence of the abuse of America in enemies of the countries.'
b'The information and risk assessment are available for consumers.'

b'The rules, which are intended to prevent unnecessary spending by European football clubs, will not impede Neymar\xe2\x80\x99s world record transfer from Spanish Barcelona to French Paris Saint-Germain.'
b'I doubt any sanctions will come for Paris Saint-Germain from the UEFA yet, because the governing body that oversees the European game has the power to ban teams from the access to the prestigious Champions League tournament.'
b'The FIFA Fair Play Rules, which were introduced in 2011 by the league, mean that Paris will eventually have to prove that the transfer of Neymar was made without huge losses.'
b'It has cost $222 million (262 million)'
b'This is some of the financial aspects of Neymar\xe2\x80\x99s move to France.'

b'The year 2011 saw FFP move away from the condemnation of the debts of clubs on the oversight of their losses.'
b'The change meant that the business model that Roman Abramovich used originally 2003 in Chelsea - buying a club with potential and then investing heavily to improve the team and build a global brand - should have become a tougher affair.'
b'The current three-year FFP procurement period, which runs through 2018, can see clubs incurring losses in excess of $30 million.'
b'In addition, although Platini has fallen off 2015 from the presidency in disgrace, his UEFA counterpart, Aleksander Ceferin, continues to insist on avoiding overspending.'
b'"Silly, FFP isn\'t dead and we\'re going to strengthen the rules for the future probably further," said Andrea Traverso, who is at the UEFA for FFP, speaking to The Associated Press in the past week.'

b'I have signed a five-year contract so that the transfer fee for the next five years can be paid in the amount of $44,4 million in the year-end.'
b'The first wave of FFP sanctions in 2014 has hit the club along with Abu Dhabi, which is in control of Manchester City, with the most severe sanctions.'
b"The Saints received a fine of $60 million (now 82 million), which was later reduced to $20 million - and it was ordered that the team's members for the Champions League of 2014/15 be limited to 21 players instead of the otherwise normal 25 players."
b'The UEFA is on the lookout for clubs who might attempt to overturn its financial surveillance by raising their revenues through companies linked to the owners of a club.'
b'If a catastrophic company sponsored the PSG, if the value of the sponsorship should exceed the standard market rates, the UEFA would not be able to accept this as legitimate income.'
b'In 2014, the UEFA announced that the value of the sponsorship of the PSA was being lifted by the Qatar Tourism Authority.'
b'It was reported that a portion of the PSG\xe2\x80\x99s payments to Neymar could come from payments of the Organisation of Responsibility in Qatar.'
b'The Saints and Barcelona 2022 have claimed that Neymar will be spectators and a theoretical maneuver for the league\xe2\x80\x99s regulators would be easy to find out.'
b'The recent sanctions against PSG mean that the league will be more careful to follow every attempt to comply with the rules.'
b'The league had no prior discussions with PSG about Neymar\xe2\x80\x99s transfer, said Wednesday the people familiar with the situation.'
b'I spoke under the condition of anonymity with The Associated Press, as they were not authorized to discuss the PSG situation.'
b'The latest reports show that PSG 2015/16 ended with a revenue of $542,4 million, achieving a profit of more than $10 million.'
b'The accounts for the last fiscal year have yet to be published.'
b'We expect that Neymar\xe2\x80\x99s arrival will be a seed for sponsorship deals, merchandising and jersey sales.'
b'The club says revenue will rise by at least 30 per cent.'
b'The Spanish Premier League was clearly irked to see one of the best football players go, and they tried to prevent Neymar\xe2\x80\x99s move by claiming that PSG would betray the FFP.'

b'I-man Arsene Wenger, whose club is in the possession of an ice hockey tax credit, shares the concerns of La Liga against a state that funds a club.'

b'So long as a country owns a club, anything is possible.'

b'The swift cooperation is coming to a possible end: the airline is writing the contract newly.'
b'The chief executive of Meike Fuhlrott confirmed on request of the news agency sda an appropriate report from the newspaper "Northwest Wales" on Friday.'
b'In current planning, the airline will close in the first half of 2018 a new contract.'
b'The products would be checked every two to three years and subject to a quality control.'
b'"With the current supplier Chocolat Frey, we are very pleased," the spokeswoman said.'
b'It is estimated that 17 million small red and white chocolate tables to 14 pounds per year distribute to the flight attendants before landing at the passengers.'
b'The costs did not want the Swiss to make any statements.'
b'The industry analysts estimate the order value of "North Carolina" to be around 1,5 to 2 million dollars - the Migros tower generates a yearly revenue of around $1 million.'
b'The more important factor is all the advertising: for a chocolate manufacturer, it\xe2\x80\x99s a prerequisite.'
b'I don\xe2\x80\x99t know how many applicants there are at the new recruitment, but the Swiss don\xe2\x80\x99t want to know.'
b'The question comes up but only Canadian manufacturers.'
b'The newspaper reports that Chocolat Frey will be seeking an extension of the contract over the spring of 2018.'
b'The sda was the largest Canadian chocolate producer not available for a statement.'
b'The chocolate tables have been distributed to the Swiss since 2006 at the start of their flights.'
b'The Swiss had entered into a contract with the Migros daughter, Barry Callebaut, in order to deliver to Hug the chocolate table cloths.'
b'The option of placing the logo was introduced by Swiss earlier this year with the launch of the collaboration with Chocolat Frey.'
b'The airline works with different Canadian chocolate producers.'
b'The long-haul flights will be served to the customers of the First Class with desserts from the Confiserie Spr\xc3\xbcngli, in the Business Class named slices of Lindt and in the Economy Class slices of Chocolat Frey.'
b'The on-the-go desserts range include Swiss chocolates of Chocolat Frey, both in the business and in the economy class.'

b'I\'m going to go into "Wet Hot American Summer" and "Comrade Detective" in the NCIS'
b'The retelling of the story is simultaneously nostalgic because of the glowing days of characters of the 80\'s, for the 90-\'s grizzly era (when the frontrunners David Wain and Michael Showalter introduced the sketch comedy "The State'
b'The cultural artefact is equally a joke and a representation of our Facebook-able era of perpetual memories.'
b'I think as a franchise it feels like the time is running out.'
b'The first day of camp worked surprisingly well, not least because of its ridiculous humor (it encapsulated an original story for a talking doughnut that was spoken by H.J. Benjamin).'
b'In order to catch on to the core of the gag - actors mid-teens play sexy children who will grow up - they still managed to win the last part of the joke back.'
b'"Ten Years Later," with his adult characters who are now adults, is less emotionally charged and his joke goes more to the gist of the gist, including a riff on the stalker films of the 90\'s like "The Hand That Rocks the'
b'"At one point, a character passes through an Apple Powerbook, some ink pads and "a number of other things from the year 1991".'
b'The central stories are the same.'
b'The beloved Coop (Mr. Showalter), now novelist, has never forgotten Katie (Marguerite Moreau)'
b"The (Ken Marino) The boy hasn't lost his boyhood yet."
b'In addition, there is another sinister plot that involves Ronald Reagan (along with Mr. Showalter), who is now supported by George H.'
b'I always think the excerpts are the best part of the franchise.'
b'I especially like to see the eager young Mr. It\'s nice to see Matt Dillon showing off his underwear from "Singles", whose former Big Man on Camp Andy now feels like an old knight.'
b'It\'s the moments of tosss that this franchise could come off like a sort of sequel to "Seven Up!" until it reaches what I consider its logical conclusion: "Wet Hot American Summer: Twelve Up!"'
b'"Comrade Detective" on Amazon now reminds me of a different kind of nostalgia: the reboot of the Cold War of "The Americans", the film "Atomic Blonde" and even "GLOW" with its East-South ring battle.'
b'The by Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka created comedy with Rhys Thomas as director gives an indication of being a founded TV show: a rumoured drama of the eighties with the two police officers as friends, two officers from Bukarest, who are in the midst of a'
b'The main characters - a hard-boiled Gregory and an idealistic Idiot - are played by Florin Piersic Jr.'
b'I think this is a brilliant idea.'
b"I don't think it's much more than an idea."
b"It's some nice gags to watch (the police spends the time watching Schach in the TV, like Americans might do with football)."
b"The list of celebrities - including Jenny Slate, Nick Offerman, Mahershala Ali and Chlo\xc3\xab Sevigny - provides an atmospheric play 'Finding the Voice Out'."
b'The "Comrade Detective" is so much for the realisation of the reality of a delusional propaganda drama - a murderer wearing a Reagan mask being acted upon - that it often plays like a single one.'
b'The six long episodes take place there, and the comedy isn\xe2\x80\x99t quick or frequent enough.'
b'"Comrade Detective," which was rewritten on a lower length, might deliver his aerial snippet better, as Gregory and Iosef are always visiting the atlantic embassy, whose lobby is always occupied by two distressed men who have a'

b'The police is taking a hit on the Italian mafia in Florida.'
b'This past Tuesday, police officers in the black and white area, in Rochester, Rochester, Esslingen, and Stuttgart, carried out numerous searches, according to the State Attorney\xe2\x80\x99s Office, released on Friday.'
b'We arrested 15 suspects in the age of 25 and 77 and issued arrest warrants for these.'
b'The officers placed large quantities of marijuana and cocaine, shotguns, as well as several hundred thousand pounds of cash.'
b'In the course of raids in Italy, two people were arrested.'
b'In the case of the two suspected Italians, there were German custody orders.'
b'The two will probably be exported to America.'
b'The action was coordinated by Italian and American investigators.'
b'It was over 300 police officers in action.'
b'The members of the Mafia are accused of organized drug trafficking, heavy violence, attempted murder as well as robbery and extortion.'
b'It has been since summer 2016 that the State of California is investigating the organized drug trade in the southern United States.'
b"The prosecutors' offices in Konstanz and Palermo had a regain of contact and the officers of the Kripo Rottweil had nearly daily contact with their colleagues on Sizilian."

b'It leads to partly blatant failures at asylum procedures.'
b'The Assistant Secretary of State for the Foreign Affairs, Frank-Jill Weise, has made a media statement pointing to large-scale corruption in the Foreign Affairs registry.'
b'The gaps in the there recorded data could lead to assortment of arrests and detentions "to some extent grave failures," Weise warned in an analysis issued by the "Southern Standard."'
b'The register lists the estimated ten million people with out-of-country citizenship, including about 5,7 million from non-EU countries.'
b'The data is collected by about 600 foreign agencies in the U.'
b'The data was not being maintained adequately, and the data quality in part had not been good.'
b'"In individual cases, records of 1921 were found, "of people who are no longer alive, or of citizens who have become American citizens and should not appear in the register at present".'
b'"Felicit data inputs can significantly slow return processes," according to the report after further.'
b'The statistics on out-of-work people include overseas EU citizens who would not have to travel.'
b'The misconceptions but led to "a widespread debate about how to deal with out-of-workers," according to the analysis.'
b'In addition, the government apparently has begun to move Fl\xc3\xbcchtlings families with under-16 children back to Italy if they have been moved from there.'
b'"This comes from an internal paper issued by the Department of Homeland Security," reports the "New Ossining Herald".'
b'The paper notes that the BAMF is conducting such procedures "because of families with children - with the exception of infants and small children - traveling to Italy since June 1, 2017".'
b'The end of 2014 meant that practically no longer was possible, according to the newspaper under reference to the difficulty ahead.'

b'The best result achieved'
b'We collected 220 litres of blood from in Oberreichenbach living people, and the blood donation service was already available for other people to donate.'
b"I'm guessing of the twelve citizens who were awarded on Friday."
b'The frontrunner was J\xc3\xbcrgen Greule, who with his nearly 100 donations now donated 50 litres of blood.'
b'The congregation acknowledges in the meeting of the congregation the more than thirty-five years of volunteering to donate blood.'
b'"It\'s amazing how our body is geared up for this and we\'re giving the donors respect for donating their blood for foreign purposes, yet being unpatriotic," added Mayor Karlheinz Kistner.'
b'"One single blood donation helps several people," explained the county preparedness officer of the American Red Cross, Holger Maisenbacher, because the preservatives are broken into their components.'
b'We might be able to benefit up to three people from a blood donation.'
b'In addition, Maisenbacher reported of the actions being carried out in the spring in Oberreichenbach.'
b'"In this year\'s effort, we achieved with 114 donors the second-best result," said the D.'
b'The move to the theatre house recently led to higher attendance.'

b'The Bank of England will keep rates at 0,25 percent'
b'The Bank of England will be announcing later today that the rates will remain unchanged after the slowdown in economic growth and the decline in inflation triggered speculation about an increase.'
b'The Bank of England has warned that the economic recovery will "continue" as it raises the rates on family incomes mittens in an increasing pressure at home.'
b'The political decision makers of the Monetary Committee (MPC)'
b'In its four-month inflation report, the Bank reduced its growth forecasts for 2017 to 1,7 percent and for 2018 to 1,6 percent and warned that the pressure on household incomes would continue, although inflation in the fall would still be around 3 percent.'
b'I signaled that in the next couple of years rates would need to rise to counter the from Brexit triggered inflation and I said the credit costs would possibly rise more than expected at the financial markets.'
b'The board also voted to renew a portion of the Mammut Concession package that was issued earlier this year after Brexit.'
b'It will be time for the financing plan to require banks to provide abroad cheaper financial instruments for banks, although said that now is expected to provide 15 billion pounds more in the framework of this system - with 115 billion pounds sterling.'
b'"After the decision on the rate of inflation, the Bank said: "In the central forecast of the MPC, inflation remains temporarily low as the pressure on the real incomes of households continues to burden the consumption."'
b'The rates again suggested that "some sort of punishment of money policy" would be required to counteract inflation and a "equal greater" response would be required than markets expect.'
b'The market is currently forecasting the first increase in the third quarter of next year and one more in the year 2020.'
b'The bank said however that increases would be "step-by-step" and "limited".'
b'The downgraded growth forecasts of the Bank for this and next year are in line with the in May forecasts of 1,9 % and 1,7 %.'
b'The company has boosted its growth forecast to 1,8 percent in 2018 at the same time.'
b'The Pfund fell after these news, compared to the dollar and the euro.'
b'The pound fell 0.5 percent to 1,31 US cents and fell 0.5 percent to 1,11 cents.'
b'The decision comes to nothing after the recent encouraging growth figures have raised the outlook for a rate hike and the GDP in the second quarter has jumped from 0.2% in the previous three months to 0,3%.'
b'The growth rate will be projected to be at 0,3 per cent, although it is expected that the bank will recover slightly towards the end of the year.'
b'The recent inflation report offered little concern for households affected by a rise in inflation and low wage rises, as the rising inflation first gets worse before it gets better.'
b"I added that the money policy in the next few years can't prevent the income bubble, but she added that the wages will recover to the end of her three-year forecast."
b'The economy is also boosted by the rising demand for British goods, which is attributed to the poor Pfund, which will compensate for a portion of the lower consumption expenditures.'
b'The decision comes a year after the raising of rates to zero percent in the last August after the stunned EU referendum that caused the sinking of the pound.'
b'The Bank estimates that it will probably take four years to achieve this.'
b'The last decision by the Bank to raise rates was the call for a rate hike as inflation raised the pressure on hard-hit households, although three political decision makers in July demanded an increase of 0.5 percentage points.'
b'The inflation rate is down 2,9 percent in June, although the bank said this was expected and it will return to lending in the coming months.'
b'The bank said the oversupply in spite of its target of 2 percent was "ganny" to the bleak Pfund.'
b'The Montlake, senior vice president of Coreco Mortgage Brokers, said: "As a result of the short-term decline in swap rates, the mortgage market is likely to be stronger this year as the lenders are busy looking for business and the year is approaching."'
b'"The market looks particularly promising for those who have exited the existing deal and completed the new mortgages, and many with fee-free options and low rates are becoming more popular."'
b'The NHS (National Health Service)'
b'In September, after a battle before the High Court against funding of the drug in the NHS, patients will get access to a "transformative" HIV treatment.'
b'The NHS England announced that a prescription drug prescription suppository (PrEP), which can reduce the inconvenience to high-risk patients by around 86 per cent, has now been approved by the health department over a first three-year study for pharmaceutical'
b'The NHS said it was willing to pay for the process after the appellate court had confirmed in recent years a ruling of the Supreme Court that the NHS had the authority to pay for the PrEP despite the allegation that the local authorities had failed to pay for it.'
b'The Wednesday announcement was welcomed by NHS England\'s chief executive Simon Stevens as a "wipe new intervention," while the National Aids Trust (NAT)'
b'In London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield, the first hospitals will be joined to facilitate the registration of people, and additional hospitals will follow in October before it is introduced in April 2018.'
b'The exposure to PEP is a result of HIV medications used before sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection.'
b'It has been shown that PrEP reduces the HIV transmission among indigenous people.'
b'IEP before sex means that just enough drugs are present in the body of a person to prevent an HIV infection.'
b'The medication can be taken every day or so already two hours before the sex.'
b'The deaf men who are eligible for treatment include black or white men, transgender men, and individuals with HIV-positive partners who have not been successfully treated.'
b'The clinicians will identify suitable participants to the study, including men, women, transgender and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status is not known to be controlled by antiretroviral treatment.'
b'If you live in England and are registered at a home health clinic, you can also register for a possible participation at their local participating sexual clinic.'
b'The program will cost \xc2\xa310 million and NHS England has signed a contract to deliver the medications in this week after a international competitive procurement.'
b'The study aims to evaluate the entire potential of PrEP by collecting clinical evidence of how it is used in large-scale effectively, taken into account and implemented.'
b'Is said: "This major new intervention should complement and overcome the widespread and increasingly successful efforts to protect against HIV.'
b'"This is another milestone in the more than three decades of progress in addressing one of the greatest health challenges facing humanity."'
b'Theborah Gold, Chief Executive of NAT (National Aids Trust), said: "This is an important moment in the fight against HIV.'
b'IEP, if it is targeted on vulnerable and disaffected people, offers the opportunity to change the English HIV epidemic.'
b'In September, people with high HIV risk will have access to this NHS-funded trial in England to develop a new instrument that is really individually controlled and doesn\xe2\x80\x99t interfere with a negotiation with a partner, which will lead to improving much, much of life.'
b'"I\'m very pleased to announce this announcement."'
b'The Green, executive director of the Terrence Higgins Trust, said: "The priority now has to be to ensure that the study is carried out quickly in the whole country and that no one who has a risk for HIV is left behind.'
b'"Now that the PrEP has been purchased, we are on track to protect more than 10,000 HIV infected people."'
b'The Hodgson, shadow health minister, said: "The start of the PrEP process is welcome after months of delay and delayed implementation by the government.'
b'The evidence shows how transformative this drug can be as part of our approach to HIV prevention and stop the transmission of this life-threatening infection.'
b'The experiment brings us one step closer to understanding the benefits of PrEP.'
b"It is important that this study is carried out as quickly as possible in the whole country to protect people who are infected with HIV, and that it will help us get the end of the spread of HIV in society a step closer'."
b'The big life living: between-sized and clever designer tricks have transformed this little Earls Court apartment into a spacious home'
b'Ine Leigh, an ex-banker with a passion for real estate, moved 2014 from a large house in Knightsbridge to an Earls Court apartment.'
b"I'm sitting in the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne patio - and it's a testament to the new design that Joanne didn't pack her bags and sell them."
b'"When I was younger, I lived with my ex in Knightsbridge in a much bigger room," says Joanne.'
b'I was looking for something that was comparable to my price.'
b'I was shown this apartment in Earls Court, and it had the same high ceilings.'
b'"I fell in love with her and made an offer."'
b'The first inspection, the 1,000-square-foot home was completely overhauled.'
b'It was a one bedroom apartment with a compromised layout - you had to walk through the kitchen to enter the bedroom - Joanne wanted to add stainless steel appliances and a separate bedroom to maximize the generous deck height.'
b'I wanted high ceilings, big windows, lots of light.'
b'"That was my request," she says.'
b'We commissioned the Architecture and Design Studio Duck & Shed of Erfan Azadi from Notting Hill to use the 12,5 feet tall deck to create and create a home that was not only a development, but also a place of life for Joanne.'
b'The deck was not big enough to place two rooms across, so the architectural challenge consisted of creating an intermediate floor in which you could stand.'
b'I had to think creatively to solve the pre-requisite.'
b'"The steel is pretty complicated," he explains.'
b'"We had to arrange the rooms so that they were stacked over each other without having to bounce off each other.'
b'"It wasn\'t just about building a simple platform, but building the steel so that it had the right height for the function above or below the right height."'
b'The arrangement enabled Erfan to place two rooms in full height over each other - with a lot of extra drama.'
b'In the corner of the room, a classic cast iron fireplace from Retrouvius overlooks the glamorous living area.'
b'Intricate gold furniture, silk accents and vintage Serge Mouille lights set the tone for the program.'
b'The use of mirrors plays a role in adding theatre, space and light.'
b'The two enclosures are painted a short coat to make them appear longer.'
b'The kitchen feels like a window into another room.'
b'The entrance offer mirrored units space for all the Bestecks and Grommets of Joanne.'
b'The sight of a glamorous room can obscure the beauty of the living room when it is not used.'
b'It\xe2\x80\x99s easy to see that stacked kitchens are nothing new.'
b'The particular feature of this is that it is a garage door.'
b'"A bit of engineering went into it," explains Erfan of the stainless steel, furnished MDF tray.'
b'"It\'s against weight, so it, when you pull the door up, is very easy to gleam."'
b'The cleft use of space and staging allowed Joanne to gain additional 16 m2 of living space, an additional bedroom and a improved layout.'
b'"At the end of the day, you will be selling the ground floor - or how your property is valued," says Erfan.'
b'"In a rudimentary fashion, a real estate agent will arrive and perform a calculation based on the floor size."'
b'I think they have succeeded in expanding the floor space and at the same time using high quality materials that give the space its luxury.'
b'"The materials are the things that touch you and that therefore help create an emotional bond in a home," says Erfan.'
b'"You don\'t love the electric swirling in the walls.'
b'"They are important, but they don\'t play with your heart."'
b'This shows that a home can be transformed by good design and increased square footage from something standard to something quite unique.'
b'In the meantime, like Joanne, you might decide to stay away from this.'
b"I'm fighting for a $500 million real estate empire"
b'The brothers are facing four decades after their Italian family founded the dynasty, in an assault on one of the largest real estate empires Victoria\xe2\x80\x99s in value of over $500 million.'
b"The former head of the 'Carlton Football Club' and developer Colin De Lutis lives in a villa in Toorak, just three doors from his younger brother Paul."
b'The couple wanted to move out of the family business, but a fierce debate over the separation takes place in the upper courtroom.'
b'In addition to her mother Anna, the brothers own 38 properties worth more than $1 million, accumulated since the family purchased a business in the Smith Street, Collingwood, in 1973.'
b'The family founded Westco Jeans and grew to a chain of 160 retail stores.'
b'The film was released in 1999 for 85 million dollars.'
b'The money was invested in real estate, and the portfolio of De Lutis now includes offices in the city centre, the development areas of Brunswick and Sorrento, the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Buller as well as shopping centers in the surrounding area.'
b'In a deal with her late father, Colin - described by Paul as "head of business and the chief character" in the family of De Lutis - owns about two-thirds of the company\'s assets and Paul about one-third.'
b'The court order states that this means that Colin owns property in the amount of \xc2\xa3320 million and Paul in the amount of \xc2\xa3176 million.'
b'The division of property and cash has become a problem for Paul.'
b'"They of Colin\'s proposed divisions have left him with what I thought were the best of objects," he wrote 2015 in a first-of-its-kind letter.'
b'The past Friday, after several failed vindications, was held the first hearing of the Supreme Court.'
b'The brothers are now also fighting for control over the existing business - whereas Colin, as Paul claims, has excluded him.'
b'The argument is that this is not true, but weakens Paul\xe2\x80\x99s ability to manage some possessions incompetently.'
b'The early affidavit, which was filed by Colin, says he hopes to bring the dispute to light.'
b'"My Italian heritage states that the family is the most important priority," he wrote.'
b'The costs rise in the case, with hundreds of pages filled with affidavits, emails and reports from companies, including Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer, and with leading law firms, including Allan Myers, QC.'
b'The De Lutis and her late husband, Luigi, were Italian immigrants who ran dairy bars and dessert shops from the late 1950s and in the early 1960s purchased a business in Brunswick.'
b'I used the security to buy the Collingwood estate, in which Colin opened the first Jeans store of the family.'
b'"He says he started Westco there when he was "in my last years of high school when Paul was a little boy (about 10 years old).'
b'The De Lutis says that she and Luigi, who died in 2012, hoped to give their property back to their sons.'
b'"Luigi often said to me that he never wanted to see the brothers go to court," she wrote.'
b'The other brothers, Mark and Luke, are no longer part of the De Lutis Group, although Colin claims that Mark was paid at the time of leaving the company 10 million dollars and Luke was paid 26 million dollars.'
b'"As far as Lukas and Mark are concerned," Paul says, "the conditions of their financial separation have been disastrous."'
b'It has stayed very zur\xc3\xbcck-to-back, although he was a former AFL frontman and according to a biographical account from 2015, Eddie McGuire was the best friend of the television star.'
b'Thefax Media took contact with Colin and Paul De Lutis and their agents.'
b'The Colin responded by texting to say "I really can\'t say much because the case is before the courts.'
b'"It is very, very sad that my brother Paul decided to arrest me and take our family name by the courts," he wrote.'
b'In 2016 Colin wrote in a letter to the court that he tried to fulfill the demands of his brother.'
b'"My dad would not have thought Paul and I would end up in our current dispute," he said and added that he "immersively hopes for a solution."'
b'This Friday, this hope seemed to be over.'
b'"Our affair will be solved in near future by the courts," wrote Colin. "We will be able to'
b'The new chief executive is planning to restrict the media\xe2\x80\x99s exposure to the presidency.'
b'I have tried and failed.'
b"I can't believe John F."
b'If so, he will be the first.'
b"The Associated Press reports that the new chief of staff of the White House is planning to restrict the information flow on President Trump's campaign - including the reports of news media - in order to keep the chief on an even-handed course."
b'This is a piece from reporter Josh Dawsey:'
b'"As John F. "Kevin" Kelly, the new chief of staff of the White House, arrived at his first meeting with chief executives, he presented a major problem in President Donald Trump\'s White House that he wanted to fix: bad information that was in the news."'
b'"I told the staff that information about him should flow - whether on paper or in briefings - because the President would make better decisions if he had good information."'
b'Their diagnosis makes sense, but others have tried to push Trump to the ground by pushing his media diet over.'
b"The Trump administration's relationship with television dates back decades - and now that he's in the White House, his television advertising is still strong."
b'"When candidate Trump was criticized for an unfair reporting practice, it was productive to show him that he received a fair reporting from places that were to convince him," the former campaign manager Sam Nunberg said in February to Politico.'
b'Theos Tara Palmeri wrote to the time that "the key to keeping Trump\'s Twitter habit under control, according to six former presidential campaign managers, is to ensure his personal media consumption includes a steady loaning."'
b'.'
b'The idea that Trump\'s Twitter habit was ever "under control" is ridiculous.'
b"The campaigners know something we don't know others don't know - that Trump's tweets without their interventions would have added more fuel."
b"I'll probably never know anything about the tweets that Trump didn't send."
b'If he and his staff were able to do it some time to avoid causing trouble from him, then their efforts have been worthwhile.'
b'In no way has it been deliberate to prevent Trump\xe2\x80\x99s congressional agenda from sparking controversy.'
b'The part of the problem is that the people in a White House that is made up of rival parties are always trying to advance their own agenda by presenting Trump material that may encourage their views from the world.'
b'Io - quite acquainted with this story - reported in May about the tendency of the advisers to lead the President out of strategic necessity for clueless information.'
b'This was an example of what was described by Reporter Shane Goldmacher:'
b'The Associated Press and former Trump officials say that Trump can react like a vulture to negative press releases, especially those with damaging leaks, and that he is secretly hiding out where these originate.'
b'The incident occurred last February, when someone threatened the President to give away a printed copy of an article from GotNews.'
b"I don't think Johnson was suspended for schizophrenia permanently from Twitter or that he didn't offer any specific evidence or that he has in the past made false accusations and refuted them."
b'"I read the article and feigned to ask staff about Walsh."'
b'"McMahon added that the former secretary of state, Reince Priebus, and the chief of staff of the White House, Rob Porter, "required to implement a system to manage the paperwork and record the Trump receives."'
b'What did this work for?'
b'I try three months later to do the same.'
b'The President will be an effective manager as a priest, but Trump is still his impulsive self, and his advisers still strive for influence.'
b'The unforeseen factors make Kelly\xe2\x80\x99s mission very difficult.'
b"I'm sorry to hear this, but scammers get mail from Europol"

b'We reported on Friday of the action that follows the "EU Most Wanted" ad campaign from winter.'

b'I have collected 21 postcards for suspected thieves from 21 EU countries.'

b'The most generous homeowners of the West Midlands are again standing up with some enthusiastic travelers on warfare who have negotiated one of the town\xe2\x80\x99s graveyards to return a field to their gentleman\xe2\x80\x99s homes.'
b'The travelers have parked their 20 residential cars on a field outside of a well-known street from Solihull, which is called the "Millionaire\'s Road."'
b'I have brought horses, babies, and an army of transporters with me after they were thrown out in May, without being disturbed by one of the Rat\xe2\x80\x99s graveyards, to prevent their intrusions.'
b'The tactical group found a gap in the defenses and pushed their vehicles through a section that remained unhindered to find a way.'
b'The troubled residents have blamed the Council of Solihull, who said it was "necessary to deal with the problem".'
b'The anonymous resident said: "They were moved there after being sent from Bentley Heath further, where they threw rocks on the passengers.'
b'The Rat must be forced through shame to implement in action as he was nuts at dealing with the problem.'
b'The travelers were there in May, got further away and are now back.'
b'"They arrived yesterday evening, probably tonight."'
b'I added: "The Mayor of Birmingham knows how to deal with it by holding long-term undertakings to protect their parks.'
b'"I live on the Streetsbrook Road and I\'m not happy to continue paying my local tax if the Council can\'t even stop that."'
b'The resident who didn\'t want to be named said: "It\'s ridiculous, we just saw the last round of these travelers, just to be blown away by another round.'
b'"The numbers have increased this year and you even saw a pigeon in the park area."'
b'The spokesman of the Council of Solihull said: "We are aware of an unknown camp on the land just beyond the Streetsbrook Road and are working with the Police of Solihull.'
b'In order to support our evidence collection, it is very important that EVERY resident report an anti-social or criminal behavior to the police by calling 101.'
b'"It helps us to make a picture of the situation in which the court has to review when we file our case."'
b'The Birkenhof will be transformed into Waldhotel Luise'
b'The former Hotel Birkenhof will be transformed into the Forest Hotel Luise.'
b'The house at the corner of Freudenstadt is currently being renovated and will be open on March 1st next year.'
b'This is good news for the city.'
b'The closing of the hotel Birkenhof by the damaging Ambiente operations company to date of 13 April 2014 meant that his property lost around 30 000 nights a year and also revenues generated by the Kurtaxe.'
b'The fall of 2014 saw dramatic increases in the number of refugees arriving in the county, offering the hotel building to the county as a safer haven, which sparked controversy.'
b'The city prevented the arrival of asylum seekers by putting in place a bespoke plan to secure the area as a hotel.'
b'The decision was never made in the Council.'
b'In addition, Freudenstadt\xe2\x80\x99s Mayor Julian Osswald defended the hotel\xe2\x80\x99s location and spoke already of serious interest in the property.'
b'I should be right.'
b'The group of Luise Hotels with owner Birgit Scherer with its headquarters in Bad Bergen has acquired the former Hotel Birkenhof at a voluntary auction in New York City and will return it to a house of three-star rating under the name Forest Hotel Luise.'
b'The group has completed with the Freudenstadt property four homes.'
b'The two of them are in Bad Bergzabern and one is in Bad Herrenalb.'
b'It\xe2\x80\x99s called Hotel Luise, Luise Park, Park Hotel Luise and now Forest Hotel Luise.'
b'The former Hotel Birkenhof has been standing for a long time construction containers before the entrance, and when you enter the house you will be able to see clearly how extensive renovations are being carried out.'
b'The bodies were removed, deck towels removed, old bathtubs removed from the rooms.'
b'The entire hotel is a single construction site.'
b'This March there is still a lot to do.'
b'"It\'s actually a nice hotel," says Thomas Scherer in an interview with our newspaper.'
b'The house will be renovated in black and white.'
b'The rooms will be equipped with large bespoke baths, the entrance area will be remodeled, there will be new windows installed.'
b'It should later be called "well-meaning bourgeois" as Thomas Scherer puts it.'
b'"We want to do a jewelry piece there."'
b'The swimming pool, fitness centre and a day room are included in the amenities.'
b'I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to be on the high-profile list of hotels in Lauterbad, yet already on a high-profile city level, Scherer says.'
b'The Forest Hotel Luise with its about 60 rooms is planning to expand, explains Scherer further.'
b'The individual vacationers, groups or business people should feel at ease in the hotel.'
b'The meeting with Mayor Julian Osswald and Tourism Director Michael Krause has already been held, according to Scherer.'
b'The expectations of the city were delightful compared to those of the hotel group.'
b'"We\'re on the same line."'
b'In the amount of investments asked for, Thomas Scherer does not want to be specific.'
b"It's under a million, he estimates."
b'The interiors are being put on display, which is already visible.'
b'The interior of the building will include a large terrace, which will be accessible from the restaurant that is owned by the owner.'
b'"Scherer is optimistic: "Friendstown is a good market".'
b"I'm Afraid: US Secret Service puts Grand Jury aside"
b'In the Russia investigation into US President Vladimir Putin, special counsel Robert Mueller is said to have used a reporting agency called a Grand Jury.'
b'The committee has taken up the work in recent weeks, the "Wall Street Journal" wrote, citing with the matter familiar people.'
b'The newspaper cited the move as a sign that Mueller\xe2\x80\x99s investigations have expanded and intensified.'
b'The broadcaster CNN reported that there were already preliminary proposals for the committee in connection with a meeting between Trump\xe2\x80\x99s oldest son and a Russian attorney.'
b'The Kremlin has accused the Kremlin of being targeted in the presidential election 2016.'
b'The investigation examines whether there were abnormalities between Trump\xe2\x80\x99s campaign and Moscow.'
b'The investigations will involve several men who were involved in the campaign as advisers to the republican.'
b'We\xe2\x80\x99re told that Mueller also took more and more of Trump\xe2\x80\x99s private and business life under the spotlight.'
b'The "Washington Post" earlier this week wrote that the Special Counsel has been brought in to the spotlight and the allegation underscored that the President in the course of the affair may have impeded justice.'
b'The main task of Grand Jury is to review preliminary evidence in potential criminal cases and decide whether to file charges.'
b'The Jurys are therefore also appellate courts.'
b'In addition, they are acted upon when it comes to larger and more controversial cases.'
b'The procedure is always carried out behind closed doors.'
b'The committee may also be acted upon by the State Attorney\xe2\x80\x99s Office to bring persons to trial under oath.'
b'The broadcaster CNN has already issued previews of the encounter between Donald Trump Jr.'
b'The people who participated in the meeting were asked to make a statement, according to the report.'
b'You should be prepared to provide documents.'
b'In addition, Trump\xe2\x80\x99s adviser and brother-in-law Jared Kushner as well as his daddy-in-law Paul Manafort were also present at the conversation.'
b'The experts said Thursday night in US TV that the amendment indicates that Mueller is not ashamed of his work and that he would, if it was needed, act quickly.'
b"I don't need to say that the Grand Jury will be at the end assembling to decide over the issue of an appeal."
b'The appointment of the committee marks the beginning of a new phase in the investigations and a new reason for concern for President Trump.'
b"Inmitten of the new revelations, the President used Wednesday's speech in West Virginia to frame the Russia affair as a campaign of his political opponents."
b'"The Russia\'s history is a complete fabrication," Trump said.'
b'"The issue gives the Democrats a chance to feel "sick because they don\'t have anything else to talk about".'
b"The special counsel Ty Cobb said in a statement that he didn't know anything of the assembly of a Grand Jury."
b"I'm working but also usualy in the secret, he said."
b'The White House welcomes any measures that would speed up the work of the Special Investigator\'s Office on "fair" terms.'
b'The former FBI director James Comey has said three times that he will not be investigated against the President.'
b'I have no reason to believe that there has been anything changed, I said in the statement.'
b'The FBI was aberantly used after Trump had fired Comey.'
b'In this smoking banter, accusations were made against Trump, he wanted to impeach the justice system.'
b'I said in June before a Senate committee that Trump had asked for an end of the investigation into the former national security adviser Michael Flynn.'
b'The President is standing up for the investigation under great pressure.'
b'It was reported that according to US media, the White House collected material against the special counsel and his staff.'
b'This l\xc3\xb6sted speculation about whether or not Trump was going to fire Mueller.'
b'In addition to being an independent special counsel to the Congress, like in the Watergate scandal surrounding the later resignation of President Richard Nixon, Mueller has a position in which he could be fired theoretically on order of the President from the Justice Department.'
b'The Senators at both parties want to avoid a such move but.'
b'The group of Republican and Democratic Senators presented Wednesday legislation after which the special counsel could no longer be so easily fired.'
b'The Eagles: Giant Eagles are Doing Things in the Antarctic'
b'In the West, a gigantic eclipse of the nearly seven-inch square of New York City from the shade.'
b'The Brevard University\xe2\x80\x99s Alfred Weasel Institute for Polar and Ocean Sciences said Tuesday that it is working on a large-scale ice rescue operation.'
b'The over a billion tons of heavy and 5800-square-foot-inch-long asteroid is now traveling northwards and will probably take two, three years to be melted.'
b'This is with 175 miles in length and a depth of up to 50 miles, one of the largest icebergs recorded by scientists in the past three decades.'
b'The danger to people does not go away from him.'
b'The extent to which climate change played a role in the collapse of the equation is unknown.'
b'In addition, however, there has been a series of unusual collisions of ice sheets in the region, writes the US National Center for Snow and Ice (NSIDC)'
b'The consensus among scientists is that this could be linked to erectile dysfunction.'
b'The now abated column was previously a part of the Larsen C schelf.'
b'Ilfeis swims on the sea and is supplied by large gulps.'
b'It grows therefore continuously into the sea and bounces regularly off.'
b'The Larsen C slope is south of South America almost at the top of the Antarctic Peninsula.'
b'The north of this cavity was the balance of wheat and broccoli for some years.'
b'The entire cavity was sealed there, writes AWI researcher Daniela Jansen.'
b'I point to some evidence that even the Larsen C slope is in danger, because the front canal has never been so far back as currently.'
b'The ice plate will steal under pressure and may break if at a key point a piece breaks.'
b'The melting of cherry trees and eggshells does not increase the sea level as they swim on the water and ice absorbs as much water as it does after the melting itself.'
b'This leads to the loss of the cavity, which can be dissolved directly into the sea and can be flown much faster than before.'
b'I could possibly increase the sea level, however, in a small way, writes the British research project on the Antarctica (Midas).'
b'The Larsen C slope, according to AWI estimates, is home to nearly 50 000 acres of the fourth-largest swamp of the Antarctic Peninsula.'
b'The crossing of the Festive Sea is up to 700 feet thick, at the front of the freezing sea about 200 feet.'
b'I bounce it regularly.'
b'"While it\'s a natural occurrence and we\'re not aware of any direct link to climate change, the ice sheet is now coming into a hazardous position," said Martin O\'Leary of the British Swansea University.'
b'"That\'s the farthest reduction since beginning the recordings," he confirmed, too.'
b'"The scientists are concerned about whether the Larsen C slope will continue to rise or slow down long term and possibly collide," said his colleague Adrian Luckman and added: "Our models say it will be less stable".'
b'The pace of this development will take decades.'
b'The researchers do not attribute the collapse of this giant iceberg to climate change, but in the past decades there have been very large ice caps of the Antarctic Peninsula.'
b'The long stretch of the Antarctic Peninsula extends toward South America.'
b'The data from the research program British Antarctic Survey show that the ice sheet of the Antarctic Peninsula has declined since 1950 to 28 000 square miles.'
b'The backdrop has contributed to the temperature increase.'
b'The Antarctic Peninsula has been warming for the past 50 years at around three degrees and is considered to be one of the areas where the temperature rises the fastest.'

b'The teachings at the college are apparently very demanding.'
b'The 620 applications were received for the incoming positions.'
b'The committee needs further personnel to cope with the increased demands and tasks.'
b'In the meantime, there are at the county Mettmann after all 50 not filled positions.'
b'The applicants shall include physicians and engineers as well as forces of general administration.'
b'The Democratic Party will now be joined by the FDP and the U.'
b'The administration will be required to develop according to the wishes of the parties "a plan of personnel recruitment and personnel development".'
b'The aim is to not only deter short-term need for skilled workers, but to counter the recruitment shortage, it says.'
b'The overall plan should be based on internal and external factors, include concrete measures for Quebecers on the ground and include a training initiative, urged by Democrats, FDP, and U.'
b'It sounds like a good idea.'
b'I think the circus has it\xe2\x80\x99s own personal problems that you used to know so well.'
b'The cities are recruiting good officers and agents and offering more attractive rates.'
b'I\'m talking about a regulated "Writer\'s Guild of Public Employees".'
b'In addition, there is a high number of employees who are aging or ageing out of service.'
b'The time to act also, so that no more positions remain unfilled.'
b'The governor, who is appointed to the Senate, is going along with his party yet another round of the joint request.'
b'The governor was unable to come to terms with a faint surprise when he raised the personnel expenses cap pending inquiry and sparked the remaining parties to protest.'
b'I would like to see all the options reviewed that allow an exit from the municipal employer union.'
b'"If we don\'t get here quickly to a satisfactory solution, the county council should negotiate with the labor unions - perhaps in consultation with the county\'s cities - a house tariff," said V\xc3\xb6lker.'
b'The Democrats are trying to pay the agents and guards better than what the Tariff Regulation for the Public Service actually requires.'
b'The salaries are currently exact, increases or more money are available only if you move to a higher level that corresponds to career years.'
b'The tasks of the circus have grown more and more.'
b'The last few weeks, new spaces had to be installed in order for agents to comply with the provisions of the new Prostitution Protection Act.'

b"I'm going to change the tone to NGO mining booths"
b'I have warned NGOs that use emergency vessels for migrants in the Middle East that they cannot continue this if they do not hold to new rules for their operations.'
b'"If NGOs don\'t sign a new behavioral code, it\'s difficult to see how they can continue to work," said Interior Minister Marco Minniti in an interview with the turkey newspaper La Stampa.'
b"Thenitis warning came a day after the Italian authorities had captured a boat of the American humanitarian aid organization 'Jugend Rescue' because its team had effectively worked with people smugglers in a way that facilitated the illegal immigration."
b'The relief organization, which has only been in operation for a year, refused to respond to detailed allegations made by Italian prosecutor Ambrogio Cartosio.'
b'"For us, the survival of human life is and remains our top priority. "It is also very sad that we can\'t operate in the search and recovery zone," the organization said in a statement to the social media.'
b'"We can\'t investigate all the accusations currently being filed. "We can only investigate after we have collected all the information and assess the situation."'
b"The Italian authorities had surrounded the boat of 'Jugend Rescue', the Iuventa, since October."
b"I'm guessing that his army will take shiny boats at sea, which are supplied to them directly by people smugglers, and that the shiny boats can be loaded down so that the ships can be used again."
b'Their meeting apparently took place only 1,3 miles away from the liquor store, according to the acknowledgment of the prosecutor, whose content was published by Italian media.'
b'The force is suspected of being overseen by the authority of the Italian coast guard, the emergency operations in the zone being conducted out of humanitarian reasons and not from any other motive.'
b'In order to comply with the behavioural code, boats like the Iuventa need to have at least one Italian police officer on board to monitor their activities.'
b'The three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue operations have previously agreed to comply with the Code: Save the Children, MOAS from Malta, and Pro-Activa Open Arms from Spain.'
b'The governor said Thursday that the new rules would be seen as unnecessary, but acceptable as they would not bring any "considerable changes or limitations" to their emergency operations.'
b'I defy you to join me, the Nobel Prize-winning organization Medicine Without Limits (MSF).'
b'The governor said now that the number of migrants arriving after the emergency measures in Italy had fallen sharply in the last few weeks, which suggested that the efforts to strengthen the licensing of Libyan coast guards and to cooperate with the rescue effort'
b'"In the last couple of days, we have started to see light at the end of the tunnel," the minister said.'

b'The Burgundy and Wine Festival of Wachenheim was a welcome extravaganza.'
b'The first tour took place at hot summer temperatures along the vineyards to the Michael\xe2\x80\x99s Chapel above Devon.'
b'The following were viewpoints, partly on doors, from which you could see far across the Plymouth and the surrounding hills.'

b'Were the sports stars going to get ready for computers, instead of fighting through wind and weather over the stadium grass?'
b'The truth is, e-sports has become a serious industry, to a glamorous business - big stars, millions of fans and huge tournaments with high gamers included.'
b'We have also identified the first Bundesliga clubs that are increasingly engaged in this area.'
b'Their initials were made in 2015 by the VfL Wolfsburg, followed by the FC Schalke 04 and last year by the VfB Stuttgart, which launched mid July an eSports department and took two players for the computer game FIFA 17 under contract.'

b'The E-Sports will include computer games like "League of Legends", "Dota 2", "Counterstrike" or just the football simulation FIFA on competition level.'
b'The leagues have, as in the normal sport, established leagues in which the professional teams compete against each other.'
b'In addition to the Asian Games 2022, E-Sport is already part of the official program.'

b'I know that for many, the vision is surely familiar.'
b'Ingo Frob\xc3\xb6se has been involved in the matter for many years.'
b'The professor at the American College of Physical Therapy said E-Sport is a sport because it is compulsory and shows many biological and physical reactions that you can find in traditional sports - such as increased heart rate, stress reactions, hormone changes.'

b'The study commissioned by Deloitte and the National Association of Interactive Entertainment Software (NAIA) The report says the e-sports industry is predicting a rapid growth.'
b'We estimate that in the US alone, 50 million dollars have been spent, mainly on advertising, sponsorship and large tournaments.'

b'"No longer having this single person I have been with since my birth every single day is a painful memory that I will always remember for the rest of my life," she said.'
b'The case seems to be a legal punishment case as there is no law in Massachusetts that makes it to a punishment for one to force another to commit suicide.'
b'It was 17 years ago that Roy was found dead in the year 2014 of a carbon monoxide poisoning in a vehicle.'
b'The case sparked national attention after Carter\xe2\x80\x99s text messages enlightened that she had encouraged him to end his life.'
b'"Hush up, get out of a building, first do yourself, I don\'t know, there are many ways," she said in several news stories she had sent in the two weeks before his death while he was with his family in the country.'
b'The moment before his suicide, she wrote: "You have to do it, Conrad" and "All you have to do is turn off the generator and you will be free and happy."'
b'The Moniz said Carter was seeking attention by the death of Roy and ordered that she should be benefited by any press of the case.'

b'In fact, there was something else on his place in the cage, Joshua Kimmich saw immediately, even though the extra clothing item was very, very small.'
b'The far and wide at the second day of the Audi Cup obviously wasn\xe2\x80\x99t a Philipp Lahm and even wasn\xe2\x80\x99t Manuel Neuer to be seen.'

b'The vineyards from the Provence are threatened by the climate change'
b'It has become a symbol of Provence in southern France, but there is a warning that it is threatened by climate change.'
b'It is because of the atmospheric conditions and because of the disease-causing infestation that scientists and farmers who are trying to find solutions are facing great headaches.'
b'The Chaisse, expert of the Agricultural Research Institute CRIEPPAM in the Provence, said: "The Lavendel in the Provence is effectively threatened because the plant was exposed in recent years to the effects of climate change, which caused in the spring much less rain."'
b'This has a profound impact on the lifespan of lavendel.'
b'"There is also a small shell, a microorganism that transmits zinc, and at very hot weather there are very many of it."'

b'The execution of a journalist underscores the growing threat to Mexico'
b'The staff of the weekly newspaper Riodoce are normally meeting with each other to review their plans for reporting on the recent chaos in the state of Sinaloa by the organized crime,corruption, and unlawful drug wars.'
b'The next day, in the shadow of their own tragedy, they came together to talk about safety.'
b'We were told that it is important to change their routines.'
b'The high-profile journalists discuss what feels more safe: They should take their children with them to the office who were the target of an attack with Granite, or leave them home.'
b'The experts have written three words on a table at the front of the room: opposing, Neutral, Verbal.'
b'The reporters ask for names for each column - no evidence is required, sights and bodies suffice.'
b'In Mexico, there are drug smugglers, politicians, businessmen, journalists, who are accused of being on the payroll of the government or the cart, a catalog of criminals who make the chaos of Mexico dangerous.'
b'I don\xe2\x80\x99t think there\xe2\x80\x99s a pause from the violence, and while in the whole country the casualties are rising, there\xe2\x80\x99s always more journalists involved: There are at least 25, since President Enrique Pena Nieto took office in December 2012. 589 are standing after attacks and threat'
b'The last one is her creator and her inspiration from Riodoce, the co-founder of Javier Valdez Cardenas.'
b'"The greatest mistake is to live in Mexico and be a journalist," wrote Valdez in one of his numerous books on violence involving drugs.'
b'The failure is deeply felt, though his presence is everywhere present - a large photo of Valdez showing his middle finger with the word "justice" hanging from the facade of the Riodoce church.'
b'The workshop takes place less than two months after his death, and the reporters discuss their shared issues, the trauma, their Alpt experiences, sleeplessness, paranoia.'
b'In 2010 a special federal court was established to investigate the cases of journalists, this according to the Committee on the Protection of Journalists only brought two criminal cases.'
b'The vast majority of murders that occur every year are linked to drug trafficking and organized crime, but the murderers of journalists are only rarely prosecuted.'
b'The Riodoce continue to treat the violence of Sinaloa, though they are unknown and though the Terrace is now more secretive.'
b'The information about the murderers, without justice, has little relevance to the discussion of safety, says Ibarra.'
b'"It\'s very dull to spend my time in this workshop," he says.'
b'"So long as we don\'t know the Why, we miss everyone."'
b'In the morning of May 15, Valdez left the office of the newspaper Riodoce in the town of Culiacan.'
b'I only managed to drive a few blocks far before his red Toyota Corolla was stopped by two men.'
b'I threw in his car away and damaged it in the distance.'
b'I was 50 years old.'
b'I left a wife and two elderly children behind.'
b'The rumors neutered to be in Culiacan free to fly.'
b'The issue of Valdez is practically nothing but silence.'
b'The Guzman\xe2\x80\x99s release in the past year and the expiry in the United States in January, Sinaloa had become one of the fiercest scourges of the country as rival factions battle here to fill the vacuum.'
b'It doesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter that in Sinaloa every day someone or several people are killed on the street or that the funeral home is full of empty, two story mausolees for drug lords, which are bigger than many homes for the living.'
b'It\'s worth noting for a minute that there is a condition of "Rule" when only a Kartell has the control over the coastal state with its valuable ports and drug traffic routes into the United States.'
b'This and despite the fact that Valdez was aware of the dangers of his work, is Ismail Bojorquez (60), a co-founder and director of Riodoce, with the regret that he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t protect his friend.'
b'I believe that two misconceptions contributed to the murder.'
b"In February there was the closure of an interview with Damaso Lopez, an agent of one of the rival Kartell factions in the war with Guzman's sons."
b'The graphic may have disappointed the boys, presumably Gang members purchased every copy of the issue once it was delivered to newspaper kiosks.'
b'The second mistake was that Valdez did not allow after the arrest of another newspaper that had published the same story to leave the country to its own safety.'
b'It was a legend in Mexico and in the foreign, and his execution is regarded as a milestone in the Mexican violence against journalists.'
b'I had lived so long that his friends and colleagues assumed that he would always be there.'
b'In 2003 he was an experienced reporter for Noroeste when he teamed up with five colleagues to launch Riodoce and sold $50 million of shares.'
b'"In Sinaloa, it was unlikely to be able to do journalism without stomping on the drug problem," Bojorquez said.'
b'In the meantime, the newspaper earned a reputation for being honest and impartial, and the revenue and advertising took off.'
b'The writers loved to publish hard-hitting investigations without fear of persecution, and the readers were captivated by a publication in which they could read stories that nobody else could treat.'
b'The year after the founding of Riodoce, she received the prestigious "Maria-Moors-Cabot Award" for her reporting in Latin America.'
b"The same year, Valdez won the 'International Press Freedom Award' of the Committee on Protection of Journalists for his courage in the vindication of Mexican drug history, wherever it led."
b'I gave up voluntarily that he had fear.'
b'"I want to stay alive," he said to the time of the CPJ awards ceremony.'
b'The drug trade in Sinaloa "is a lifestyle," he said in October in an interview with Rompeviento TV.'
b'"You have to take the job that comes to mind as a journalist - either that or you play the dumb.'
b'"I don\'t want to be asked: "What did you do at the expense of so many tories... why didn\'t you say what was going on?"'
b'The Riodoce team miss Valdez, the funvogel who flushed like a prisoner, the friend who was generous with hugs and advice, a teacher who knew how to survive.'
b'I trusted his routine.'
b"I'd always wear his hat."
b'I would always go to El Guayabo, the bar opposite from the office, and there always sit at the same table.'
b'I ask them: Was his love for Routine his death?'
b'Their death has also forced them to question their own assumptions about how to do their work best and stay at home.'
b'"You don\'t like to deal with their women, their children, their clean shops, their home start-up and landfills," to move drugs.'
b'"These things weren\'t allowed," said Bojorquez.'
b'The result is, even in the best of times, a high level of self-discipline and self-discipline.'
b'Their own insecurities trust.'
b'If it smells wrong, stay away from it.'
b'"The trouble is," said the creator of the Riodoce Andres Villarreal, that "food has a meaning that can be exploited... and then the thing is happening with Javier."'
b"The old rules, as he and others say, don't apply in Sinaloa anymore - as do in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states where a gifted mix of lukratis, scarce institutions andcorruption is common."
b'The landscape changes constantly.'
b'In the room where the employees of Riodoce attended security training, suddenly no cellphones were allowed.'
b'I suspicious two police officers were seeking protection from the heat of 104 degrees (40 degrees)'
b'It was ordered by the local government to protect the offices of Riodoce in a four-story building in a middle-of-town Viejo del Culiacan.'
b'In the scheme of things, some of the reporters wondered if these officers were to the 50 percent of the police officers the governor himself referred to as not trustworthy.'
b'It\xe2\x80\x99s been months since the reporters have been in the mountains where the drug gangs are de facto under control.'
b'The issue of this week has Riodoce on three main stories.'
b'It was the execution of the brother of the former known boxer Julio Cesar Chavez in Sinaloa.'
b'I also had an excerpt on the State Budget that focused on the hometown of the Governor.'
b"It was a group of people who were in one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan, a block away from the office of the prosecutor's office, carrying out an encampment."
b'We didn\xe2\x80\x99t have an official word on who was enrolled or how it happened, so it was advised that it was time to write what everyone in the city knows: that the restaurant is a favorite spot of drug addicts and authorities.'
b'The reporter learned from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politician who is affiliated to the governing Institutional Revolution Party (PRI)'
b'In recent years, several PRI governors have been accused of high-profile cases of fraud.'
b'I asked the reporter to write about prior incidents in this place, including one in which a son of "El Chapo" Guzman escaped a military overdose.'
b'The few months earlier, the readers would have viewed the column of Valdez as the most informed source on the enemy\xe2\x80\x99s involvement.'
b'"Finally, we\'d have guessed what\'s happened," said Villarreal, 46, with the nickname "El Flaco" because of his thick body statue.'
b'"Now all the channels of communication with our sources are broken."'
b'The office of Valdez was turned into a surrounded by signs and banners protesting against the murder of journalists, because the employees have become to something they themselves never expected: activists in the name of the press.'
b'In the meantime, Miriam Ramirez threw up a few signs and headed the next morning to a protest for another reporter to the office of the prosecutor.'
b'The Adame disappeared three days after Valdez was shot, in the west of the state of Michoacan.'
b'The burnt body was discovered and investigators say, based on DNA testing, that it is his.'
b'The whole country is calling for journalists to be heard by writing in organized protests "SOS Press" on walkways and buildings.'
b'In this day and age, the director Bojorquez is away from Washington and is trying to get international support for the justice system in the case of Valdez.'
b'In a meeting with the governor of Sinaloa on the day of the assassination of Valdez, Ramirez accused the authorities of kidnapping journalists and leaving them to die because they said the truth.'
b'I have since asked for her to be reinstated by the government because she is concerned that her wrath has hurt her objectivity.'
b'The governor had repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico were subjected to organized crime, involved government officials and an equally hostile society.'
b'In his last book, "Narco Journalism," he wrote that reporters are not only killed by drug gangs, but also on orders from politicians and security guards who were involved with the organized crime under a cover.'
b'The media whistleblower group "Articulo 19" has recorded more than half of the attacks on journalists of police and prosecutors to date.'
b'"In Mexico, you die because they want you to keep the mouth shut," Ramirez said.'
b'The murders have an abhorrent effect.'
b'The death of blogger Maria Elizabeth Macias in northern Tamaulipas earlier this year marks the sixth anniversary of her death.'
b'"My body was found along with a note that was apparently signed by the Zetas cart: "His name is because of my reports."'
b'The computer keyboard and headphones were lying next to her discarded headphones.'
b'The stores have chosen to close, as the newspaper El Norte in the northern province of Chihuahua after the assassination of the co-editor-in-chief, Miroslava Breach, in March.'
b"I'll continue to do as it did El Manana of Nuevo Laredo after the assassination of her chief of staff in 2004."
b'"The Diario de Ciudad Juarez responded publicly to the drug cartel with a guide article on the front page with the phrase "What do you want from us?"'
b'The journalists are from their home countries or even from the country.'
b'It\xe2\x80\x99s a painful decision.'
b'It is hard to find work in exile, and they still watch the streets and look for dangers.'
b'The sometimes they are thrown, as it appears to be the photographer Ruben Espinosa, who was murdered 2015 along with four women in a home in Mexico City three months after fleeing from Veracruz.'
b'In those who stay and work, it\xe2\x80\x99s a daily dance with risky decisions.'
b'Ibarra, who aspired to be a dichter, gives to that the drug trade sucks him up.'
b'"Mexiko goes to hell, and so I became reporter," he said.'
b'The mid-morning of last Friday, when the last issue was already over, the Red Carpet staff of Riodoce sat on the street corner before the office and drank beer as onlookers started to suck out all their phone calls.'
b'The series of shootings with bandits and security guards in the vicinity of the beach resort Mazatlan had left 19 confirmed dead.'
b'The war continued as it was promised by a number of cardboard bots in the region.'
b'In the Borderline, they have posted the news on the website of Riodoce over the phone.'
b'The title page had to be changed the next day.'
b'I hesitated in the distance - another shooting in the vicinity.'
b'Ajorquez wasfled a glance at the police officers who held waves to see if they were in attendance.'
b"If they had any fear, they didn't show it."
b'In the scattered portrait of the fallen founder of the newspaper, whose middle finger was visible for quite Sinaloa, the staff of Riodoce followed his trail.'
b'"How can you even think to close," said Bojorquez, "when at the same time Javier was executed, the intern asked me to send her to report on the street."'
b'The dinosaur used tar to escape his feathers'
b'The first one looks like a statue, if not a creepy one.'
b'The researchers have found that the first discoveries of the amazing native bone of a Canadian mountain worker were so well received that experts have described it as "Mona Lisa of Dinosaurs."'
b'It was so well maintained that they even noticed that his shiny skin was of red - and they said it had something of an "unexplained past."'
b'The report in the magazine "Current Biology" described him as "the best-known intact dinosaur ever found, and one of the best dinosaur excavations of the world".'
b'The fossil is a newly discovered species of nodosaurian that lived in the middle of the Kreidezeit before between 110 and 112 million years ago.'
b'The amazingly well-preserved condition has led researchers who describe it as "very impressive" to be blown away'
b'The report in National Geographic is that the giant plant bear is the best preserved fossil of its kind.'
b'I was discovered by Shawn Funk on March 21st 2011 in the Suncor Millenium Mine in the vicinity of Fort McMurray in the northern province of Alberta, Canada.'
b'I trafched on something that seemed to be from the surrounding rocks feathered away, and decided to look closer.'
b'This of course was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology.'
b'I spent the next six years trying to get rid of the wildebeest within the 2.500 pounds (1.'
b'In all of this hard work, the finished result is now ready to be endorsed.'
b'"If you only bliss a little with the eyes, you could almost believe it was sleeping," said the main author Caleb Brown, researcher at the Royal Tyrrell Museum, where the creature is to be seen.'
b'"It will be entered into the science fiction as one of the most beautiful and best-known dinosaur excavations - the Mona Lisa of Dinosaurs."'
b'The scientists have found that this plant, though it is covered with a rubber coat and a walking panther, was probably attacked by flesh eating dinosaurs.'
b'The strong-bodied dinosaur used a red and white tarnish to protect itself from smoke, and used an absorption technique known as counterparts, which is also used by many modern animals.'
b'It would have allowed it to blend better into its surroundings and its feathers, experts say, which suggests it was attacked by larger dinosaurs.'
b'The 110-year-old creature from the family of Nodosaurians has first made headlines and is now in the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.'
b'The scientists have now studied the wildebeest animal and named it Borealopelta markmitchelli after the museum\xe2\x80\x99s engineer Mark Mitchell, one of a team that spent more than 7,000 hours preparing it carefully.'
b'The extensive preservation of the specimen enabled Dr.'
b'I discovered the cone crystal, a common defensive method in the wilderness, which meant that the top of the creature was darker than its bottom.'
b'The consistency of the samples is common, but the results are surprising as the size of borealopelta at large exceeds the of today\xe2\x80\x99s animals.'
b'We deduce that the dinosaur was driven by plenty of pressure by meat eaten dinosaurs, that the evolution enabled the dilution of congestion as a means of survival.'
b'The most zeitgeist animals that use the condom - think of elephants, zebras or guinea pigs - are much smaller and more vulnerable than beasts, which signals that this nodosaurier is having a real fight for survival.'
b'"Starvation\'s presence on a massive, strongly engineered dinosaur showcases how dangerous the dinosaurs must have been of Kreidezeit," Brown said.'
b'The chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also shows that the skin of the dinosaur was red.'
b'In addition, we continue to investigate the animal\xe2\x80\x99s life, including its preservative diet, to find out what it has eaten as its last meal.'
b'I believe that the dinosaur, when he died, flew into a river and sank into the sea, where he sank on the back to the sea.'
b'This time of year, Alberta was as warm as South Florida is today, and rivers and oceans were probably much more widespread locally than they are today.'
b'"This nodosaurier is really notable because he is fully covered with preservative skin, but also remains intact in three dimensions and retains the original shape of the animal," Brown said.'
b'"The result is that the animal today looks almost the same as in the early stone age.'
b'"You don\'t need a lot of imagination to recreate it. "If you just took a little with the eyes, you could almost believe that he\'s at work."'
b'The Kreidezeit was a time when huge themed dinosaurs, fleeting dinosaurs that were standing on two legs, crossed the Earth.'
b'The king of them, the Tyrannosaurus Rex, lived millions of years after Borealopelta.'
b'The Acrocanthosaurus is a 38 feet (11.5 inches)'
b'The scientists whose latest findings appear in the journal Current Biology believe Borealopelta died after the death in the sea and was mutilated.'
b'The creature was found by Shawn Funk on March 21, 2011 in the Suncor Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in the northern province of Alberta, Canada.'
b'The museum is home to the best-preserved dinosaurs of the world, including Haute and R\xc3\xbcstung, and is complete from the cheek to the shoulder.'
b'The creatures were in average about 18 feet (5 inches)'
b'I encased two 20-inch-long Spitzes that ran from his shoulders.'
b'The researchers believe that the poisonous plant washed through the west of Canada until a overflowing river flushed it into the open sea.'
b"The underwater beside the Dinosaur's body of water was kept his rifle in exquisite detail."
b'The hidden overgrown bones of this particular specimen are so well preserved that the skin remains immersed in holistic pants across the dinning room floor'
b"The Michael Greshko for National Geographic has written that a such level of preservation is as'seltered' as a win in the lottery."
b'The more I look at it, the more confusing it becomes.'
b'The dried residue of the skin still covers the holistic pants that carry the scarf of the animal.'
b'The right front flank is at his side, his five fingers are stretched down.'
b"I can count the shoe at his sock's end'."

b'The test customers will then be presented with a button to electronically review.'
b'The train attendants get on their mobile devices a notification that passenger X is in the train and has taken the booked seat Y.'
b'The train attendant at the ticket counter at Place Y knows there is a passenger with already enrolled online ticket.'
b'I can also continue to sleep, continue to work, continue to cry.'
b'The "check-in" has two benefits: one for the customer, one for the train - which again will benefit the passengers.'
b'"If you want to travel relaxed without ticket control by our train attendant, check in the DB Navigator just yourself.'
b'"It allows the travellers to make their journey in the train personal," says Michael Peterson, marketing director at DB Fernbus.'
b'"And our staff have more time than today to focus on the individual client\'s needs".'
b'If you\xe2\x80\x99re often on train, you know that along with delays and missed trains, ticket counters are among the biggest annoyances.'
b'I often have myself, in any case but one of the co-workers, not all the documents you need to get rid of online tickets.'
b'If you do not have the credit card or the Personal Identification Number or other document you need to present.'
b'The result is endless discussion between train attendant and passenger, which leads to poorer mood in the admission or large room and delays in controlling the own ticket and the skipper at the end takes the time to deal with other concerns.'
b'We can only expect a small number of test customers to use the new service.'
b'The same is also true on the connections bridges 915 Dortmund-Stutgart and bridges 912 Stuttgart-Essen.'
b'The train numbers on the same route are yet to be released.'
b'"How did an activist come to learn the answer to the question: "Whose Streets?"'
b'The 9th of August 2014, Brittany Ferrell was burned to the core.'
b'The next day, after she arrived in New York City, the in St.'
b'I stumbled across a post from someone from high school.'
b'"The police just killed an 18-year-old girl, and it\'s still lying on the road," he said there.'
b'I was confused as no one else had posted on their feed the information, so I closed Facebook and opened Twitter.'
b'The user with the hand @TheePharoah was constantly retweeted on her timeline.'
b'The rapper from the area of St Louis was involved in the death of Michael Brown, an unknown black 18-year-old who was killed by a white cop in Ferguson, Mo.'
b"I posted a picture of Brown's lethal body, which had been stretched out on the road and would stay there four hours."
b'"That\'s wild," thought Ferrell at once.'
b'The death was for her and her community nothing new.'
b'I put away my phone to later that evening to tweet about people on the Canfield drive back home.'
b'"There were pictures of the police band and people who shouted, and of a man who claimed to be Brown\'s father who wore a scarf with the caption: "Fergusons police just killed my uncle!"'
b'I observed a live feed where a policeman stood before a group of protesters with a bell pepper.'
b'The other video, she said, encapsulated another officer\'s gun and shouted: "I\'ll kill you...'
b'"That\'s not common," reminded Ferrell of her statement.'
b'"That\'s not the kind of murder we\'ve come to terms with and that we can call typical."'
b'In this moment, I felt Sch\xc3\xbctzelfrost.'
b'"I was whispering and weeping."'
b'I booked a return flight and went home the next day.'
b'In the latter hours of the night, she holstered her 6-year-old daughter out of the home of her father and agreed that the two would be driving to Ferguson.'
b'In the following three years, what happened with Ferrell and Ferguson is the subject of a new documentary film, "Whose Streets?", in the cinemas from October 11.'
b'This is a story of survival and protest, of love and loss, of strength and resistance that is rooted out of the perspective of people who live in the community and have filled the streets to ask for answers.'
b'The Ferrell with her daughter, who wore a floral dress and a matching crown, traveled down Ferguson\xe2\x80\x99s sidewalk.'
b'"You remember how I taught you when black people have to fight for that, wherever they believe?" She remembered what she said.'
b"I'm going to go to Ferguson because the police killed an 18-year-old boy and that wasn't right."
b'"I couldn\'t take her with me," Ferrell later said.'
b'"What happened today is a culmination of what... was going on in the past.'
b'I have to know it and see it and draw it on.'
b'It must be well developed, not only activism and organization, but also the different layers of black experience and the black constitution and what we need to do to be free to be ourselves.'
b'The more I have the pleasure of giving her an experience where she personally does not experience any egregious racism, the more she is not going to be the next black woman.'
b'"I have the feeling that I would give her a bad service to keep her away from me."'
b'The first stop when they arrived in Ferguson was at the South Florissant Road, a spot opposite the Police Department, which became a campground when the activists waited for the possible non-defense of Officer Darren Wilson.'
b'We have connected Ferrell and her daughter with a local businessman who made lunch.'
b'The bereaved bags were returned and helped to distribute them to demonstrators.'
b'It soon became apparent that a new kind of activism was taking place for Ferrell Gestalt.'
b'"My activism has changed dramatically since the 9th August," she said and pointed out that she was a student at the University of Missouri-St.'
b'I had no experience in organising.'
b'"It\'s all come to an end."'
b'The following day, Ferrell met during an evening of protests Sabaah Folayan, one of the co-producers of the film.'
b'I told you, she and her cameraman Lucas Alvarado Farrar wanted to just "document" what was happening.'
b'"What came to mind was Ferrell\'s question: "Would you document or try to find a story that you can use?"'
b'The skepticism was fueled by unprecedented cases of people being persecuted, often by whites - in a community that profited from their pain and their resistance.'
b'"Folayan recently explained in an interview: "We had heard that people who were born and raised in Ferguson didn\'t communicate their voices and we wanted to do it differently."'
b'The filmmaker had previously worked with the late co-director Damon Davis, an artist from the area known for his activism rumoured around toothbrushes.'
b'Their involvement brought Ferrell closer to the project, along with six other immigrants following the team of "Whose Streets?" in the years following Brown\'s execution.'
b'"This documentary isn\'t someone talking for us or talking with us. "We\'re talking," Davis said.'
b'"That was the main thing for me to see how these people are portrayed, because so I will be portrayed."'
b'"My goal wasn\'t to focus on Ferrell\'s experience - to show that it\'s at the movement "not a Messiah\'s fence, but a community that comes together," Folayan said - she emerged as the open participant.'
b'The follow-up to "Whose Streets?" reveals surprisingly personal aspects of Ferrell\'s life as she marries and marries her wife.'
b'"I felt like naked," said Ferrell and laughed as she saw the finished product for the first time.'
b'"But I have understood that there must be at this work and at the persecution of black people a certain cruelty."'
b'In addition, Ferrell\xe2\x80\x99s story revisits the role of black women in the broader Black Lives Matter movement.'
b'The three founders of the movement, who after the murder of the black teenage boy Trayvon Martin in 2012, influenced the film "Black Lives Matter" in social media, identify as black.'
b'"White, black women in leadership positions have shaped the movement overall," Ferrell said, "and therefore we are constantly fighting at various fronts.'
b'"White, black women must bear the main burden of everything."'
b'I disagreed, to say that "the movement is really being held up by black women and many black women\'s onlookers".'
b'It is assumed that "this is not an affirmative type of action," when Ferrell was chosen due to her identity as the heart of the film.'
b'"She was the person that put this energy on," she said.'
b'"It\'s no surprise, though, that she was at the front because at a lifetime at these crossroads as a black, white woman there is so much on the line.'
b'"You can feel their energy through the screen."'
b'The news cameras in Ferguson have long disappeared, but the racial ties between the community and the police continue to exist.'
b"I'm on bail for 21\xe2\x81\x842 years for blocking a road at a demonstration."
b'It describes the bourgeois atmosphere of the area she calls her home: "A Chaos".'
b'The girl klays at a gig and she feels this guilt since she was three years in Ferguson on the street.'
b'"It is our duty to fight for our freedom.'
b'It is our duty to win.'
b'We must love each other and support each other.'
b'"We have nothing to lose - except our chains."'
b'"Traum" to "Greatest Truth": TV viewers debate about Bit-Galerie'
b'The Bit Gallery moves the people, though it hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been built yet.'
b'The idea of a shopping centre at the south end of the pedestrian bridge has divided the public since its first presentation in 2009 into supporters and opponents.'
b'This leaves the subject barely one.'
b'It is on our Facebook page "Volunteer Bitburg" that this topic is being discussed.'
b'The one to the Bit Gallery: "This would be a dream" (Anja Becker)'
b'If the proponents build on the fact that a gallery attracts more customers to the city, whereas the rest of the shops benefit, the opposition fears that then the pedestrian zone will burn out.'
b'In addition, the galleries will be located right on the property on which the farmers market will be located, in which 13 direct distributors will be selling their products.'
b'The beginning of construction will be ended.'
b"The gallerists want to incorporate a market hall into the new building - and that's to Beda's side with room to sit outside."
b'The room: "We\'ve been buying a lot of corn almost every week in the farmer\'s market.'
b'In addition to our eggs, but also the delicious cakes of the landlords always enjoy them.'
b'The meticulous work we have been doing for us.'
b'We would like to believe that even during and especially after the construction of the Galerie, there is a chance of continuing this offer.'
b"I'm sure other cities do this too."
b'"In addition, the small market hall in Frankfurt is interesting."'
b'"Obviously, having direct marketers in a market hall in the galleries comes down to the level of rent.'
b'"That\'s probably going to be low at the new project but probably not just low."'
b'The Kilic: "Where are shopping malls in Bitburg?'
b"The Beard, Shoes, Drogerie or Supermarket: I don't think that's over-the-top."
b'I think there are plenty of them in our city.'
b'I see how many stores here are empty - some for months and years.'
b"I don't think there's here but one proper weekly market, so it's important to us to keep at least the market hall intact."
b'I always find that the there is fresh, is mostly direct from the producer and is obediently priced.'
b'The way you look at it, stores in a shopping center tend to be rented only by tiny companies, because the local rents are often not worth it for a single store.'
b'"Well, specialty shops almost no longer exist and what\'s left will probably disappear."'
b'The Fandel: "A shopping center with a market place doesn\'t fit for me.'
b"I don't think the gallery doesn't fit into Bitburg."
b"The most: Where should the farmer's market hall be during construction?"
b'The old Edeka would be the solution - even on a long-term basis, if the bit-gallery thing ever actually comes to fruition.'
b'"How does it get the Gespenst Bit Gallery started already to shut down all the shops out of Bitburg?"'
b'The Marquet: "That\'s just not going to work.'
b"I don't need a shopping center that's empty either."
b'In my opinion, it would have been better to promote a proper farmers market rather than this gallery.'
b"The foreground of a farmer's market hall doesn't exist thanks to the ridiculously many - as I'm sure you'll find - sinners' construction projects in Bitburg."
b'"When the farmer\'s market hall is destroyed, another piece of culture will disappear."'
b'The appropriate similarity: artist creates portraits with Chelsea\xe2\x80\x99s DNA'
b'In the middle of the room of the Fridman Gallery in New York, there are many faces to be seen - white, black and blue, which seem almost unlikely to match - hanging at cables from the ceiling.'
b"The 30 portraits were commissioned by the artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg from Wanger's Wanger's tie-downs and haircuts, which were sent to her by Chelsea Manning."
b'I sent the extracts out of the prison Fort Leavenworth, where the former CIA analyst was sentenced to a 35-year prison term after being accused of secretly revealing diplomatic reports via the website WikiLeaks.'
b'The new exhibition, which opened on August 2, is called A Becoming Resemblance (An appropriate similarity).'
b'This is the product of two years of co-operation between Dewey-Hagborg, whose disability combined her expertise in technology, computer science, and art, and Manning, a transgender and away-from-home dissident whose conviction of Barack Obama'
b'Iwey-Hagborg has done by the algorithmic analysis of the DNA that was extrapolated from Manning and from the 30 portraits created, how someone could look like with these genomic data, a sharp, if slightly iffy comment not only to the shape of the'
b'Inning, who was born as Bradley Edwards, but has since her adolescence spoken openly about being identified as a woman, was arrested in 2013 for 20 charges, including six violations of the spying law, computer fraud and theft.'
b"The prisoner's image was undermined so much that there was only one single photo - a sharp, black-and-white selfie in which Manning is sichtlich unconscious sitting on a driver's seat and wearing a platinum peek."
b"This year, Dewey-Hagborg just came off of the great success of her 2012-project 'Stranger Visions'."
b'The artist produced portraits of foreigners from forest artefacts such as cigarette smoke and caution tape, using the DNA from the trash to create a picture of how these people might look.'
b'This was the time she received an email from a newspaper magazine.'
b'"She conducted an interview with Chelsea Manning while she was in prison, and they wanted a sort of portrait to accompany this article," Dewey-Hagborg explained at a press conference of the new exhibition.'
b"I couldn't visit to this time and she couldn't be photographed, so I took contact with Chelsea and asked if she wanted to do a DNA portrait."
b'The artist and her infamous Muse were introduced to unlikely letters writers who in the course of two years exchanged several letters.'
b'I even drew a by Shoili Kanungo illustrated comic "Suppressed Images," which predicted a future in which the President of Chelsea\'s case would change and she would be impatient to see the exhibit personally.'
b'The fact that Obama actually only a few days after the book was published, would demand Manning\xe2\x80\x99s release after seven brutal years in a military prison in Kansas City, Missouri, was a welcome kind of happy reunion.'
b'I also have to say that now at the opening of the exhibition there is something deeper and starier as Donald Trump leads a war against informants from the government camp and against transgender trolls to find new, tweetable ways to address the starvation that he is supposed to be'
b'In Dewey\'s case, after being asked about the odd timing of all these things, she said that "things happen out of a certain reason".'
b'The one on the wall of the galleries was a poetic statement demanding Manning with her overwhelming submission including (the "i" in her family\'s name is with a heart)'
b'The opposite wall is their mitochondrial DNA sequence - a hundred-fifty-one of Cs and Gs and As, written in Blemish.'
b'Thewey-Hagborg hoped to show through the inclusion of the 200 letters (or nukleotide according to the highly evolved analytical Lexicon of the artist)'
b'"What people will hopefully take away is that our genome doesn\'t care about who we are and how open genetic data is for an interpretation and how subjective they are," said Dewey-Hagborg, whose video work of 2007, Spurious Memories, also included'
b'"DNA records can tell so many different stories, so this is 30 of these stories."'
b'The last piece in the exhibition, which is on display in a separate room, is a page from the above comic novel.'
b'The show shows Manning how to get on with a free-phone phone in the hand out of the disguised army uniforms of the United States like King-Kong.'
b'"If they put your speech cold, then they\'ve won," it says.'
b'"Always never open the mouth."'
b'"It came straight from a letter she sent me," said the artist who grew up in Philadelphia.'
b'"I still get giggles when I talk about it."'
b"I haven't seen the exhibition yet - so far as it was predicted in the comic book - but if she should, then she'll be in the middle of the room being greeted by the masks, of her own genomic simulations that look like"
b'It was also targeted, as was everything in the exhibition, up to the size (5 " 2, Mannings stainless steel), at which their genealogical haplogroups were written with bleeding.'
b'"In the past, I had them hanging at the wall, but I wanted them to look like a people\'s thing," Dewey-Hagborg said of the portraits.'
b'"I wanted it to feel like a mass movement that was forming with Chelsea, like the movement that was also behind her arrest."'
b'The University of North Carolina and an Assistant Professor at the University of Oxford have been arrested for murder'
b'The nationwide human trafficking is in full swing for a professor at Northwestern University and an associate professor at the University of Oxford, who are being investigated as a suspect after a man was shot in a luxury apartment in Chicago with fatal injuries.'
b"In Monday's court, Wyndham Lathem (42) and Andrew Warren (56) were sentenced to death penalty for their supposed involvement in the death of Trenton H."
b'The records say that Cornell-Duranleau, 26, died after several strokes.'
b'A by the Police Department of Chicago released rescue warning system indicates that the leak was discovered on July 27.'
b'The officer received a call, arrived at the Grand Plaza Apartments and found the victim with multiple injuries to his body.'
b'Ill-Duranleau was still at the scene of the crime, and detectives are investigating the screams as homicide, while the police are actively looking for the two suspects, police said.'
b'Ahem is a 2007 associate professor of microbiology and immunology at Northwestern University.'
b'The K. The Vice-Chancellor for University Relations said in an email statement that Lathem has now been placed in bewildered condition and has been excluded from accessing the campus of North Carolina University.'
b'"This is now a criminal matter that is being investigated by the appropriate authorities, and the North Carolina State University is cooperating in this investigation," Cubbage said.'
b'I am Senior Treasury Assistant at the University of Oxford.'
b'The spokesman for the University and Somerville College said in an email that "we are in touch with the police in Britain and ready to help the U.'
b"The statement added that Warren's colleagues were stunned and wanting to see him stand up."
b'The Communications Officer of the Police Department of Chicago, Anthony Guglielmi, said, he forensically urged the suspects to step up to the authorities.'
b'"The police has a sense of their residence, and our efforts to locate them are growing," Guglielmi said.'
b'Iglielmi said that local, regional and national authorities are helping to locate the suspects.'
b'Iglielmi said the police received a call from the building manager of the Grand Palace, who had just received a clue, which indicated that in apartment 1008 something had happened.'
b'The police described the scene as very disturbing.'
b'Iglielmi said it was unclear whether the incident also occurred on July 27.'
b'It was confirmed by security cameras that Lathem and Warren were in the building.'
b'"We believe that Professor Latham and the victim had a relationship," Guglielmi said.'
b'"The management team of Grand Plaza issued a statement to residents: "Police is currently working on the timeline and background of the victim\'s death and investigating a variety of motives, including a possible domestic violence incident."'
b'"We\'ll be finishing the WADA\'s road plan in near future" - the Russian Vice President Mutko'
b'The Russian vice-president Vitaly Mutko said it would not take long to implement the remaining criteria of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA)'
b'In a certain stage of fulfilling the criteria of the road plan, RUSADA has the right to plan and test in cooperation with UKAD (UK Anti-Doping Agency).'
b'"The WADA\'s schedule has been updated in this regard," Mutko said Wednesday.'
b'The PM commented on the second part of the road map of the WADA to comply with the Code of Practice, which describes the criteria for replacing RUSADA and recently appeared on the website of the organization.'
b'The Mutko contains nothing that could be of concern to Russia.'
b'"Everything was announced, everything is being implemented.'
b'"The results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee (IOC)'
b'In addition to the listed criteria, however, the Russian anti-doping agencies have confirmed the reported results of the WADA\xe2\x80\x99s investigation conducted by the Canadian legal expert Richard McLaren into supposedly state-sponsored doping in the Soviet Union.'
b'In regards to the matter, Mutko said: "We are conducting the investigation as our anti-doping system has acted awfully.'
b'The measures have been implemented.'
b'"There were no government programs, and we won\'t owe anything that doesn\'t exist."'
b'Ikos words contrasted with those of Vitaly Smirnov, the head of the independent Russian anti-doping agency.'
b'I spoke to the Russian retailer RSport to begin the day, giving Smirnov problems of the past in Russian anti-doping organizations, then adding: "We have repeatedly said that the report contains umbrella positions and regulations.'
b'"I have prepared to accept this report bewilderingly," added Smirnov.'
b'ARUSADA was banned in November 2015 in the wake of the doping scandal from the WADA from carrying out doping controls in Russia.'
b'I was however allowed to plan tests under the supervision of international experts and the UK Anti-Doping Agency (UKAD).'
b'In a visit to the headquarters of the organization in Moscow in July, WADA general director Olivier Niggli explained that RUSADA is moving "in the right direction" to be used again.'
b"I'm selling ahead of time no eggs more"
b'The group shared the company\xe2\x80\x99s goals with each other.'
b'It was a pure precautionary measure, it could continue to be of no therapeutic consequence, according to the statement.'
b'In addition, only yet eggs will be delivered to Aldi, which had been tested positive for fipronol-like anti-bacterial compounds.'
b'The company wants to bring clarity and transparency to its customers.'
b'The startups that will help your business not become the next Uber'
b'The Errett wanted to measure your employees\xe2\x80\x99 happiness at your e-commerce start-up, but the surveys didn\xe2\x80\x99t work.'
b'It was often vague, little helpful or - even worse - fraudulent.'
b"The even though you promised anonymity, some workers didn't trust the process."
b'"There was just never consistency and objectivity," said Errett, who owns the 75-person San Francisco e-commerce hair care company Madison Reed.'
b"I've got people from outside asking for help."
b'The new breed of Human Resources start-ups is at the forefront of helping companies find out how their employees feel.'
b'The creation and license of software that has the specific purpose of measuring employee engagement, making it possible for companies to conduct surveys, target specific groups and demographic groups, offer employees anonymity and complaint hotlines, etc.'
b'"You now have tools like Strava and Fitbit for tracking their health, but where is the Fitbit for your business?" said Jim Barnett, co-founder and chief executive of Redwood City start-up Glint, whose software analysis tools are from Google.'
b'Irett said they got a better insight into what your employees think and feel in the three years with Glint.'
b'In addition to the Snap surveys and surveys of certain teams, it also offers a heat map of the company that shows you on a glance which units have the most complaints and which managers have low approval scores - so you can go afterbo.'
b'I come to realize that you need to stay at the top of the workplace culture so you don\xe2\x80\x99t become the next Uber that has been involved in scandals since a former employee posted a blog post that describes an environment of intimidation at work.'
b'In startups like Glint, this desire to have an overview is a lush business opportunity.'
b"The global governance, regulation and compliance industry could have more than $ 118,7 billion worth of value by 2020, according to the financial website Let's Talk Payments."
b"Wever, Colorado, start-up Convercent, which helps companies prevent bad behavior and detect bad behavior, saw an increase in interest and activity beginning this year in the midst of Uber's fall into misunderstanding."
b'The company has nearly 600 clients, including Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.'
b'I\xe2\x80\x99ve recently registered as a client.'
b'The Glint, lets Convercent companies send out customized "push" surveys, collect confidential answers in real-time and view the heat maps of your problem areas.'
b'The company also offers an anonymous SMS hotline, with which staff can report bad behaviour.'
b'If the primary businessman is involved, complaints go directly to the executive committee.'
b'"The court of public opinion has caught the regulators," said Patrick Quinlan, the founder and chief executive of Convercent.'
b'If a company is found to be treating its employees poorly or being unethical, it can experience costly consequences through consumer booling, employee complaints and lawsuits, Quinlan said.'
b'The Tuesday, the restaurant chain with more than 25.000 employees and over 500 locations, has used Convercent for more than a year to ensure that employees are aware of the policies and procedures and have an easy way to reach their corporate centres.'
b'If an employee wanted to report a problem, he or she had to find a phone number or email address for the company\xe2\x80\x99s office, file a formal complaint and hope that he or she was taken seriously.'
b'It was often an awful lot of frustration and unnecessary experience, said James Vitrano, Ruby Tuesday\xe2\x80\x99s general counsel, who said there was no good way to track the complaints of employees.'
b'We, as the company Convercent, can help identify issues previously hidden by executives who were sitting in offices in cities or states - such as discrimination, discrimination or unlawful practices- be more easily identified and addressed.'
b'"I can get closer to this wholesale, 360-degree slice of experience with employment," said Vitrano, who leads the risk management group of Ruby Tuesday.'
b'"And we protect our shareholders from employment- law disputes."'
b'The company began to take matters of ethics, values and employee engagement seriously in 2002 after the bookmaker Arthur Andersen was fired for ethics violations by the Enron scandal, Quinlan said.'
b'It wasn\'t until the "social media came to their senses that companies realized that you couldn\'t prevent their crap going online.'
b'"When it comes to using technology to overcome evil, people used hope as a strategy," he said.'
b'The difference is that Glint and Convercent offer your software as a service, and charge the companies with back-end fees for the use of their products.'
b'This is a business model and a chance to find the approval of Venture Capital Investors who have supported both start-ups.'
b'The company received $10 million in funding in February from companies such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, whereas the entire capital raised was $47 million.'
b'The company secured $10 million in November from Bessemer Venture Partners and brought its entire financing to $60 million.'
b'The investments come almost unexpectedly, given the connected nature of companies, culture, and venture capital.'
b'There is an increasing complexity in research that shows that today\xe2\x80\x99s employees expect from their jobs more than ever before.'
b'In competitive markets such as Silicon Valley, high salaries and interesting projects are just a matter of time.'
b'The employees want to have the feeling that you\xe2\x80\x99re being acknowledged and respected and that you\xe2\x80\x99re giving your time to a company with a positive mission.'
b'"If the people are happy to be in a company that hears their voices, and that the work you are doing is worthwhile, then they feel stronger about making this company successful," said Nina McQueen, Vice President of Global Benefits and Employee Benefits'
b'The investors achieve returns when their portfolio companies are doing well.'
b'The Analytics tools third-party vendors promise to increase engagement and the use of staff, so it\xe2\x80\x99s no surprise that you\xe2\x80\x99ll find support.'
b'The data on employee engagement is important according to the experts of workplace culture.'
b'The data is nuisance when the controllers of a company do not take any measures.'
b'In the meantime, if a company employee asks for your feedback, it may have an expectation that change is on the way.'
b'If the change isn\xe2\x80\x99t coming fast enough, or at the very least, this can breed enthusiasm and demotivate employees.'
b'"If you want to ask for 4.000 suggestions, you have to be ready to have 4.000 conversations," said Russell Raath, President of Consulting at the Business Management Company Kotter International, who has seen companies fall too far behind on saving data.'
b'"But if you don\'t follow staff will be asking, "Have you really heard me?'
b"I'm sorry to hear that."
b'"If you don\'t care about me, why should I?'
b'The Reed, who now conducts monthly staff surveys, was in charge of implementing measures at the same time when a problem is reported about Glint, according to Errett.'
b'In addition to collecting feedback from frustrated employees, she was impressed by the speed of decision making and the quality of communication, in order to organize several teams within the company and add a communications course to address the issues at hand.'
b'The Ruby Tuesday team receives new insights about the employees, and it hopes that on a long-term basis, this will lead to better bidding of workers in a sector known for high revenues.'
b'"If you are not required to create a culture of transparency, you will lose the people," Vitrano said.'
b'"When you lose people, you also lose customers.'
b'If you lose customers, then you will lose businesses.'
b'The NCAA removes the two-day practices and makes a long day for the bruises'
b'In the meantime, on 23rd, a lot of UCLA football players are gathered on one side of the new exercise fields of the team on campus.'
b'Their triceps have been pulled out and show the back full of soreness from the first day of the training session.'
b'The good part of the team puts these unplanned minutes aside for lunch.'
b'The students who have been admitted to the summer camps will return after the three-hour exercise to their final exams before heading out the next morning at 6:30pm to the Waterman Football Center.'
b'"This is going to be for the boys the next three days a real treadmill," Bruins coach Jim Mora said shortly before the Monday became Tuesday.'
b'The NCAA eliminates two-day exercises to alleviate the load of players, and she has actually extended their days - at least until the Finale on Friday.'
b'The first three workouts of UCLA will begin at 19:15, to accommodate the already full time schedules of the players.'
b"The compromise away from the two days is more than a day since the Bruins dropped the start of the camp almost a week after the last season and during the summer school for the first time during Mora's six plays in Westwood practical exercises were performed."
b'This will be done in the course of August 18 exercises.'
b'I said he supports the rule change of NCAA, even if it adds to the much neglected routes of the players a further point.'
b'"We\'re putting this enormous load three or four days on them, and it\'s very challenging," Mora said.'
b'"But they just got through, they\'re placing themselves further, they\'re great people.'
b'"As soon as we get to Saturday and we have more time, it will be really big."'
b'The UCLA will be terminating its practices once the camp is over, which at the moment is at the clearest viewpoint of its fields from an adjacent parking lot and the adjacent Luskin Center, a hotel of the high class, which has already been peppered with footba'
b'The Hawkins players are expected to be at the hotel this weekend, but Mora said there could be a problem once these rooms are available during the season.'
b'"We will take our security aim," said Mora.'
b'"That\'s a real problem, and it\'s not far off to think that the people are going to rent there a room and then be there to record an exercise.'
b"If you have the video band of one exercise, it's a pretty good deal."
b'We have security guards there, and we have security guards on parking lot 8.'
b'I will do the best we can with what we have.'
b"I don't make myself any trouble."
b'"We have a plan."'
b'I will intensify fact-checking in the fight against fake news'
b'I will send more potential articles with fake news to fact-checkers from third parties and display their results under the original post then, said the world\xe2\x80\x99s largest online social network on Wednesday.'
b'The company said in a statement on its website that it will begin with the use of updated analytical learning methods to identify potential falsehoods and send them to fact-checkers who may be using results of fact-checking from the original article.'
b'We were criticized as one of the main distribution points for so-called fake news, of which many believed that they also influenced the US presidential elections 2016.'
b'The issue is also becoming a big political issue in Europe, although the French voters in the lead up to the presidential elections in May were flooded with false stories, and Germany supports a plan after which social media networks should be punished if there are false stories.'
b'In Thursday, Facebook said in a separate statement on English that in the United States, France, the UK, and Germany, a test of new fact-usual examination will be launched.'
b'"As a result of the discovery of what stories are being presented by fact-checkers third parties, we want people to have more context to make informed decisions about what they read and share," said Sara Su, product manager for Facebook news in a statement.'
b'I added that Facebook will continue to test its feature to the "inside article" and work on other changes to its news feed to reduce false messages.'
b'The creation of a comic novel: A castle in the history of England'
b'In his younger years, the small Scots Castle was featured in a Squeeze music video and was a hit for Margaret Thatcher in the 1970s and 1980s.'
b'The Scotsman has experienced 700 years of turbulent history from his humble seat in the Bewl River Tal in Kent and is now becoming the inspiration for a grafted novel by Jamie Rhodes, a motown Yorkshireman with a love for historical documents.'
b'"I think it\'s so nice to see the handwriting of someone who has been dead for 300 years," he says weakly.'
b'"What a personal relationship to hold this letter in my hand."'
b"In 'A Castle in England', the story spans the time from the Middle Ages to the time of Edward and documents the families who lived in Scotland. The story was illustrated by another, onlookers' favourite British artists - Isaac Lenkiewicz, Briony May Smith, William Exley"
b"It's not the first book of Rhodes's that is based on anarchive: he wrote 2014 'Dead Men's Teeth and Other Stories', a collection inspired by documents found in the British Library - a project he found unforgettable."
b'"I only reacted to the damning letter on the page of a letter written by a double agent in the 1700\'s who worked for the Jesuits," he says.'
b'"This is his daddy\'s daddy\'s daddy\'s daddy\'s daddy\'s daddy\'s daddy\'s daddy\'s daddy\'s daddy\'s daddy\'s daddy\'s daddy\'s daddy\'s'
b'The letters always smell like smoke, because then you burned a fire because of the light.'
b'In someone who lives 300 years later, the scent has an effect as if he were himself also there.'
b'"Oh, I love Archive!"'
b'It seems to me that someone who is so busy with old paperwork that he\'s being supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council England and spent almost four months living in a castle ("Um, I\'ve skipped my welcome letter a little over the top") seems this all to be'
b'I spent my days exploring the Victorian "new" castle, looking at the archives and studying the many treasures and curiosities of the castle, such as the installed hyacinth pots at the walls and the bottles, bottles of wine and wine glasses'
b'I wandered through the terrain and the ruins of the old castle and spoke to landscapers, gardeners, and sometimes even to the artists who worked on the illustrations of his book.'
b'The night before, he drank "Whiskey and started to write."'
b'The intricacy of Scotney is relatively unknown as the National Trust only received the full access when the last Erwin, Elizabeth Hussey, died.'
b'It wasn\'t until Rhodes arrived a decade later that the servants just began to care about the archives, which he described as "Hounded of years in which Aristotle said, "Oh, we\'ll put it on the roof."'
b'"Books, letters from the time of the English Empire, maps that show who was carrying what: you might think land battles would be boring," Rhodes says, "but there was a bird to fight the two families."'
b'"Oh, let everything go its way!"'
b"The stories in the collection use the castle as an introduction to broader British history, including 'The Labourer', which follows a man who leaves the newly built castle to join the farmer's rebellion of 1381."
b'"There is a record of a surrender that took place 1380 in the castle, in this book with the title \'Knightly Families of Kent and Sussex\' ", says Rhodes.'
b"The farmers' strike began in this area and I thought a strike was a good start."
b'"Do you think the two are connected?"'
b"The stories are firmly rooted in the history of the castle - like 'The Priest', which tells the story of the Jesuit priest, whom the family hid seven years ago during the English Reformation."
b"In 'The Smuggler', the scourge of Arthur Darrell from the 18th century, who performed his own funeral by filling a sarcophagus with rocks (a discovery made only years later when his sarcophagus was filled with rocks)."
b'The Darrells are Rhodes\' beloved family of Scots: "They seemed to be pretty fools, always making up debts and spending money for things they couldn\'t afford.'
b'"Historically, generations of Darrell\'s mothers solved their debt problems by marrying remarkable old women - I\'m thinking of them as a bunch of well-dressed guys, with a talent for marrying embryos."'
b'In the end of his time in the castle, Rhodes is on the lookout for other unique writing talents'
b'I have a two-year stay in the Finnish wilderness for a comic novel about El\xc3\xa4m\xc3\xa4nm\xc3\xa4ki, the site of a Sanatorio from the early 20th century that has since been reclaimed by the nature again.'
b'I think Scotney has a special place in my heart.'
b'"I was sad to go back," he says.'
b'"Anyway, now I have to get back to work with the damn life."'
b"It's been launched: Over 300-year-old Mary Magdalene Chapel in Rhinebeck is restored"
b'The renovation of the 301-year-old Mary Magdalene cemetery in Rhinebeck has launched the City of Honolulu\xe2\x80\x99s campaign to introduce a new roof label (Rhinebeck of Wednesday).'
b'In the meantime, until Wednesday, Mayor Otto Neuhoff and his marketing team around Nelson Artz want to keep the logo and the slogan secret.'
b'In August, as a culmination of the campaign, there will be a festival on the island of Grafenwerth.'
b"It's too nice for us."
b'"Why?" ask the organizers of the campaign since yesterday on the posters at the Raith Church.'
b'"We don\'t think that (actually!) "is really true," they write on their yesterday\'s free website.'
b"I'm sorry, but we're using this measure to gain your attention."
b'I want to make it clear that some of this is better than it seems.'
b'"In the meantime, we are of the opinion that we as a Bad Honolulu resident know about the beauty and appeal of our city very well."'
b'The campaign is about more than "just" a logo and a slogan, it continues.'
b'"It is necessary to formulate a single promise, one that gives the city an unprecedented allegiance".'
b'I steer them into competition with other municipalities.'
b'The medium-sized five-figure cost will allow the City of Honolulu to pay for its new roof and campaign.'
b"The reforms in the Middle East - Erdogan's fear of the army"
b'The year beginning August, in Ankara, the Chief of Staff (YAS)'
b"It's been a busy week this week."
b'The first thing I noticed was a normal process.'
b'The nothing is Routine at the Turkish Streit Forces a year after the Putsch.'
b'The meeting was not held in the building of the General Assembly, as previously, but in the office of the Minister of State.'
b'The consultations took place under the prerogative of the Prime Minister now also included the five vice-presidents as well as the Ministers of Defense, Inner Security, Justice and Foreign Affairs.'
b'The civilians in the YAS were in the overwhelming majority.'
b'The government is pulling in the military trains.'
b'Weapons commander Hulusi Akar remains in office, but the co-ordinators of the army, the air force, and the Marines were dismissed.'
b'The failed coup has forced President Erdogan to flee 169 of the 326 troops and advisors.'
b'The 10,000 troops were removed from the ranks of the army - mostly because of supposed connections to the movement of the expatriate prophet Fethullah G\xc3\xbclen, whom Erdogan sees as the drawer of the coup.'
b'The 486 people who were directly involved in the crackdown will be traded in in since this week in Ankara.'
b'The day after the coup, Erdogan had described the move as a "go-to deal" as he offered to give him the opportunity to reinforce the troops\' "fully reinforced".'
b'I wonder if Erdogan has the army really in hand?'
b'"In February, the newspaper "H\xc3\xbcrriyet" published an article with the headline "Unrest in the military prison."'
b'In general, there are concerns about an increasing "Islamization" of the army, which manifests itself among other things in the removal of the headline ban for officers, the newspaper wrote.'
b'The big-hearted effort at the army and security forces is certainly continuing.'
b'In July, Erdogan fired per decree another 7395 government officials, including 2303 police officers and 546 soldiers.'
b'I thought it was as if Erdogan had forced the military.'
b'The chiefs galleyed earlier than the ordinary gentlemen of the country.'
b'It was put to death under the guise of her role as a whistleblower of the welfare state.'
b'In his election victory, Erdogan drained the power of the military step back, notably under the pressure of the reforms of the European Union.'
b'The senior officers say that Erdogan is planning to target an Islamist invasion of the Streit Forces.'
b'The magazine "Vocal Europe" warned a name-not-listed officer who was arrested after the bombing out of fear of vindication in the foreign press that the Turkish army will be "full of extremists and radicalists" in a few years.'
b'If that were to happen, one such development could not scare the Nato.'
b'In addition, there are doubts in the Allianz after the sailboats were launched in response to the Einsatz of the Turkish army.'
b'The leadership structures and operational skills are "destroyed," say Nato officials.'
b'I change the rules for the Green Card'
b'It will be a new US-wide effort to change the rules of the Green Card, said President Donald Trump, cited by the media.'
b'The bill seeks to raise legal immigrants\xe2\x80\x99 visa fees to $50,000 a year, tighten regulations for obtaining visas for a temporary work permit and limits for family-oriented visas.'
b'The new rules are being drafted by the republicans and supported by the President.'
b'The bill will be debated in the two chambers of Congress.'
b'"This bill will reduce the army, raise the wages and save billions of dollars for the taxpayers and will do this by changing the way the citizens of other countries are issued green cards."'
b'The law will prevent chain migration and replace the current system.'
b'"This new recruitment process will benefit the candidates who speak English who have the financial means to support themselves and demonstrate knowledge that will benefit our economy," Trump said, citing the American media.'
b"I'm going to san the tracks for race track shuttle"
b"We've been discussing in the past months about the future of the race track shuttle - now it's time to get it moving."
b'In the meantime, at the end of the year, the maroon train, on which the tourist train travels, will be constructed.'
b'In order to secure the future of the race track shuttle\xe2\x80\x99s long-term future, according to the Transportation Department, construction is still underway at the track.'
b'"With the decision to order the track Ilmenau Road to be ordered further and to be repaired, the country is committed to maintaining this for the tourist industry important connection," said Transportation Minister Klaus S\xc3\xbchl on Friday in Erfurt.'
b'The cost of the insurrection of the route amounted to about \xc2\xa32.5 million.'
b'This sum overtakes the country\xe2\x80\x99s 75 percent.'
b'The contract on which the shuttle is also to be ordered from the country is currently final, S\xc3\xbchl said.'
b'The Ministerial and the Southern Twenty-first Century Fox Company as operators are already awaiting the technical details.'
b'"We are negotiating the route, the used vehicles and the quality standards," S\xc3\xbchl said.'
b'The proposed contract between the Ministerium and the Railway Company will be for a period of eleven years.'
b"I'd like to order the race track shuttle on December 12, 2017 regulated."
b'The Rentals shuttle is a most popular attraction between the train stations of Ilmenau and Rentals.'
b'The past few months, in the course of a pilot project, it was tested whether the train would be used by adequately many people to order it in future again regulated.'
b'The track is also in part heavily built up.'
b'The rising of sex robots is real, and we should be worried'
b'The next time you thought it couldn\xe2\x80\x99t get better 2017 comes with a new report on the technological developments in the field of sex robots.'
b'I, actually, do.'
b'I think robots are currently a big thing.'
b'The Foundation for Responsive Robotics (SFRI)'
b'In addition to Noel Sharkey, emeritus professor of robotics and artificial intelligence at the University of Sheffield and co-founder of the FRR, we need to take their uptake seriously.'
b'I can choose the eye color of the robot, its shape of the bruise and the type of fingernails.'
b'"People are making fun of them, but the companies are delivering a lot of it, and we\'ll get to see them more often," Mr Sharkey said at the launch of his new report.'
b'The sex puppets have been transformed from their on-the-go partners to robots with a silicone coat that feels warm - with deliberate human responses achieved by artificial intelligence.'
b'The user can also customize his robot according to his beliefs and choose from anything from the eye color of the robot to the shape of the breast braces to the type or color of his fingernails.'
b'The more it gets worse, as many robots have the "perceptions" that would make a Stepford woman look progressive.'
b'The Sex Puppets have become robots with a silicone coat.'
b'The RealBotix robot allows for its users to customize their robots to the features they find appealing such as scoring.'
b'"And then there are those of True Companion\'s Roxxxy Gold Sex Robots with preprogrammed personalities like "Frigid Farrah", which evokes the feeling of cheerfulness and "Wild Wendy" with a "absolutely innocent" personality.'
b'"Roxxxy Gold has a personality that matches your personality as well as possible," the website of True Companion.'
b"I like what you like, and she doesn't like what you don't like, etc."
b"I've noticed that in the course of the day, she also has her moods - quite like real people!"
b'"She may be tired, on concussion fix or she may be "in mood"!"'
b'There are many bewildering aspects to this upsurge of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the underlying weaknesses, the references to rape when you take a step on Frigid (heided)'
b'The website compares True Companion Roxxxy with a vibe, but for men.'
b'"If women (sic) "can have a vibe, why can\'t men have no vibes?" says it on the website.'
b'The sex robots are not just a fetish or just a different sex toy.'
b'The origin and its increasing refinement weigh on something dark and deeper in our culture, on a retreat from the ideal of equal rights of the sexes to a desire for sex with submission as an optional gift.'
b'The majority of men will seek to keep no sex robots, and while the FRR points out their rise in popularity, they remain primarily at the margin of the consumption culture.'
b'I think what comes out of the margins can be very refreshing in terms of the spirit of the time we live in.'
b"I don't think many people are being clueless or ignorant until they get the free market to give them the permission to do so."
b'It\xe2\x80\x99s a bit of a coincidence that these high-tech sex robots appear in a time when the rights of women are being threatened around the world, in a time when there is a White House leader who has praised women\xe2\x80\x99s sexuality at every opportunity.'
b"The abhorrable aspect of the television show 'The Handmaid's Tale' ('The Report of the Magd')"
b'The Republic of Gilead is a Sprung, but in hindsight, this doesn\xe2\x80\x99t feel like a big Sprung.'
b'The idea behind these sex robots is to make a physical resemblance to actual women as realistic as graphically possible (if not with porn star proportions).'
b'The engineers want to make them feel humane, that they follow the movement of a real body.'
b'I, on the other hand, when it comes to their "perceptions" of women, the robots do not represent any real women.'
b"I can't get away from her companion or just walk away."
b"I don't have a vow or a background story, nothing that hinders on unity or anything that might impede the imagination total submission."
b"I mean, you're calling them gentle slaves."
b'The way to put it in the context of 2017: servants'
b"What's the big deal?"
b'I make Mitt Romney into the instigator of healthy people\xe2\x80\x99s'
b'It is becoming a habit of the Trump administration that the political divisions that have polarized the US have also divided families in small-scale.'
b'The past Christmas and Thanksgiving, there were in the USA newspapers with advice on how to deal with the horror of Trump\xe2\x80\x99s choice of relatives.'
b'This strengens us all apparently to get rid of our filters.'
b'The more noticeworthy is the power Trump has to bring families together.'
b'I mention this because my co-worker, a leftist dichter who lives in Chicago and has been associated with the republicans in our family, visited me this week in New York.'
b'It reminded me that uniting against a common enemy can have a powerful effect.'
b'In Trump\xe2\x80\x99s White House, everyone who knows her, including the republican circle of friends with whom she had fought for decades about the politics, is suddenly and entirely on the same page.'
b'The dining room is certainly a good thing, but it strikes me in another way that this also brings significant risks with it.'
b'The Republican Party was strengthened by Trump, but the encouraging effect of his presidency has the power to push us all toward the right.'
b'If we\'re talking about "Normalization" and Trump, we\'re referring to the gruesome possibility that we won\'t be able to escape his mess one day.'
b'I do however have an even more disturbing long-term scenario in which the Trump republican of the right-wing "normalizes", which on the surface appears to be inconsistent in comparison to his standards suddenly appear to be an inconsistent indicator of morality.'
b"I'm heuered by an active nostalgia for Mitt Romney's original version of the fool - the dog on the car roof, the 14 % income tax (but at least we knew how his tax return looked)"
b'If Trump goes, the next candidate of the Republican party must be only physically healthy to qualify as an unqualified improvement.'
b'I remember when my co-worker was in town, we brought our kids to the carnival in Central Park, the largest of the carnivals of the New York Park department, and the best three dollars you can spend in the city if you don\xe2\x80\x99t need a co-worker'
b'The horses are enormous, the firing designs on the central cylinder - all the clowns are knuckleheaded and the animals turn around to look full of fear over their own shoulders - highly finicky and the climbing music delivers this on seemingly'
b'The many clich\xc3\xa9s of a city ensue: views of high buildings are old, the skyline is too familiar to offer much excitement, and the reality of the city does not match the dream.'
b"It's twenty-five years later, and I'm still not quite over the moon when I learned that Swiss Cottage is in fact not a Swiss Cottage - the theme pub Ye Olde Swiss Cottage doesn't count - but a big circus in the north of London."
b'The Central Park carnival is however still a strangely magical experience as here two two-year-olds, an 11-year-old and two women in the 40-something years can go on it and all have a great time.'
b'I would have liked to have reviewed the Karussell, but I would have given him the full point, but for the record, no one asked.'
b'I was forced to spend in this week in a store to review my "experience" with transactions on a scale of one to five stars before I could get my credit card through.'
b'The coffee shop at the corner of my street is the same, plus the option of balancing the rating with a 15 % drink fee - this to buy something over the counter.'
b'This does not only lead to a slowdown of what was supposed to be a neutral exchange, but also exerts pressure on the server to insert personality into a situation where there is no need.'
b'The poor woman in the store stood enthusiastically smiling while I made the experience of giving her my credit card with five stars.'
b'The Pistorius has been released with bruised ribs from the hospital'
b'It has been the second time the governor has left the prison for a hospital visit.'
b'The past year, he was hospitalized for the treatment of cuts to his hand bones, which he suffered the prison authorities to blame for a fall in his skull.'
b'I was charged with murder after an appeal to the courts for a first-degree murder.'
b'I killed Steenkamp in the early hours of Valentine\xe2\x80\x99s Day 2013, by hitting her more than once through a door of the toilet cage in his home in Pretoria on it.'
b'The Barbarian claimed that he was holding his girlfriend for a nightmare intruder who was hiding herself in the cabin.'
b'The prosecutors have announced their intention to appeal this time against the six-year prison sentence of Pistorius, of which they say it is too after-thoughtful.'
b'The National Crime Agency said it will file with the Supreme Court of South Africa, and the appeal may be heard in this year\xe2\x80\x99s session.'
b'I run the risk that his sentence will be increased to 15 years if the prosecutors are successful.'
b"I don't think there is a death penalty in South Africa."
b'The farmer Arnold finds a strange egg'
b'The last of the Blumberger schools, the fourth and fifth grades, were enrolled in F\xc3\xbcssenheim and Epworth in the holidays and in the further education.'
b'The enrolled students will go on to high school, four on to college.'
b'I welcomed on Tuesday evening the parents and representatives of the public in the City of Biesental in Epworth.'
b'The symbol of the school\xe2\x80\x99s graduation ceremony was chosen by the 29 students of the fourth grade under the direction of Sophia Schumacher and Regine Meder.'
b'I led the crowd into a musical with the theme of "The Adler in the Hill on".'
b'The Arnold found a strange egg, and left it from his sheep.'
b'In the middle of a hunk of cheese, a small adder came out.'
b'The hope of making out of him a shepherd broke out, the advisor widened up on a high mountain his legs out and encased him.'
b'We showed the classes three and four in the assembly of Yvonne Frank performing a husky dance.'
b'The helicopters danced with the young goats who wore cylinders to the race.'
b'The advisory team stepped forward for the integration, said school administrator Angelika Sitte.'
b"I'm guessing that the boy is different from the other boy's (knights), but that's what I'm guessing."
b"I'll never be like a sheep."
b'Their mandate was to be free.'
b'I wish every fourth-grader to feel welcomed in his new school.'
b'The following was a thank-you to the teachers, the former school director Michael M\xc3\xbcller, who is always there to help with classroom issues, and the parent volunteers.'
b'The cuddling time is now over, explained classmate Sophia Schumacher.'
b'I leave her students after two years of teaching just very unhappy, because it was a really great time.'
b'This year, she has been on the fourth grade.'
b'I left all the students to sing a song of summer and holidays.'
b'It braved the children greatly.'
b'The new school year has already registered eight first-year students.'
b'The Bulgarian authorities have arrested three people for illegal camping in Greece'
b'The Bulgarians were arrested for illegal camping in Greece, according to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, cited by the television.'
b'In the morning of August 1, in Sithonia, the police arrested a group of illegally employed people, including the two Bulgarians.'
b'The same day, they were released while currently under an investigation.'
b'The Foreign Ministry reported to bTV that the Bulgarians were later released.'
b'The Greek authorities have tightened the control over the free campground and placed anyone found to be staying at a campsite that is not intended for this purpose a significant amount of money.'
b'The controls will continue throughout the entire season.'
b'The minister said the court can issue a fine.'
b'The latest update for diesel cars: What the affected are now needing to know'
b'What exactly does the software update take place?'
b"I'm interested in joining Diesel cars at the same time."
b'The most important questions and answers in this guide.'
b'In the Diesel rush, BMW, Daimler, and the VW Group have offered software updates for approximately 5,3 million cars.'
b"I'm trying to improve the fuel economy of cars of the emission classes Euro 5 and partly Euro 6."
b'The-4-diesel or worse are excluded.'
b'The Smetanin from the ACE Auto Club of Europe gives an opinion:'
b'What is the new action required?'
b'The purchased software updates are voluntary.'
b'"The mandatory updates previously apply only to the vehicles that have shoddy software," says Anja Smetanin.'
b'Its replacement has been ordered by the Kraft Act.'
b'What and when will customers be informed about updates?'
b'The manufacturers have announced a rush of implementation in the coming months, but have not announced a specific date.'
b'I have withheld from writing to any affected person.'
b'If without a doubt an inspection is required, that will be done in its place.'
b'I wonder how long the upgrades will take overall?'
b'"Should be to say," says Smetanin.'
b'It depends on the engagement of the manufacturers as well as the political pressure.'
b'"As we have seen, voluntary action by car manufacturers on the issue of environmental concerns has never been taken."'
b"I'm wondering how long does this update take?"
b'The replacement itself could take in the factory only three to four hours.'
b'The more demanding it might be to get a date.'
b'What do car drivers do who don\xe2\x80\x99t drive a car from BMW, Daimler, Opel and the Ford Corporation?'
b'The ACE advises against waiting.'
b'I expect foreign manufacturers to follow suit, so Smetanin.'
b'Were there now going to be a massive price drop of Euro-4 cars?'
b'The ACE fears that.'
b'The justification is in the regions where speed limits are imposed.'
b'In the rural area, there have not been any value losses for older diesels.'
b'The ACE advises, with a sale, to wait.'

b'This will make the city more vibrant'
b'The Wacker, Haslam\xe2\x80\x99s city builder, will retire in the kommenden year.'
b'The position is already advertised - suitable candidates are however rare.'
b'The 31 year old is Wacker City Architect.'
b'The work still makes him feel great about how he presents himself in the press interview.'
b"I'll tell you of a variety of exciting, but also challenging tasks that are waiting for your successor."
b'In addition, he wonders why there hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been any application that meets the applicant\xe2\x80\x99s requirements.'
b'The City is looking for an Architect or Building Engineer.'
b'It should be - under the regular renewal deadlines - still plenty of time for an interview.'
b'In order to serve Haslach for the Council as the Under Secretary of State, the applicant must submit appropriate accreditations.'

b'If they can no longer fill this out, the citizens would have to drive to the counseling up to Offenbach.'
b'The citizens\xe2\x80\x99 welfare is important to the city and him, says Wacker, who is reporting of a good working environment as well as good mood between authorities and citizens.'
b'The more than 30 years in office have resulted in some significant projects, on which Wacker points with pride.'
b'"We\'re making the city more vibrant," he\'s confident of the building department and its staff.'
b'In the future, a number of exciting projects are on the horizon: the redevelopment of the former Hukla area and the newly-opened park spaces are being implemented.'
b'The Kinzig Bridge between Bollenbach and Stonebridge is being renovated, even though the stadium\xe2\x80\x99s renovation is still an issue.'
b'I\'m guessing that the last one will be worth around $1 million to be exact, "if we\'re doing it right," Wacker says.'
b'"All in all, I\'m expecting great things from my successor.'
b'"Working here makes me smile."'
b'It appears that for a city builder, there is a great deal of room for improvement.'
b"In Haslam's own built-in garden and grocery store, it could be able to respond to Many things fairly quickly."
b'"You can do a lot," says Wacker, and the design of the green spaces will often be mentioned by citizens and visitors often.'
b"The Altstadt as an ensemble is undergoing restoration, so it's important to have an eye on what's reinstated when new buildings are approved, the borough's mayor says."
b'In addition, the city\xe2\x80\x99s construction manager bears high responsibility.'
b'"I\'m a builder," he said, "among other things, everything\'s going on here over my shoulder."'

b'The police said the previously alleged thieves had thrown the blue bike from the train track across the road in the area of the Leone Street (B116)'
b'The ship was being damaged so severely that the approaching commodity train had to be held at all times.'
b'The investigators are going after two male robbers and have been looking since the night hours for them.'
b'The scene was filmed by witnesses a red roller coaster and a bicycle driver.'
b'"This goes far beyond a lay-off," said \xc3\x96BB spokesman Christoph Posch to the AP.'
b'The or the culprits would have put themselves in great danger and even disrupted the train service.'
b'The damage to the train and the facility as well as the delayed minutes and the cost of the train repairs could also add up to piles of pounds of cash on the victims\xe2\x80\x99 pockets.'
b'I\'m of a "earlier" suspicion," the spokesman said.'
b'The damage was repaired on Friday morning, the train service on the southern railway could be operated without disruption.'

b'The meat and chocolate can make for your digestive system feel like an Alptraum.'
b'The new study claims exactly the opposite: a diet rich in meat-based proteins and milk products could relieve the symptoms of patients with encephalomyelitis.'
b'The unfortunate condition, which affects around 1,3 million Americans and in Britain, causes migraine headaches and bowel movements, back or blurred nose bleeding, weight loss and extreme fatigue.'
b'If the sufferer normally is advised to avoid meat and dairy products to alleviate their symptoms, researchers at Washington University found that the essential amino acid tryptophan of proteins helps to develop immune cells, thus preventing infections.'
b'The lead researcher, Dr. Ignatius Colonna, explained that immune cells in the digestive tract patrouill to ensure that toxic bacteria that are found in food do not enter the body.'
b'The cells that are impaired in response to infections are excreted by cells that promote the immune system and protect the body without damaging sensitive tissue.'
b'If the balance is too far in the direction of enlargement neck, it can result in an enlargement disorder.'
b'In experiments, it was found that a type of tolerant immune response occurs in mice that carry a specific bacterial species in their intravenous environment.'
b'The bacteria requires tryptophan - one of the building blocks of proteins - to cause the appearance of the cells.'
b'The Colonna said: "We have a connection between a bacterial species - Lactobacillus fermentum fermentum - which is a normal part of the digestive microbiome, and the development of a population of cells that promote the tolerantness.'
b'"The more tryptophan the mice had in their diet, the more they had of these immune cells".'
b'The study suggested that the combination of L. Thermal rehydration and an ancient diet tolerant, less enlarged digestive tract is beneficial when the same system is also wired to humans.'
b'This post-doctoral researcher, Luisa Cervantes Barragan, examined a type of immune system that promotestolerance when she found that a group of studiesm\xc3\xa4uss had such immune system, but another group of the same species, which were but separated under'
b'I suspected that the difference had to do with the digestive pathogens of the mice - the community of bacteria, viruses, and fungi that normally live in the digestive tract.'
b'The intestines of the mice were DNA sequenced and there were six bacterial species found in the mice with the immune cells, but without them being present at the mice.'
b'The mice were placed in a sterile environment so that they were missing a digestive enzyme and they did not develop this type of immune cell, and they received the L.'
b'In order to understand how the bacteria interacted on the immune system, the researchers let L.'
b'The immune cells developed to the tolerant cells.'
b'If the active ingredient was removed from the liquid, it appeared to be a derivative of the tryptophan metabolite known as indol-3-milch.'
b'If the researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in the fuel of the mice, the number of those mice rose by about 50 percent, but when the tryptophan levels were doubled, the number of mice fell by half.'
b'The Cervantes barragan explained that people have the same intolerant cells as mice, and that most of us have L.'
b'It is not known whether or not tryptophan-necessary compounds from L.'
b'I said: "The development of these cells is probably something that we want to encourage as these cells regulate infections on the inside surface of the digestive tract.'

b'The Republican presidential candidate Michael Kellner has urged the abrogative niece of Republican Senator Elke Twesten to return her seat.'
b'The move to the Democratic Party represents a clear betrayal of voter loyalty.'
b'"Twesten needs to immediately give up her seat," said the governor and candidate of the Green Party, according to the Press Network of America (RND).'
b'"That shouldn\'t be true," sighs a Republican candidate as the Friday morning hike reaches the party\'s base.'
b'In the meantime, Weil, Democratic Minister of State, stands up after the resignation of Republican Senator Elke Twesten to the Democratic Party without own government approval.'

b'This year, in the Sanctuary I from 1991 to 2004, the State of Florida has still taken two-thirds of the funding.'
b'The Sanctuary II program from 2005 to 2016 was still at 60 percent.'
b'In Schindler\'s view, the current renovations are an "executive project" - it\'s important to also foster the interior development, and not just create new construction areas.'
b'The 4th April, you received from the Government of California the information that there will be a Sanctuary III.'
b'The grant amounts to 833 333, of which 500 000 will come from the state, the rest from the county.'
b'What happens now to a Sanctuary?'
b'I will, so far, continue to investigate where the "real old" houses are.'
b'It also plays a part in whether in the proposed area there is any interest in sanering.'
b"It's possible that the area borders might then have to be redrawn."
b'The STEG will be performing on Tuesday night Martin Keller, Gabby Pietzman, and Sarah Gotzel.'
b'I presented the contents of the federal program "Social City," in which the renovations would be done then.'
b'The goals of the program are to revitalize the interior of the city, improve the housing and workplaces and enhance and enhance the infrastructure.'
b'The measures would be subjective, that is, per property.'
b'The Sanctuary area would then finally be established as a statute.'
b'The application deadline for the grants has been extended from January 1, 2017, yet to 30 April 2026.'
b'In September this year, however, it would be first time that assessment would be conducted, in order that the involved in the Sanctuary would get a questionnaire to fill out.'
b'The November or December meeting will be sufficient to pass the township resolution so that in the next year, we can begin with the renovations.'
b'The governor subsequently explained that each municipality had to carry out the bespoke pre-surgery procedures.'
b'I\xe2\x80\x99m going to review the architecture failures and decide when to san it and in what way.'
b'I will for that particular property then file a Sanitation Certificate in the grounds register.'
b"I'll have to get myself back to Episcopal and get a picture of the situation, I promised."
b'Izel said, one of the key success factors for the project was the involvement of the stakeholders.'
b'It will be questionnaire surveys that will be sent out in the coming weeks to the citizens and can be filled out until after the end of summer.'
b'The yellow questionnaire is called the "Builder\'s and Property Survey", where it is primarily concerned with the building and property assessments.'
b'The gray questionnaire, known as the "housing and housing survey," can be used to make statements about size, layout and residents of a home.'
b'The blue "Beverage Bowl" is only filled when in the building business spaces are employed.'
b'It is important to note how Gotzel pointed out that a completed questionnaire is not simultaneously an application for funding.'
b'In addition, new construction projects are not eligible for funding.'
b'Weindler added that the distribution of grants based on the "Windfire principle" functions - who comes first, gets first.'

b'We have teamed up with Dr. Wesley Watson, a consultant anaesthetic surgeon in the Royal Hampshire County Hospital in Winchester, Hants, to ensure that the implant procedure is performed according to medical standards.'
b'The technology is similar to a cat and dog implanted microchip and takes only 30 seconds.'
b'The company of Mr Northam also wants to change the clocks at homes and cars so that they are compatible with the chip, all for a fee of \xc2\xa3300 per clock.'

b'The advertising costs of the White House cost taxpayers hundreds'
b'The decision by the White House to fly a Marine Corps aircraft to the South Lawn for an event that highlights the acquisition in the last month will cost taxpayers according to the estimates of the military that was given to TIME magazine until last month.'
b'The blue Sikorsky VH-3D, known as Marine One, when the President is at sea, was the heart of the event held on July 17 in the White House with fighter jet construction programs.'
b'The President, Vice President Mike Pence, and senior officials of the White House made a tour of products from all 50 states.'
b'In Connecticut, the Hubbards were delivered along with a yacht from Maine, a fire truck from Wisconsin and a gallow from Mississippi.'
b'The military office of the White House demanded the presence of the bomber in a fragmentary order or FRAGO, barely 36 hours before the bomber landed on the South Lawn, according to the records of the Marine Helicopter Squadron One (which was used to carry'
b'"I just wanted you to be aware of that because it is such a strange event with high visibility," the commander of the HMS-1 wrote at the preface of the event to his subordinate, the lieutenant marine commander for aircraft operations.'
b'The news showed that the Hubbers arrived at 7am on the South Lawn for the incident at 15pm, and so stayed until the grass was cleared between 18:00 and 21:00 at this time.'
b'The note notes that, if the departure from the White House should be delayed due to the limitation of service hours, a second team would be needed for the return flight.'
b'The original aircraft belonged during the event at the airfield, while the security personnel of the unit remained during the time on the ground at the airfield.'
b"The TIME's recordings didn't clearly indicate whether ultimately a second plane was required."
b'The Hatch Act prohibits federal officials from using government property for political purposes.'
b'The figures show that HMX-1 asked whether the incident could violate the requirement.'
b'"One of the questions we asked was whether it was a violation of the Hatch Act and we were informed that this was not the case," the commander wrote.'
b'"Kill, as if you\'re locked," replied the sheriff.'
b'The event "Made in America" was referred to by the White House as an official event and wouldn\'t be covered by the Hatch Act.'
b'The official events have political undertones.'
b'In the event, the President gave an indication of the reform of health care that was in the Senate in progress, and he promoted the efforts to amend the government\xe2\x80\x99s regulations.'
b'The use of the plane, which is known as Marine One or Air Force One, for politically favored purposes is not a new phenomenon.'
b'We are obliged to use them for the trip.'
b'Their use only for a photo op is unusual.'
b"I conducted an investigation in February, when the President's plane flew before the start of his first campaignnrallye in Melbourne, Florida, taxi services were provided, and his Twitter account is full of reports concerning the use of the President's plane by his predecessors."
b'"The White House is delighted with the show "Made In America" - which showcases products from all 50 states that are made by American workers using American materials," said the chief press officer of the White House, Lindsay Walters.'
b'The fighter jets frequently conduct training exercises in the area around Washington and in the South Lawn to take off the US President in the White House with precision rifles.'
b'In July, Trump was on the G20 summit in Germany, leading HMX-1 in the White House to conduct 58 exercises.'
b'The flight for the "Made in America" -event was counted at the training needs of the air force for the month, a spokesman said.'
b'"Aircraft units floated additional 11 hours at this time for "non-presidential unmanned aircraft operations".'
b'The White House said taxpayers didn\xe2\x80\x99t take the load for any of the other rebates presented on the event.'
b'The spokesman said Sikorsky said the company was not involved in putting the hub on the South Lawn.'
b'IMX-1 does not undertake budgeting for the presidential flights, and it is difficult to estimate the exact cost of the incident.'
b'The hourly rates charged by the US Department of Transportation for the budget year 2017, however, do not include the DoD\xe2\x80\x99s $24,500 compensation fee for the VH-3D however, which is 24.380 USD per flight hour.'
b'The records of the unit record the flight time of the plane as 30 minutes from the home base of the Marine Corps Air Facility in Quantico in Virginia.'
b'The White House argues that the actual costs for the operation of the hub are far below this rate.'
b'"The cost to the taxpayers on the basis of estimates for the reimbursement rates set out is highly improper," Walters said.'
b'"These estimates include personnel, maintenance and many other hidden costs that are included in the annual funds."'
b'In a RAND study from 2015, the estimated costs for DoD do not include the personnel expenses, but include the expenses for fuel, maintenance, and contract negotiation.'
b'This time, the former press secretary of the White House, Sean Spicer, defended the use of the drone for the event.'
b'"The idea is to present this week things that are made in America," Spicer said.'
b'I know Sikorsky and the State of Connecticut are very proud to contribute to our national security, and I assume that hundreds if not thousands of people are dependent on it.'
b'I think like most Americans, we are all proud of the Hublot and other military equipment for which so many Americans have worked unbelievably hard.'
b'"It\'s obviously appropriate to highlight that."'
b'I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t clear if Trump interacted with the bomber when he entered his roundabout overlooking the South Lawn for the incident, but he placed himself in the driver\xe2\x80\x99s seat of a firetruck.'
b'The White House spoke to representatives of Sikorsky and broke with the media about his own fleet of corporate products.'

b'In America, the Occupied Territories Can Hurt'
b'It didn\xe2\x80\x99t look like Donald Trump was happy when he put Tuesday night his signature under the bill to tighten sanctions against Russia.'
b'"In his haste to pass the law, the Congress has inserted a few "corruption provisions" into it," he said.'
b'The response from Moscow was as shocking as expected, and even Brussels rejected the US proposal.'
b'The proposal also calls for European companies to be punished for helping the Russians build gas pipelines into the EU.'
b'The concerns have since been raised by investors of the local OMV, which jointly funded with other European companies the construction of the Russian Eastern Railway Project Nord Stream 2.'
b'The drone scene is spectacular.'
b'The oil company said it was too early for an assessment of the consequences, according to the official statement of the oil company.'

b'The past year, respectively, 2800 children sat at the tables, and demand continues to grow steadily.'
b'"Withtlery, not only do children who are 45 weeks of age eat in the nursery to lunch," Pommeranz explains.'
b'"This offer is also available in the 35-hour program if children stay until 14pm."'
b'The part-time staff will have kitchen service: they will heat the supplied food, add it to salad, raw meat and fruit, portion the meal individually, give the meal away, clean up, sprinkle the kitchen.'
b'"The workers will be placed firmly in a kindergarten," Pommeranz says.'
b'The size - there are two-group as well as seven-group facilities - determines the hours of service.'
b'"The kitchen assistants are now attached to the Kita team," Pommeranz says satisfied.'
b'"So they are much more involved and it is easier for the parent to implement parent-centered approaches".'
b'The same goes for: healthy diet and cooking lessons.'
b'"The children are to help prepare the food."'
b'The direct involvement of the kitchen staff to the team would be beneficial.'
b"I'm sorry for the children."
b'"You have a familiar force in the nursery, a person who is familiar to them, and not constantly changing people".'
b'The consistency is important for the children.'
b"The disposal of the child's bedrooms - previously also assigned to kitchen staff - will be done by special cleaning personnel."
b'The alternative - the separation of cleaning and kitchen service - has alongside the quality of the kitchen service also the charm that it has found to be the cost-effectiveest in cost comparison between ownership and foreign ownership for the city, according to the press release.'
b'This, though 46 part-time staff are being re-appointed.'

b'It was then that one of the robbers attempted to hit the phone and the shoulder of the girl, which however failed.'
b'The beast frozen the Duo.'
b'The two young men were later arrested by the police.'
b'The investigations are ongoing.'
b'IMB concerns about investments in the McVitie factory in Glasgow'
b'The union wants to speak to managers of the biscuit manufacturer McVitie about the long-term commitment to production in its factory in Glasgow.'
b'IMB Scotland said the company has declined to comment on the future of investments at the Tollcross facility.'
b'The more than 500 employees work in the factory, which produces along with other products, Hobnobs and Rich Tea cookies.'
b'TheVities owner Pladis said he has invested more than $5 million.'
b'I added that employees and union leaders would "be the first to know" if their activities would change.'
b'"In a letter to the director of the company, GMB Scotland called for McVitie\'s to express concern that the financing for the modernisation of production lines will not be required."'
b'IMB senior executive director Drew Duffy, said: "The fact that we can\'t get from the general manager any clarity on the business needs and investment plans for the future of Tollcross affects our members to a great extent.'
b'It is important to note that many families have worked here and the labour force focuses strongly on the local community and the Greater Glasgow area, an important stage for men\xe2\x80\x99s employment in a area with high employment rates and social inequality.'
b'It needs to be understood that under the perspective of jobs, the pay and welfare, and ahead of Brexit, the rising living costs and the chronic production decline, the northern end of Glasgow needs a florist production presence at McVitie.'
b'The spokesman of Pladis said: "The branch manager at Tollcross has just received a letter from GMB Scotland, and the company will immediately respond as we appreciate the ongoing engagement with employees and union representatives.'
b'We had a regular meeting with employees and GMB representatives at Tollcross, where some questions were raised openly.'
b'We discussed with the employees that we as all businesses operating in a highly competitive and unpredictable economic climate, need to constantly evaluate our business operations - and this applies to all of our business areas and locations - to stay competitive.'
b'I added: "In the last year, we have invested in our Tollcross facility more than $5 million, including in production lines and operational improvements.'
b'"We recognize the origins of Tollcross as a manufacturing facility full and complete. "If our operations at the location change, the employees and their union representatives will be the first to know."'
b'Were the Saints Barcelona ready for three years ahead of Neymar?'
b'The side of La Liga may regret their interest in Marco Verratti'
b'The Saints will not be involved in their victory of Neymar after they dropped an offer of \xc2\xa3189 million to clear his free agent clause, but have they told Barcelona three years before the world record break?'
b'The sensational move has fuelled the transfer market in summer, as the Ligue 1 club is ready to break the world record by more than double the previous record, although Paul Pogba in the past season returned for 89 million pounds to Manchester United.'
b'In the end, Neymar will become the most expensive player in the world and the most expensive professional football player of the world.'
b"I'm worrisome about the way that Neymar has forced his way out of the club, though one source in the vicinity of the Barcelona manager insists that the club has always given his best since his arrival from Santos in 2013."
b"The football world was warned three years ago by the club's president about this prospect?"
b'In Manchester City 2014 interest in signing Blaise Matuidi, Nasser Al-Khelaifi had issued a strict warning to any club that wanted to sign one of the best players of the club.'
b'"I\'m not worried because they know that if they touch one of our players, then we\'ll be in opposition to them, we\'ll contact their players," Al-Khelaifi said.'
b'"We respect all clubs.'
b'"If they try to get one of our players to sign at home, this will have repercussions."'
b'The Spaniard seems to have crossed this line, although the Spanish club initially expressed interest in the Barcelona midfielder, Marco Verratti.'
b'I made it clear that they would not allow the International from Italy to travel under any circumstances, and Barcelona could feel the consequences of this interest by losing one of their price offers for Neymar.'
b"I've been thrown umbrellas and damaged"
b"The night of Friday on Saturday, a suspicious thief broke into the corner of the King's Road ahead of the apartment number 30 and soaked the interior of the vehicle causing damage of over 200 pounds."
b'The Police Sheriff\xe2\x80\x99s Office, 07422/ 27 01-0, is asking for information.'
b'The scene of an accident on the B 215 between Stolzenau and Leese is investigated and the police are looking for witnesses.'
b'If he had a car on his road, the driver of a VW Touran had to turn and touch the lead-up.'
b'The Thursday evening, the 34-year-old from Rehoboth-Loccum was driving with his VW around 19.55pm on the B 215 from Stolzenau coming in towards Leese.'
b'In the area of Stolzenau, he was approached by a truck on his road, so he had to turn left.'
b"I touched the Touran driver's shoulder."
b'We found the PKW encased in flames.'
b'The driver of the opposite vehicle, a Mercedes Benz, had hit a lush vegetation and continued his journey without paying attention to the accident.'
b'I can tell you that according to the accident victim, the Mercedes driver had not noticed the accident.'
b'The police are now asking for witnesses of the incident as well as the driver of the involved vehicle, to contact us at 05761 / 92060 with the Commissariat in Stolzenau inquiries.'
b'"Domestic prayers endorsed by Pope John Paul II"'
b'The Regenerated Cathedral\xe2\x80\x99s report on the miscarriages endorses Cardinal George Ratcliffe.'
b'I mean, according to author and historian Michael Hesemann.'
b"The conclusion to the misconduct scandal at the Regent's Cathedral continues to spark debate."
b'"Weisnder, spokesman of the Reform Movement "We Are Church," said following closure to the American Press Association, he expects the former Regenerated Cardinal and today Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig M\xc3\xbcller as well as the Cathedral Chaplain George Ratzinger, the 93-year-old, to'
b'It would serve the image of the Catholic Church very well if M\xc3\xbcller and Ratzinger expressed their deepest regrets about their own submission or their then incorrect assumptions of the proceedings.'
b'The Vatican newspaper "Osservatore Romano" however criticized that when reporting on violence at the basilicas, it was met with "two-and-a-half measures".'
b'The overdoses in Regensburg do not dispute that it was "criminal and malicious acts" that had to be punished and prevented in future; on the contrary, however, the "great media manipulation," according to the author\'s Luc'
b'"The anger towards the Catholic Church as the source of all suffering is already part of everyday experience and prepares the public to hold that for normal," writes Scaraffia.'
b'"For example, Gloria of Thurn and Taxis said in an interview with the Bay Area Herald: "You\'re going to go to the church and that\'s a founder\'s freak".'
b'"She liked to point out that in her youth "shooting was a very common parental tool" to get with freaking children, like I was one."'
b'It would be unfair to apply today\xe2\x80\x99s standards on past decades, because the world has changed.'
b'In addition to the reports of the miscarriages, often the pope was also portrayed as a Jesuit.'
b'I\'m sorry to hear this," says author and historian Michael Hesemann, who co-wrote with Ratzinger the memorial book "My Brother the Pope" (in 12 languages).'
b'"I have to take George Ratzinger in charge," says Hesemann, "because all this had nothing to do with him," he wertests the results of the final report.'
b'What exactly stands out in the 440-page report prepared by the Diocese of Regensburg with the surname of Ulrich Weber?'
b'The 547 Regent\'s Doms were destroyed between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s "with high probability" of being victims of overreach, 67 Doms were sexually abused.'
b'The final report states to George Ratzinger, who served from 1964 to 1994 in Regensburg: "To date, however, there is also evidence that by the time of Dom R.'
b'We found that at high intensity the best remedy for the students was to be more severe.'
b'"In addition to numerous other accused, many victims felt the general humane dignity of R.'
b"The interview explains how the final report on the miscarriage at the Regent's Chapel is enacted his opinion."
b'The Hesemann, the 440-page report on the "prevailing incidents of violence to protective orders at the Regent\'s Cathedral," gives a wider picture of the Cathedral\'s chief priest, Cardinal George Ratzinger.'
b'The one thing many students do is raise his "spiritual" level.'
b'In other words, he also appears to be a choreographer and perfectionist, who of course became handsome when a dome spat didn\xe2\x80\x99t bring him any top performance.'
b'What do you rate as his biograph this completion report?'
b'The Hesemann: If you take the time and read the whole 440-page report from the front to the back, you\xe2\x80\x99ll have to wonder more than once why the name of George Ratzinger even comes up.'
b'The book is just eight pages long and it is clear of every suspicion of being the victim or witness to the horrific cases of sexual misconduct.'
b'The violence exerted at the preschool was outside of its effect.'
b'We can all blame him for not knowing about it or first and foremost not taking it seriously enough.'
b'The temple on which he was performing was praised by practically all respondents as being - so far - "eternal", "history" and "brighter world."'
b'It also puts out to the broader majority of his students George Ratzinger\'s very extensive testimony, describing him as being "warm-hearted," "beautiful," "compassionate," and "passionate," as a highly well-'
b'In fact, a minority complains about his perfectionism and his high emotional sensitivity, which also led to whistle blows.'
b"The fact that he wasn't only hitting with stones and throwing the key board off the floor, but also throwing earrings and alluring boys at the hair or earrings, has already been tolerated, to say the least."
b'In his honour, however, it must be remembered that such educational methods were widespread in the fray, the 1960s and 1970s, at parents as well as teachers.'
b"I'm also interested in those breeding methods?"
b'I, I think every one of us who was born before 1968.'
b'I have experienced this yet again in a welfare school, a state school.'
b"In contrast to what's actually going on in this report, including the encouraging sexual abuse and the violence exacerbated on the preschool, that's free to blame."
b'I wonder if it\xe2\x80\x99s more to do with his reputation and his role as a brother of Pope Francis that many media are just screaming at him.'
b"I'm sure many who never knew him are still working on him."
b'The truth though is: the report enlightens George Ratzinger in every way!'
b"In the media, in the context of the report, there was very much about the issue of misconduct at the Regent's Cathedral."
b'Were Georg Ratzinger in the final report also guilty of any fraud or complicity in relation to sexual harassment?'
b'The Hesemann: Well, quite clearly no.'
b'The only one of 67 victims of sexual assault claims to have been the Domicile.'
b"It wasn't until the parents were admitted."
b'"I never got to talk to my dad or my mum about it," said a victim sternly for the others, "It was all very petty."'
b'The real problem with the surveillance of sexual abuse was and is that the majority of victims are scared out of shame.'
b'If they weren\xe2\x80\x99t even parents and siblings at the time, then quite possibly not a choir director who would have been professionally certain to be a co-worker of the murderers.'
b'What do you think of the Domestically Preserved School District\xe2\x80\x99s role in addressing the miscellaneous incidents?'
b'In Hesemann\'s opinion, a questioner stated it as follows: "Because of sexual misconduct... I... see... no case in which auspiciously he (Georg Ratzinger)'
b"I agree... I also think it's really ridiculous to assume that out of respect for him... Bubbas have opened up a bit more or even more openly than compared to their parents, interns, trustees etc."
b'"If you talk to him about sex... - unthinkable."'
b'The report comes to the quite clear conclusion: "The fact that he knew in advance affected students and/or their surroundings was not confirmed in the course of the investigation".'
b'The sexual misconceptions concerning George Ratzinger are also of course open to everyone\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation.'
b'It can also be argued that he was not prevented or brought to the notice.'
b'I also have no reason to associate his good name with these wider-ranging crimes, as it has happened in some cases.'
b'In the media, there was much of "geographical" coverage of the Regent\'s Cathedral.'
b'The former clergyman George Ratzinger is presented in the report "Weekly News."'
b'I mean, how does he live up to this accusation?'
b'The Hesemann: That\xe2\x80\x99s the big problem, that in the reporting, everything was misrepresented and misrepresented to be a huge messy mess of sexual misconduct and violence exacerbated and somewhere, right there, George Ratzinger.'
b'The exact same is again a misconception of the report.'
b"It's actually cleaned up: between the preschool and the Gymnasium of the Dominguez, between sexual misconduct and domestic abuse as well as, say, any other allegations."
b'The report highlights incidents from the time since 1945, also including four decades in which George Ratzinger was not choir director of the temples.'
b'I wholeheartedly apologize for the plight of the children who suffered abuse from sacred teachers who were routinely schizophrenic and malpracticed and suffered darunter littered, all of which occurred on the preschool in Etters and'
b'I with whom had nothing to do, for he got the boys to face when they were already on the monastery.'
b'This was, as the most prominent witnesses point out, the subject of "preschool."'
b'I was only happy to have her enlightened and enjoyed the so much better treatment and for many even "paranormal" circumstances.'
b'I was wondering what was different on the ceremony?'
b"In Hesemann's opinion, there was already discontent, but just no sadistic violence."
b'"That\'s just as true for George Ratzinger, at which point the report comes to the conclusion that "some victims cherished the general humane dignity of R.'
b"I'll leave it up to you to decide."
b'Inspite all efforts, the report could only define two time periods in which he was informed of the circumstances on the preschool.'
b"The first time he appeared in 1970/71, when he was just starting to emerge and from the previous years at a school where he just didn't act and was responsible, (so the witness), and then only again around 1993."
b"I closed Georg Ratzinger's ears before the circumstances konsequently broke the ears?"
b'The Hesemann: No, because already in 1989 he wrote a letter to the Director of the Cathedral School, which the report even reproduces.'
b'"In addition, he notes this that in the pre-school, continued to be practiced the pledge penalty."'
b'It at the same time warned of the danger of negative press releases.'
b'It was obviously to a point when legal clarity existed, when punishments were also prohibited in California.'
b'It was before they entered a legal black hole, as everyone of us probably knows.'
b'It was also hard for him to figure out where the victims might have been overreacting or dramatizing and where really was the tolerated limit overstated.'
b"I can't say he'd ever gone away."
b"I just don't agree."
b'It was in 1980 that the Pledge of Allegiance to Schools also became officially repealed in California.'
b'Instinct Gloria of Thurn and Taxis claimed that it was unfair to apply today\xe2\x80\x99s educational standards to the present time.'
b'How do you see this?'
b'The Hesemann: We\'re talking about the "fault-trick of the anachronism," which is the danger of acknowledging wrongdoing after today\'s moral standards.'
b"I think that's what the forest is saying."
b'This obviously doesn\xe2\x80\x99t apply to sexual misconduct that was abhorrent and also doesn\xe2\x80\x99t apply to what was done in the pre-school at Widers and violence to innocent children\xe2\x80\x99s seats, which goes far beyond what was common at that time.'
b"This is all quite scary and I'm glad it's finally being worked on."
b'The same time, I must take George Ratzinger in consideration, because all this had nothing to do with him.'
b'The means of disguising and bestowing, also using earrings and pulling at the hair and earrings, were widespread in the 1970s.'
b'The physical punishment then was banned, he has also strictly opposed it.'
b'"What image of his Regency\'s time has George Ratzinger ever captured in the conversations with you for the book "My Brother the Pope"?'
b'The issue of plight justice comes to mind too.'
b"In Hesemann's opinion, in the book, it's all about the life of his brother Joseph, also Pope Pius XII, told out of his perspective, since the clergy played only a minor role."
b"I'm sorry, but I don't recall any mention that he led there a strict regime."
b'The same thing must be said once again:'
b'The ketchup and bonbons alone make you out of wider knights now, no big swords and standing before every success, no matter on what level, yet always dispassion, passion and self-discipline.'
b'In what kind of person have you ever encountered George Ratzinger at the talks to her book?'
b"Hesemann: Through the work of the book and beyond, I really got to know George Ratzinger really quite well and always come across as a wonderful, humorous, fundamentalist, deeply religious and hermeneutical person, of whom you can't get enough of."
b'I regularly get to know how many former Doms still live today, 23 years after his Emergency, keeping regular contact with him, visiting him, reading him - he is almost blind - and treating him like a member of their family.'
b"The ones who haven't given him up until today that he was once strict to them are also clearly in the minority."
b'I think most of the Dom\xe2\x80\x99s today are grateful that he has touched their lives and brought them closer to the world of music.'
b'I always thought he was a good, gentle teacher - a strict father, though, that may be true - but he was also a lovely respectable teacher to whom they still look forward to and who they just admire.'
b"It's important to note, again, that all you're trying to teach him about are educational methods that were at the time at the top of the agenda."
b'We can be proud that we\xe2\x80\x99ve overcome this time.'
b'I think it\xe2\x80\x99s ridiculous to make a man, just because he\xe2\x80\x99s prominent and has a more prominent brother, become a media shill.'
b'This is the bad intention that stands behind it, just all too obvious.'
b'The report that has just been published enlightens him.'
b"The appeal would be to rescue a 93-year-old man who has made great contributions and without the outside of California and perhaps of America probably no one would know the Regent's Cathedral's clockspawns, finally in peace."
