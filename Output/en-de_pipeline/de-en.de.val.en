A'Miller did not engage in literary criticism - he made it clear that these people are not welcome in Trump's USA.'
''This conflict because of the importance of a statue is part of a broader political and cultural awakening: It is in fact a conflict about the importance of America.'
A'Lazarus - and her friends who joined daf\xc3\xbcr to place their words after her death at the base - knew very well that they were doing a high-level action fully.'
A'The sculpture should show the connections between franz\xc3\xb6s and fascist republicanism by showing in a compromised classical graphic representation the weakness of the Verk\xc3\xb6rpation of freedom.
A'Lazarus rendered\xc3\xa4there this meaning: In her poem, the weak character is no longer abstract - she has received a voice.'

b'Blocking criticisms
a'The father of our country knew something of bad press.'
''Americans loved George Washington, but it didn't take long for the newspapers to shut him down because of everything, from the interior politics to his political principles.'
a'He shivered at the criticism, surely.'
a'But he hasn't brought his critics to silence.'
A'Dennis in 1783 said Washington: "The speechlessness can be taken away - and, dull and stumbled, we are like the shepherds for slaughter."'
''That brings me to Maryland to Governor Larry Hogan, who has to work on being more like Washington.'
A'Hogan's staff have blocked the attr\xc3\xa4ge of at least 450 people and gel\xc3\xb6scht their opinion on his official Facebook page.
a'Until the American Civil Liberties Union filed it because of that, this week.'
b'The squad of the Governor enforced\xc3\x9f the lawsuit as frivolous, and the online comment was full of an objection with "Na, and?".'
b'"It's just Facebook," many people said.'
a'But it's important.'
''And it's especially important when it's a guy like Hogan.'
''Thes is a republican governor in a \xc3 \xbcberw \xc3 \xa4ltially democratic state, which is eminently popular.'
b'He has the second\xc3\xb6chest approval of the 50 Governors of the Nation.'

A'He was also very bold in using Facebook as a primary\xc3\xa4res means to connect with his w\xc3\xa4hlers and playfully debunk his hairless head after chemotherapy on his site.
b'There is the blocking of individuals coming to the site of the Governor - which is a \xc3\xb6government forum that is described as official and run by staff members familiar with \xc3\xb6government.
''In an interview with The Washington Post, Hogan's spokesman Amelia Chasse defended the actions of the governor and argued that blocking comments was nothing more than a moderation.'
'But it's too easy to use the image of trolls or spammers or hasslef\xc3\xbcllten people who are going to swing the pearl online.'
''The Post spoke to some of the real people who were blocked by Hogan.'
''Unless those are only real people speaking with their gew\xc3\xa4hlten F\xc3\xbchrers: a teacher, an entrepreneur, and a parish priest, no trolls.'
b'They all said their comments were respectful, thoughtful, and not profane.'
''The parish quoted the Bible in his post and appealed to Hogan's Catholic faith.'

A'Tumbling Celebrates 750 Years of St. Hilda's Church'
A'750 Years of St. Hilda's Church: Anl\xc3\xa4ssince the anniversary\xc3\xa4ums of the church will be held on the old cemetery estate in Tumlingen on Sunday, July 16 at 16.30 p.m
''With its idyllic location and c\xc3\xb6ner views of the township, the historic St. Hilarius area is a popular place to stay.'
''The visitors of the sixth Benefits Sale k\xc3\xb6nnen be blown away by this powerful place.'
''The salvation and preservation of the \xc3\xa4ltest prayer\xc3\xa4udes in the place have made the friends and F\xc3\xb6rderer Tumlingens to their cause.'
A'Walter Martini notes: "It's a unique d\xc3\xb6rfful little thing".'

''The Patronage Law originated from the fr\xc3\xbchmedieval property law.'
'Any one who built, equipped, and condemned a church with a parish, remained evicted of this church and was able to repossess this proprietorship as well.'
b'Thereby connected was the right to amend a parish or propose to the bishop a new parish.'
A'Drei Old\xc3\xa4re were given in the church and two Gloves on the turf.'
A'The gr\xc3\xb6\xc3\x9fere of the two broke down at Christmas 1673.'
A'The newly acquired glove ert\xc3\xb6nte then first be issued in 1692, but had to be sp\xc3\xa4ter in the Second World War in 1942.'
A'In the 30-j\xc3\xa4hr War (1616 to 1648), the window chandeliers were assaulted and the glove seat stolen.'

A'Also, organisers invite the friends and F\xc3\xb6rderer Tumlingens to join them on Sunday, July 16, for the sixth Serenade on the old cemetery to St. Hilarius's cemetery.'
A'Created this by the combo of Kepler High School's Freudenstadt and with word-by-word\xc3\xa4gen by Kurt K\xc3\xbcbler and Reinhold Matteis.'
''Orphaned Hartmut Romans speaks the final word.'
a'The program begins at noon.'
b'Afternoon will be at 15.30 p.m.'
''From the outset of the Serenade, there will be a turntover before the graveyard.'
A'"Genie\xc3\x9fen a summer evening under the shade of old b\xc3\xa4ume and with the wide view \xc3\xbcber woods to the forest," the organisers put out the fantastic view.
a'The Serenade takes place only at dry weather.'

a'How an activist came to learn the answer to the question: "Whose Streets?"'
A'On August 9, 2014, Brittany Ferrell was blown up to her core\xc3\xbcttert.'
A'Just a day after she arrived in New York City,\xc3\x9f the in St. Louis Geborene sat on the bed of an Airbnb apartment she rented and scrolled through Facebook on her phone.'
b'She stumbled upon \xc3\xbcber a post from someone from high school.'
b'"The police just killed an 18-year-old girl, and it's still on the street\xc3\x9fe," he said\xc3\x9f it there.'
A'Very confused, since no one else had posted the information on their feed, they closed Facebook and \xc3\xb6ffe Twitter.'
'A user with the hand of @TheePharoah was retweeted st\xc3\xa4ndig on their timeline.'
A'The rapper from the area of St. Louis was involved in the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed black 18-year-old, who was shot by a we\xc3\x9fen policeman in Ferguson, Missouri.
A'He posted a picture of Brown's lethal K\xc3\xb6rper, which was stretched out on the Stra\xc3\x9fe and there for four hours remaining w\xc3\xbcrde.'
a'"That's wild," thought Ferrell at once.'
'But death was f\xc3\xbcr she and her community nothing new.'
A'She put down her phone to sp\xc3\xa4ter at night to tweet \xc3\xbcber people on the Canfield drive to \xc3\xbcck.'
A'There were photos of the police band and people crying, and of a man pretending to be Brown's father wearing a sign with the caption: "Ferguson police just killed my uncle's son\xc3\xc3;"
b'She watched a live feed where a policeman stood before a group of protesters with a buzzing dog.'
A'In another video, she said, another cop encircled his gun and shouted: "I will kill you... animals all t\xc3\xb6ten."'
b'"That's not \xc3\xbcblich," Ferrell recalled her statement.'
b'"This is not the kind of murder we gew\xc3\xb6hnt and that we typically call k\xc3\xb6nnen."'
A'In this moment f\xc3\xbchlte I c\xc3\xbcttelfrost.'
A'I was w\xc3\xbctend and weighed in."'
A'She buried a R\xc3\xbcck flight and went home on the n\xc3\xa4chest day.'
A'Just after the latter's arrival at 23 p.m., she picked up her 6-j\xc3\xa4hren daughter from the house of her father and agreed that the two of them would drive to Ferguson on the n\xc3\xa4ch
b'What happened in the following three years with Ferrell and Ferguson is the subject of a new documentary, "Whose Streets?", in the theatres on Oct. 11.'
b'It's a story of \xc3\x9cber life and protest, of love and loss, of St\xc3\xa4rke and the resistance that exists from the perspective of the people who live in the community and the people who live in the
A'As Ferrell drove with her daughter, who wore a floral dress and a matching crown, down to Ferguson, the two agreed to a discourse, which she unz\xc3\xa4hligely began this morning.
b'"You remember how I taught you, when black people f\xc3\\xc3\\xc3\\xc3\\xc3\\xc3\\xc3\\xc3\\xc3\\xc3\\xc3\\xc3
A'"We're going to Ferguson now because the police got an 18-year-old boy get\xc3\xb6t and that wasn't right.'
b'I couldn't take them with me," said Ferrell sp\xc3\xa4ter.'
b'"What happened today is a H\xc3\xb6he point of view of what happened in the past.'
a'She must know it and see it and be lifted up in it.'
''She must have been well developed, not only activism and organization, but also knowing the different layers of black experience and black constitution and what we do m\xc3\xbcssen to be free to be ourselves.'
b'Assuming I have the Gl\xc3\xbcck to give her an experience where she pers\xc3\xb6nly doesn't experience any egregious racism, she is not different from the n\xc3\xxa4
A'I have the Gef\xc3\xbchl, I w\xc3\xbcrde render her a bad service, keeping her from doing so."'
b'The first station, when they arrived in Ferguson, was at South Florissant Road, a place against\xc3\xbcber the policebeh\xc3\xb6rde, which became a campground when the activists took to the streets to protest.
''During the day Ferrell and her daughter connected with a local c\xc3\xa4ftsinner, who made lunch.'
a' They calculated bags and helped distribute them to protesters.'
A'Last year, a new kind of activism began to take f\xc3\xbcr Ferrell's form.'
A'"My activism has totally vanished after the 9th of August," she said and admitted that she was a student at the University of Missouri-St. Louis Pr\xc3\xa4sidency.
b'"I had no experience in organizing.'
b'It's all come to an end."'
A'weeks sp\xc3\xa4ter Ferrell met w\xc3\xa4hrend a night-of-democracy Sabaah Folayan, one of the co-directors of the film.'
A'Folayan said she and her cameraman Lucas Alvarado-Farrar only wanted to "document" what happened.'
b'A question Ferrell came up with: "Would you document or try to find a story that will exploit you k\xc3\xb6nnt?"'
A'These skepticisms were generated by unz\xc3\xa4hlige F\xc3\xa4lle of people gen\xc3\xa4hrt, often of Wei\xc3\x9fen - in a community that was

A'Folayan had already worked with the then co-director Damon Davis, a K\xc3\xc3 writer from the area that is f\xc3 intrigued by his activism rumoured to be about to kill innocents.'
A'Sending his commitment, Ferrell brought the project n\xc3\xa4her, along with six other immigrants following the team of "Whose Streets?" in the years after Brown's arrest\xc3\x9fung.'
b'"This documentary is not someone who talks f\xc3\xbcr to us or talks to us. We talk," Davis said.'
b'"That was the main thing f\xc3\xbcr me about how these people are being presented, because so I will be presented."'
b'The goal wasn't to focus on Ferrell's experience - to show that it's not about the movement "not a Messiah-F\xc3\xbchrer, but a community that comes together," Folayan said - she said she's been "

A'"I f\xc3\xbchlte me like naked," Ferrell said and laughed as she looked at the finished product for the first time.'
b'"But I have understood that there must be a certain disproportionate amount of damage done to this work and to the disproportionate amount of black people."'
''Dar\xc3\xbcber beyond Ferrell's story, Ferrell repeats the role of black women in the broader Black Lives Matter movement.'
A'ZERO of the three gr\xc3\xbcnder of the movement, which led after the t\xc3\xb6tung of black teen Trayvon Martin in 2012 the film "BlacklivesMatter" was promoted in social media.
A'"Black, white women in F\xc3\xbchrungs positions have contributed to the movement overall," Ferrell said, "and therefore, we k\xc3\xc3\xa4mping we st\xc3\xc3\
A'black, black women m\xc3\xbcs carry the main burden of everything."'
A'Folayan agreed, pointing out that "the movement is really held up by black women and many black women".'
A'She, however, insists that "this is not an affirmative type of action," where Ferrell was chosen because of her identity\xc3\xa4t as the heart of the film.'
b'"She was the person who put this energy onr\xc3\xbctte," she said.'
b'"It is no coincidence, though she was at present, because at a lifetime at these crossroads, as a black, black woman, there is so much on the line.'
b'You can channel their energy through the screen sp\xc3\xbc."'
''Inzwischen, the news cameras in Ferguson l\xc3\xa4ngst have disappeared, but the racial ties between the community and police continue to exist.'
A'Ferrell is on Bew\xc3\xa4hrung f\xc3\xbcr 2\xc2\xbd years for blocking an intersection at a demonstration.'

b'"I have to take George Ratzinger into account," says Heseman, "for all this had nothing to do with him," he wertest the results of the final report.'
''What exactly stands for in the 440-page report prepared by the Archdiocese of Regensburg with the Aufkl\xc3\xa4rung Associate Justice Ulrich Weber?'
A'In fact, 547 Regents' Doms were "with high platitudes\xc3\xa4t" victims of \xc3\x9cber attacks, 67 Doms were sexually abused, and a number of Doms were sexually

b'Of course, many c\xc3\xbcler raise his "manhood."'
b'Of course, he also appears as a choreographer and perfectionist, who became the \xc3\x96fter handgreifed when a Domspatz did not bring musically a top-notch performance.'
a'How do you consider as his biograph this final report?'
A'Michael Heseman: When you make the M\xc3\xbche and read the whole 440 page long report from the front page, you have to wonder rather, why the name George Ratzinger \xc3\xbcbecause it's the name
''I'm just given eight pages and he'll be cleared of any allegation of mid-life or complicity in the shameful F\xc3\xa4llen sexual harassment.'
A'A lot of the violence exacerbated at preschool occurred au\xc3\x9ferrent to its effectssph\xc3\xa4re.'
''You can all accuse him of having learnt of it sp\xc3\xa4t or having taken first and foremost of it not seriously enough.'
A'The Dom's gymnasium, on which he was performing, was emphasized by practically all the respondents as - so w\xc3\xb6rly - "Erl\xc3\xb6sung", "History" and "
A'So even the broad majority of his c\xc3\xbcler George Ratzinger puts out a quite exaggerated testimony, describing him as "warm-hearted," "beautiful," "compliant," "competent,"
A'Long time ago, a minority complained \xc3\xbcber its perfectionism and its high emotions \xc3\xa4t, which, too, had been to wutausbr\xc3\xbcchens f\x
A'That he did not just hit with st\xc3\xchlen and warp the Schl\xc3\xchlen bundle up to the ground, but also spread ear-piercing and all manner of freaky boys at the hair or ears.
b'To his honour, however, it must be said that such educational methods were widely used in the fracturing period, the 1960s and 1970s, at parents as at teachers.'
a'Do you even know of those z\xc3\xbcchtigungs methods?'
A'Nat\xc3\xbcrlich, I think every one of us who was born before 1968.'
''Anyway, I have experienced this even in a welcoming school, a state ward.'
''Contrary to what is actually going on in this report, n\xc3\xa4m of endangering sexual harassment and the violence exacerbated on preschool, those are freely abused.'
b'Now you're starting to wonder if it's not rather related to his popularity and his role as a brother of Benedict XVI, that many media are just focused on him st\xc3\xbcrzten.'
''At the bay of the Papist, there are many who have never understood him, yet are still eavesdropping.'
''The truth though is: The report enlightens George Ratzinger in every respect!'
''In the media, in relation to the report, there has been very much \xc3\xbcber the issue of abuse at the Regensburger Domspawns.'
a'Were George Ratzinger in the final report also to blame any conspiracy or complicity in relation to sexual harassment?'
A'Michael Heseman: Ganz clearly no.'
''No single one of the 67 victims of sexual \xc3\x9cbergriffes claims to have consented to the Domicile Master.'
a'Not once were the parents admitted.'
A'"I never got to talk to my father or mother dar\xc3\xbcber," said a victim flanked f\xc3\xbcr the others, "It was all very petty."
''The true problem in the surveillance\xc3\xa4rung of sexual abuse was and is yet to be addressed is that most victims are from shame.'
A'If they weren't even parents and siblings at all, then quite possibly not a choir director who was indeed professionally gewisserma\xc3\x9fen a colleague of the T\xc3\xa4ter w\xc3\xa
''How do you evaluate the Dom's s\xc3\xbcler Ratzinger's role in the context of the misogynistic f\xc3\xa4lle?'
A'Michael Heseman: A questioned c\xc3\xcler formulated it like this: "Bez\xc3\xcgly sexual harassment... I... don't see any case where outright he (Georg Ratzinger)
A'I consider it... even f\xc3\xbcr really absurd to assume that outright him... Bubs have been assertive or clearer or even more er\xc3\xb6ffn than against \xc3\xb6ffn
b'That you talk to him \xc3\xbcber sex... - unthinkable."'
A'So the report comes to the very clear conclusion: "That, in advance, affected c\xc3\xbclers and/or their surroundings, could not best\xc3\xa4tigt in the course of the investigation".'
''What sexual harassment concerns, George Ratzinger is also free from any condemnation.'
''So it cannot also be accused of not preventing or bringing him to the notice.'
b'There is also no reason to invoke his good name with these wider \xc3\xa4rtial crimes, as it sadly did in some f\xc3\xa4llen.'
''In the media, there was much of "gewaltexzes" at the Regency Dom's.'
A'Dem fr\xc3\xbchers Domicile Mayor George Ratzinger is presented in the report "Week-By-Week."'
a'Must he live up to this proposition?'
A'Michael Heseman: That's the gro\xc3\x9fe problem that in the reporting, everything was mixed and misunderstood to become a huge mess of sexual abuse and violent extortion and somewhere, right there, George W. Bush's
''But exactly that is again a misconception of the report.'
A'There is n\xc3\xa4mlich cleanly separated: Between the preschool and the ward of the DOM, between sexual abuse and violent extortions as well as, say, any prew\xc3\xbcrfen.'
A'Today, the report presents pref\xc3\xa4lle from the time since 1945, so too from four decades ago, when George Ratzinger was not choreographer of the Doms.'
A'The whole shameful Pr\xc3\xbcgelp\xc3\xa4dagogics, the F\xc3\xa4lle, in which knights of sacred teachers are ruled out and maltr\xc3\xa4
b'Didn't have anything to do with those had Dompiscopal General George Ratzinger, for he got the boys to face only when they were already on the Domspawn gymnasium.'
b'On that day, as the all-time witnesses point out, the topic of "preschool" was tabu.'
A'Man was only gl\xc3\xbcckly able to escape her and enjoyed the so much better treatment and f\xc3\xbcckly many even "paramount" tost\xc3\xa4nde.'
a'What was different on the Dom's gymnasium?'
b'Michael Heseman: There was discipline, but just no sadistic violence.'
A'Unless that's just f\xc3\xbcr George Ratzinger, where the report comes to the conclusion that "some victims of the general humanity of R. sch\xc3\xa4tzten and therefore were found in numerous f\xc
''So, h\xc3\xb6ch remains the presumption of having looked away.'
''Dspite all the efforts\xc3\xbchungs, the report could only define two timer\xc3\xa4ume, in which it was reported by the tost\xc3\xa4ndens on the preschool.'
A'The first time in 1970/71, when he was just beginning to emerge and was told by the Vorg\xc3\xa4ngs at a school where he just didn't act and be responsible, (as the witness) nothing h\xc3\xb/

b'Darin advises this, "that in preschool, continue to be practiced the Pr\xc3\xbcgel punishment".'
b'Shortly, at the risk of negative press coverage, he emphasized urgency.'
A'That was nat\xc3\xbcrlich to a time when legal clarity was assured, when pr\xc3\xbcgel laws were also prohibited in California l\xc3\xa4ngst.'
b'That's why they occurred in a legal gray zone, like every one of us probably still wei\xc3\x9f.'

a'How do you see this?'
A'Michael Heseman: We historians talk there about the "fault of anachronism," also the danger of comparing past to today's moral ma\xc3\x9fst\xc3\xa4ben.'

A'But that's nat\xc3\xc3\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\
''This is all quite scary and I'm glad it's finally worked on.'
'But at the same time, I must take George Ratzinger into account, for all this had nothing to do with him.'
''Second means of discipline and bestowal, such as obedience and pulling at the hair and ears, were widely used in the 1970s.'
A'Although k\xc3\xb6rperceived then to be prohibited, he has also strictly opposed it.'
A'Who's picture of his Regency time did George Ratzinger have in the Gespr\xc3\xa4chen with you f\xc3\xbcr the book "My Brother the Pope"?'
b'Kam the issue of Pr\xc3\xbcgel punishment is also to be brought to the fore?'
A'Michael Heseman: Now, in that book, indeed, it is about the life of his brother Joseph, also Pope Benedict XVI, hez\xc3\xa4hlt from his perspective, since the Doms played only a secondary role.'
''Trouble is, I don't presume no one else there was a strict regime f\xc3\xbchrte.'
