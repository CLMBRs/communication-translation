I 1856: Four maps that change your view of the city
The Ivy League, where today teenagers are supposed to meet.
The Grumpy Chapel, which is now being erected for the S-Bahn Tunnel.
The farmers are responsible for the acreage of farmers.
It’s the oldest official map of the city that encourages exciting stories to come to light.
I hate when maps are not up-to-date.
If you know anyone who has been on the road for a while, you know that the car navigation system instead of a conversion road indicated a greenway.
The historical land maps of the digital California attraction, a service provided by the Geoportal California of the State of California, are all too up-to-date - yet just as very informative.
If you compare them to current online cards.
I will be able to see how cities and towns have changed in the distribution of the Mercury Mercury since the 19th century.
I think the digital Bayern attraction is a flaw that you don't recognize as such.
The large map was designed for cities and counties to include detailed maps, called urn maps.
It was created by the Bay Area Vermeery Survey between 1802 and 1864 and encompassed the first Vermeery Survey of the United States.
The Client: Napoleon Bonaparte.
The French army has defended Bayern since the spring of 1800 during the Second Battle with Austria.
I wish to give you a glimpse of the occupied country and give you a topographical snapshot of Bayern in order - naturally to military purposes.
The French victory with the Peace of Luneville ended in 1801, but it was the today’s neighbors who sparked the idea of a square-shaped Bayern map.
The forty-year-old Joseph continued to pursue the project, founding the "Topography Bureau" - and thus the Bay Area Vermeer's Office.
It was issued for Chicago in 1856 and is as well available on the website of the Chicago Public Library.
The comparison early/early is at the expense of the state capital.
The city has expanded in all directions and is becoming cohesive.
The example of this is Undersendling, which is still relatively isolated.
Iling was incorporated 21 years after the map, so 1877, as a suburb.
The underground parking lot is located right in the city.
The houses underneath are situated around 1856 along the present Plymouth Road, which was only named after George Sebastian Plymouth, a leader of the struggle of British farmers against Austria 1705.
In today's Westpark, you can see nothing but fields - on the surface: At the Hint, you're greeted by a small scale map with dull lines and numbers: hand-drawn rivers from the denominated "Urban Survey," from which the Grund
This parish now has no farmers - but small farmers of the facility "Land in the Sun".
The large green space is narrowly separated from underneath.
The Therese Field, since 1810 Schauspiel Field of the Oktoberfest, was in the 19th century actually still a field - and no concrete wall.
The other side of the Isle gives the historical map a glimpse into the history of psychiatric medicine.
The urn reads in the area of the present district of Au-Haidhausen not only the street name "am Gail" or of the elevation "On the Lake" - but also in large booklets "Irish Anchor".
I remember, here at Auburn, you were assaulting people with delusions.
It was 1858/59 that the Michigan County Immigration Office "On the Auburn Lake" was formed.
It was 1872 that Dr. Bernhard of Gudden founded the facility - jealousy of the death of Prince Charles.
It was fortuitous for its time and ended the association of the denomination of Irrigation.
"He has ordered the personnel not to use force against the inmates," says Hermann Wilhelm, director of the Museum Haidhausen, which has been working on an exhibition with the incident.
The 280 patients were initially reserved, later expanded to 500.
This capacity did not last long - the reason for the construction of the Kreisirre in Haarlem.
The Isle of Man is home to the Isle of Man Psychiatric Hospital, one of the largest psychiatric hospitals in the United States.
The ashes of the former Auburnian asylum now begegnees teenage girls in the Montrose Salesian's sanctuary.
The Order acquired the building in 1920 and transformed it into a youth hostel with training facilities.
This is the football field of the Twenty Century Fox East, north facing homesteads from the 1980s.
I built the children's house "Casa Don Bosco" - in architectural respect to the origin of the Irrigation facility which was destroyed in 1942 at bomb blasts.
The Marilyn Place was recorded in 1856 as a "Haupt Place," the Kaufman Gas Station was called "Kaufelt Gas Station".
The decisive change brought the Second World War also to the heart of Chicago.
The bombs of the Allies ripped through December 1944 many holes in the city.
The big remained until today - at Marilyn's.
The English Institute, small business buildings and a Gruesome Chapel from the Middle Ages stood atop the Marilyn Manor, where these days are the preliminary works and on April 5th will be the spawn of the second S-Bahn station.
The slider lets you compare the old Michigan map to the air map of today - and fill the hole at Marilyn's.
Immigration rights group published travel ban for Missouri
The National Association for the Protection of Colored People has issued a warning to colored people who travel because of discrimination and the racist attacks of the state to Missouri.
The NAACP Travel Advisory for the state of Missouri, which is due to take effect by August 28, 2017, urges African American travelers, visitors and Missourians to pay attention when traveling through the state and to take extreme caution as a number of the state’s major tourist attractions
The recently passed law of Missouri that makes it harder for people to win discrimination cases, as well as the criminal courts of the state that are unfair to minorities, forced the group to release the travel warning.
I have violations of civil liberties that happen to people.
"For their skin color, they are arrested or killed," said the president of the Missouri NAACP, Rod Chapel, the Kansas City Star.
"We hear complaints in a way that we have not heard before."
The first such warning has been issued by the organization for a state in the United States.
The group cited incidents such as racist attacks against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, 28, a black man from Tennessee.
The 33-year-old died under frail circumstances earlier this year after he had stopped driving while traveling through the state and was arrested by the police of Missouri without being charged with any crime.
The Rat also pointed to a recently released report from the Office of the General Counsel of Missouri, in which it is shown that black drivers in the state are 75 percent more likely to be arrested than white drivers.
"The recommendation is that the people be aware and inform their families, friends and staff of what could happen in Missouri," Chapel said.
"The people have to be ready to pay whatever amount it takes or let the relatives know they are going through the state."
The state recorded in 2015 100 hate crimes, according to the latest figures from the hate crime report of the FBI, which ranks the state in terms of the number of such crimes on the 16th place in the country.
The travel ban is also a response to a new Missouri law that would make it difficult for a company to file for housing or employment discrimination.
The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) issued travel bans for Texas and Arizona after the states passed a law requiring local law enforcement to arrest people for illegal immigration violations.
The warnings are issued by the U.S. government for other countries, but in recent years interest groups have used the measure as a response to certain laws and trends within the U.S.
Iidezaun project is elementary
The Fischerbacher Wetland Project is a success and will be continued in the near future.
The Republican candidates Peter White and Cory Kovac have been allowed to take a picture.
In the right-of-way of the family, representatives of the Fisherman’s Village Council met with Mayor Tom Schneider and the two borough councillors.
It was Schwendemann who first gave a glimpse into his farm, which houses 55 acres of grass and 40 acres of woodland, 40 dairy farms and assorted bird sanctuaries and houses in five homesteads holidaymakers.
The "Schwarzmilk" is for him the alternative distribution channel for the milk of his cows, according to Schwendeman.
The table of the holiday guests comes exclusively from regional.
The heiress, who is also BLHV's chairman of Fishery, described the wetland project as "elementary important".
I can’t operate on such slender surfaces.
The green space provides for much work, many of which need to be done with the motorsense.
"We have to fight here with the conditions and with the topography," Schwendeman said.
I have taken over the elderly farm and manage this without chemical fertilizers and fertilizers even though I don’t run a bio farm.
The Mayor Thomas Schneider was clear: "The community has recognized the importance of the wetland project and is pleased with the Leader's grant".
The cost of $3,000 to $4,000 per hectare would have to be supported by the farmers.
I hope that with that, the exploration of the area could be extended another whole year.
"The biggest blessing we have is the people who work in the farming sector and are thinking about how they can continue their business," said the Mayor.
The farmers stand out because of the subsidies often placed in the spotlight
The Wetland Conservation Fund received in 2013 total 25 parchments from eleven participants.
The off-season area is estimated to be 40 acres which must be extinguished by 2023.
The total cost was $71,500, of which half was funded through Leaders, a fourth was sponsored by the village of Fishery.
I spent the landlords 12 610 dollars that they had to invest in 16,2 miles of wetland.
"The big advantage is the long-term durability of the shed," said Schwendeman.
Idula Kovac said: "I think you're doing a right good job without landlords and landfrauds".
"For Peter White, this is where best food is produced".
The landscape protection plan (LPR) of the United States allows the government to subsidize the construction of dams.
It is the offspring of the Black Hole.
The availability of a by the LPR designated fund.
I agree that the aforementioned area should not be cut down (hanging over 35 percent) and must be protected from the surveillance.
The Fisherman’s Wetland Project 2018 is currently running the application of eight participants with 24 parches that want to build nearly 16 miles of wetland.
The off-site area is 35 acres, the estimated cost is more than 112,500 euros.
It's nothing more precious?
The White House takes the liberty of Trump the freedom of speech
The sure sign of a Regime weakness is when they start attacking the statues.
The Americans value these as much as any other - hence the carefully crafted collapse of Saddam Hussein on the Firdos field in Iraq in 2003.
The Miller, one of the key ideologues of the Trump campaign, certainly knew what he was doing when he used a symbolic axe in a fierce debate with Jim Acosta of CNN about the proposals made by the president to drastically restrict legal immigrants with to freedom of movement.
If fair enough, Miller did not touch the statue himself.
The horde of boat owners and Liberty Impressionists would have lynched him if he had done it.
Ignore their significance, and especially the significance that was given to them when the famous poem by Emma Lazarus, composed 17 years after the completion of the monument, was added to its basis.
The Miller Acosta commented: "I don't want to go on a complete thing about history, but the Liberty statue is... a symbol of American freedom that illuminates the world.
"The poem you are referring to is later added and is not part of the original freedom statue."
This is sarcastic, but as he himself stated, it doesn’t really relate to storytelling.
I'm talking about the timely resurrection of the on-going words of Lazarus, the only ones in which a state doesn't just invite any old immigrants aboard, but the suffering of the poor: "Dear me, yours, / yours, / your
I never saw a time when the "electronic absorption" was seen better on our screens.
I didn't engage in literary criticism - he made clear that these people weren't welcome in Trump's America.
The conflict due to the significance of a statue is part of a broader political and cultural debate: It is in fact a conflict about the significance of America.
Theus - and her friends who were determined to place their words after her death at the basement - knew very well that they were performing a high-profile act.
The sculpture should show the connections between French and American republicanism by showing in a faded classical painting the weakness of liberty.
Ius changed this meaning: In her poem, the weeping figure is no longer abstract - she has a voice.
“She gives herself a whole other name: Mother of the Exiles.”
The association of the poem with the image is a brilliant feminist co-operation and a brutal attack on the American nativeness.
The exact same way Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, the people from the right side wanted to reverse this long ago.
The big-mouthed Rush Limbaugh, a sort of Johannes the Täter for the coming of Trump, argued 2010, that the Liberty statue shouldn’t attract anyone, but rather be a early neo-liberal symbol that brings the American flame into the umpteenth century:
I shall carry the flag of freedom from the United States into the rest of the world.
"The Faculty shall not illuminate the way in the United States."
I'm surprised Limbaugh is here on something.
The significance of the statue is entirely a matter of the standpoint of reason.
The great phenomena of Lazarus was to see her as she was seen by the elderly, but hopeless people after long and often cruel voyages on the decks of ships.
I’m in the realm of seeing the world from the perspective of people looking for refuge and a chance to improve their lives.
The statue speaks to them the words of hope and welcome they must hear.
This is obviously not the perspective that Miller and Trump would ever want to see.
I don't want to illuminate the way, but the hate that is their only source of power.
The Olympic Games 2017: Neil Black loving the members of the team of Britain
Iilidh Doyle recalls a time when only two Scots were included in the team of Britain
The performance manager of the Leeds United, Neil Black, says that the 16-man hockey team will make a major contribution to the World Championships.
The record number of runners has been selected for London 2017, which starts Friday.
I believe that "sitting in Scotland develops something special" and the Left Coast needs to learn something from it.
"We welcome it, and we try to understand it, and we will continue it until we find it," Black said.
I talk to people in Scottish Institute of Sports and they think it has something to do with what they have done.
The runners think it has something to do with what they did.
It has something to do with what they did.
The same with the guy at the street corner.
"Whatever the combination of circumstances is, it is absolutely brilliant."
The runners are medalists, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butcher - who will be competing against Sir Mo Farah on the 5000 meters, while Eleanor Doyle has been chosen by the team to be team captain.
"Eilidh is pretty bescheiden.
"The Captain's remarks were amazing," says Black.
It was a series of athletes, regardless of their origins or wherever they live or train, going out of the room and feeling very proud and were very motivated.
"The passion and the genuine feeling that elicited it was quite natural."
The Commonwealth Games medallist, who will compete at their fifth Olympic Games at the 400m hurdles, says it's "unfortunate" that 16 Scots are in the British team.
Iowa's best overall number of athletes at the Olympic Games was seven, which were achieved between 1983 and 2015.
The middle-of-the-road racer Muir runs on this track and has set five British and two European records.
I will be competing at the 1500m and the 5000m races.
The O'Hare, who runs 1500 metres, is another Schooner you should watch after a fantastic season that included the victory at the British Team Trials and the Anniversary Games.
It reminds me of my first World Championships when the only other Schooner in the team was Lee McConnell.
The team's captain says she is "extremely proud" of the fact that many of her Landsmen will not only be part of the team, but in some cases will be involved in the Olympics and at the Finals.
The beauty of being Team Captain is that she was chosen by the other members of the team, so it was probably a big honor, but knowing that my teammates voted for me and voted for me makes it something special.
I'm honored to be a part of all the scholarships that come to the team.
I just don’t know how far we’ve come.
I'm here as a established athlete, athlete who wants to be on podium.
“What about my speech as a captain?”
I, I think she went well.
I just wanted to let you know that we are in this situation very happy as we have a home-season.
It is also really important to focus on this home stretch and benefit from it that we are back in Olympia.
"You get a second chance to go there and compete and it will just be such a great atmosphere there."
Ignoring criticism via Facebook: Don’t apply for a public office if you don’t agree with the assault of voters
The father of our country knew something of bad press.
The Americans loved George W. Bush, but it didn’t take long for the newspapers to blame him for everything, from the interior politics to his political principles.
The schizophrenic was schizophrenic at the same time, sure.
It hasn't brought his critics to silence.
"In 1783, Washington said, "The speech may be taken away - and, dumb and stunted, we shall be led like the horses to the slaughter."
It brings me to Maryland to Governor Larry Hogan who has to work hard to be more like Washington.
The company has blocked the posts of at least 450 people who have voiced their opinion on its official Facebook page.
The American Civil Liberties Union filed suit against him earlier this week.
The sworn governor ended the suit as frivolous, and the online commentary was full of a counterargument with "Nah, and?".
"It's just Facebook," said many people.
I think it is important.
I think it's especially important when it's a type like Hogan.
This is a Republican governor in an overcrowded democratic state that is highly popular.
I have the second highest approval of the 50 governors of the Nation.
I'm not a reactionary heat gun.
I have a firm hand in leading his state and strict enforcement of the principles.
I was also very keen to use Facebook as a prize to connect with his voters and playfully depict his hairy head after chemotherapy on his side.
The blocking of individuals coming on to the side of the Governor - which is a public forum that is officially recognized and operated by staff paid with public tax dollars - is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous.
In an interview with The Washington Post, Hogan’s spokesperson Amelia Chasse defended the actions of the governor and argued that blocking comments was nothing more than a moderation.
I think it is too easy to use the image of trolls or spammers or hassle-free people who are online pushing the peeps.
The Post spoke to some of the really people who were blocked by Hogan.
This is just real people talking to their elected leaders: a teacher, a businessman and a pastor, no trolls.
I all agreed that their comments were respectful, thought-provoking and not profane.
The pastor quoted the Bible in his post and appealed to Hogan’s Catholic faith.
The lawyer Lakshmi Sarma Ramani of Bowie, Md., was not hassled, but she asked for hate crimes.
"I commented sternly that I was disappointed that there was no response to hate crimes and other recent news," she wrote in the comments section of the news channel "The Post".
"I don't agree with this idea either, when a number of people take up the same issue, then they are seen by some rather than a so called collective effort and not recognized as a large group of affected citizens".
The staff of the governor's office called it a "conspiracy spat" would likely call others "fake news."
The Facebook algorithm makes it easy to delete a message by simply blocking a comment or deleting a negative comment.
This is much cleaner than in earlier days when you would have done the same thing that employees were enlisted to collect newspapers with critical Leiter articles and burn them or arrest demonstrators and put them to shame.
The exact same thing is happening right now digitally.
I'm not the first public figure to be criticized for criticizing Facebook and other social media.
The president is accused of blocking Twitter users who have been blocked from his Twitter feed.
The first milestone in this question fell last week in Virginia.
The chairman of the Board of Supervisors of Loudoun County suffered the First Amendment, according to US Senator James C. Cacheris in Alexandria, when she banned a candidate from their Facebook page.
In Kentucky, Governor Matt Bevin (R) also received a visit from the ACLU due to his use of Facebook and Twitter.
I shouldn't have been that hard.
The time Washington had had the same effect on the e-commerce industry as the Internet.
The number of newspapers declined between 1776 and 1800, and anonymous letter-writers threw pressure on his leadership.
I myself remember when Washington had anonymous trolls.
The people who used pseudonyms such as "Julius", "Valentino", "Belisario" and "Porto" wrote all letters to newspapers that defended Washington's decisions.
The petitions that questioned his stand on the contract of Amity, the trade and the ships with Britain, overturned his office, according to the historical documents collected from the online papers of the George Washington Project.
“He hasn’t brought her to silence.”
I believe that democracy, pluralism and dissent are the foundation of our Nation.
I believe true leadership means accepting that.
Ian Rafferty hopes to have high-quality comfort in Renaissance Club
The former Euro Open winner Ronan Rafferty will in the next three days hope for home comfort as the Renaissance Club in East Lothian hosts the 25th edition of the Scottish Senior Open.
The Nordire, who finished ahead in Archerfield Links to reach the final before losing to Paul Eales, is associated with the new venue and serves as tournament ambassador in honor of the club’s founder and CEO Jerry Sarvadi.
"I have seen how the Renaissance Club was built, and we will see how it achieves its glory," Rafferty said.
The players will see this course from its best, he is in a great condition.
I think he did a great job when he fixed this place.
I am an eavesdropper of this game and am proud of his performance here.
"This is a great spot for this course."
In England, Eales is pleased to win for the first time a championship, although he has won in his 32-year career both at the European Tour and at the European Challenge Tour.
"That feels really special," said the in Southport belonging to the club.
I have not defended the Extremadura Open as it was withdrawn in the year after I won it.
I return to this part of the world is magical.
I think it is a wonderful place to play golf.
The memories from last year come back, and it was something special for me and my wife Sharon to win last year here.
"It was a truly special time and one that we will always treasure."
The Orr, who arrived after his 50th birthday earlier this year to the European Senior Tour, returns to the action on home base.
The event will be his first Scottish Open since the Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013.
"It means a lot more when you play at home," said Orr, the man from Helensburgh.
I want to make it look good, but you feel this extra pressure.
I really enjoyed playing again, and I had a solid golf swing.
"I am pleased with how it has gone."
The trio on the field are the former Masters champion Ian Woosnam and the senior Major Champions Paul Broadhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNulty.
Ther and the former Ryder Cup captain Sam Torrance are among the six scouts on the field, the others are Andrew Oldcorn, Stephen McAllister, Bill Longmuir and Ross Drummond.
The entrance is free, the parking fee is £5 per car with an occupant and £10 per car with two or more occupants.
The proceeds will go to Prostate Cancer UK.
I've been diagnosed with LSD by Passive Lyme Disease
In the past two decades, fewer people have died from passing cocaine to LSD.
The finding comes from researchers at the University of Edinburgh in a study.
"Ninety percent of our estimates are prone to suicide, with 167 suicides attributable to passive smoking," said study co-author Heiko Becher.
The comparison drew up a separate study on this topic from 1994.
I remember there were still 400 LSD cases related to passing drug use per year in the U.S.
The new study is published in the "International Journal of Public Health".
I've found the protocols to be very complex
The construction in the Vicksburg Road is in full swing and "living sometime in time," according to the director of the construction department Fred Heinz.
In the area of house connections, the location was complicated as there was in the underground lot much that was not included in the plans.
The traffic, which continues to impede the construction, poses for the construction crew of the company Stumpp a great deal of trouble.
"The ignorance of the drivers before red acrobats and abs are already enormous," he says.
The road was closed and only the line buses were allowed to pass through.
In addition to Caruso, Marvin Kosciusko and Tim Kosciusko of the company Stumpp have been busy with the construction of the bridge.
The hot days were already quite an ordeal.
"Today we were greeted by our friend Fritz Matt with warm mineral water," Marvin Kostorz says.
Immigration and death in the Indian Gold Coast
The Bard Degei cooks the dinner, she doesn’t use a stove.
It even only uses a top.
In her wooden house in Enarotali, the capital of the Paniai province in the unspoilt northern province of Papua New Guinea, the housewife normally puts a slice of sugarcane - locally called "nota" - right into the fireplace.
In a matter of a minute, the dried bone is removed with wet, unwashed hands and discarded.
Igei sits on the leather chair - she doesn't have any furniture - where she also performs her daily chores, such as wash clothes with dirt water from the nearby supper table.
The egg in a damp room serves as latrine.
The youngest of the four widowed husbands, she was given no field.
I think it is common here.
The late work can be dangerous: Most villagers are employed, and many drink hard, and there are here the soldiers.
"No one wags it after 17 o'clock in the village," she says.
This is a rare glimpse into the daily life of Papua New Guinea, a former holistic colony that was incorporated in 1969 after a controversial referendum in Indonesia, when only 1.026 young people were identified by a public hand-picked survey before the invasion.
The existing movement, which fought for the unity of the holistic regime, quickly turned its attention to the government of Jakarta, which maintains the control over the region and excludes foreign journalists or legal observers from it.
The province was officially divided into Papua New Guinea and West Papua, although the independent part of Papua New Guinea covered the northern part of the island.
Iarotali is as remote as it is boring. The trip includes a 90-minute flight from the province of Jayapura to Maharashtra and then a morning 5-hour drive with the taxi.
I don't have public transportation.
The city with about 195,000 residents is composed of wooden buildings that are surrounded by brick walls, and from well-painted concrete staircases, which have been transformed by roaring in various yellow tones.
The very few Indonesians who have made their way here have been journalists and practically no Asians.
The Christian missionaries honored Mee Pago Papuans a god called Ugga Tamee.
I also noticed other changes.
"We weren't used to wearing these clothes," says Degei and depicts her leafy, handsome turtleneck, her dark jacket and her bright rock.
"Furthermore, we had only leaves at our bodies."
This is Indonesia’s poorest province, where 28 percent of people live under the poverty line and have some of the worst child death rates in Asia.
“It is also Indonesia’s gold-richest country.
The largest and most profitable gold mine in the world, Grasberg, in the possession of Freeport McMoran from Phoenix, is just 60 miles from Paniai, a coastal town in the size of New Jersey with 153,000 residents.
This year Freeport has lost $3 billion worth of gold and precious metals.
In addition, Papua has wooden resources worth $78 billion.
The riches are however a source of elbow grease for the Papuans, who ensure that Indonesia’s powerful military has an enduring presence.
The investigation of 2005 in the New York Times reported that Freeport paid local military officers and units between 1998 and 2004 nearly $20 million, including up to $50,000 to a single officer.
Then Ford’s demands for greater autonomy threaten these golden goats and are rejected.
This year, according to activists, more than 300,000 Papuans have been killed and hundreds have been kidnapped since 1969 by Indonesian military forces.
Isentence in Papua New Guinea in the 1970s was declared by the Asia-Pacific Human Rights Commission to be genocide.
This year in the region, the Indian government arrested more than 3.500 peaceful demonstrators.
"We Weren All Lost" according to a report from the Archdiocese of Brisbane from 2016, in which accounts of grievances of the previous year are included, such as unlawful kidnappings and rape - rape and electrical attacks are included.
"It is difficult to count the number of victims as every week incidents happen," says Andreas Harsono, Indonesian researcher for Human Rights Watch.
This has become more frequent as Papua New Guinea resources bring a supply of sheep from other parts of Indonesia.
The population of 3.5 million of the province is to 83 percent Christian, but the population is changing as Muslim economic migrants come from the tropical islands of Java, Borneo, Sumatra and Sulawesi.
The Thai Warrior's sells baked beans and gyro sauce, a mix of vegetables served with olive oil.
I'm fighting to stay here with you.
"The Migrants have started selling chickens and vegetables on the traditional market cheaper than the local Papuans," says Abeth You, a 24-year-old Paniai Indian who arrived in the province of Jayapura to work.
"It has cost the aforementioned Papuan women - the Mama-Mama [the women] of Papua - their market."
The Indonesian president, in popularity known as Jokowi, promised during his campaign 2014 to address the unrest and the rights abuses in Papua New Guinea.
The former Zimmerman secured 27 of the total 29 districts of Papua - including Paniai - on the way to the president's palace in Jakarta.
In Papua New Guinea, things have changed little, and today the locals feel they are being abused.
"Unfortunately, our hearts are broken because we voted 2014 for Jokowi, with the expectation that he will fulfill our hopes of restoring the peace again," You said.
In contrast, Paniai suffered only two months after Jokowi’s inauguration in October a downturn.
The 7th of December 2014, a group of 11 children were outside and sang Christmas songs before a campfire in Enarotali, when two Indian soldiers on a motorcycle broke through the darkness.
I hesitantly told them they should turn their flashlights on.
“One of the soldiers took notice of her tone and returned later with four soldiers,” said the local pastor Yavedt Tebai.
The soldiers who had died were hunting and killing the group with their guns, said victims and witnesses.
I fired one of the soldiers into the group of children.
The child, the 16-year-old Yulian Yeimo, was so severely beaten that he fell to the ground.
The few hours later, the building of the nearby government office was in flames and the things escalated the next day.
The 1,000 young Papuan men, women and children gathered on a football field near the local police station and the military commissioner’s office to demand justice.
I wore ceremonial jaggery jackets and led the Waita-tank - in the circle running and a bird singing in the background - from Papua New Guinea's Mee Pago Stadium.
The demonstrators began throwing stones on police and military posts.
"When the mood was up, the soldiers sent a message via an internal communications channel: "If the masses do more than three times resist, they shoot them dead," according to an official document from TIME, which was not released to local media.
Theemias Kayame, 56, the leader of the Kego Koto-Villa of Enarotali, saw the dreadful danger and called for calm and urged the crowd to return home.
I was in the mood to listen.
"When I turned around, I was suddenly shot in my right hand," he said TIME on the veranda of his brightly painted wooden house.
Theme still doesn’t know who escaped, but says that the cub came from the ranks of the here beloved soldiers.
"It was overflowing, many shots were fired," he adds.
The aged man Alfie Youw was shot three times, as was his co-pilot, who was witness to the shootings.
"I ran to him and examined his body to make sure he was it," Yohanes said, who like many Indonesians only wears a name that reads TIME in dim light.
"I saw that he was dead... I've kissed him."
The chief of the Papuan police force, Yotje Mende, told reporters that his officers wanted to protect their station only because it would be attacked.
"We have to defend ourselves when people threaten to kill us," said the spokesman of Papua New Guinea Police Chief Pudji Sulistiyo in 2015.
"It's about life and death."
The Human Rights Watch said five young demonstrators were killed and many others were injured.
The news of the killings came out at the following day 'filtered' to Jakarta.
This week, Jokowi held in Jayapura a leidensive speech, in which he expressed sympathy for the families of the victims and schworked the historical misfortunes in Papua New Guinea.
"I want this case to be solved immediately so that it won't happen in future," he said.
The Minister Wiranto said in October 2016, that he intends to institute an arbitrary process to settle historical human rights abuses.
The excuses began to come almost immediately.
The majority of injuries have occurred before.
I was in the 1990s and early 2000s.
"The point is that we are obliged to address these violations, but there are processes that need to be followed," he said.
It made Wiranto a return as he spoke on June 5 in Jakarta with TIME and said he had no plans to establish in Papua a complaint mechanism.
"Everything is regulated," he said.
Ianto, who has been accused by the U.N. of "crimes against human rights," which resulted in more than 1,000 deaths in East Timor's blunt unrest from 1999, said that 11 cases of human rights violations have already been reported in Papua New Guinea
The Paniai victims took such claims with grim remorse.
"I have been interviewed in the past three years four times, but there was no progress," Yohanes says.
"I'm tired," he said. "I'm tired."
I tell him that years later he still lives in fear.
"I have fear," he says.
"I have fear of being arrested by the military, have fear of being murdered."
The brother Yacobus again reaffirmed the belief that the people in Paniai fear to discuss the incident.
It says that he was shot by the military after he helped save four of the victims.
"When I had died, the military searched for me," he says.
The shootings have not stopped.
This morning, the Indonesian police shot down villagers in Paniai’s neighboring village Deiyai.
In a confrontation between villagers and the manager of a construction company who refused to put a dead man in a hospital, one person died and 17 others were injured, including children.
The man, the 24-year-old Ravianus Douw, who was stabbed when he broke into a nearby river, died on the way to the hospital.
The villagers protested before the location office of the company.
The police said the villagers threw stones on officers who responded by firing warning shots.
Immigration officials say that the mobile force (indonesian paramilitary police force) started shooting on the Mengele and killed one.
"We were so in panic, we have fear that there will be rape," says the 29-year-old Dominggu, who lives near the hospital and witnessed how the victims were taken here quickly, according to the TIME.
"I have hidden myself two days in my house."
The Deirai parliament has called for the involved officers to retaliate and pull the mobile Brigade of the police from the area.
Iai was always an unpleasant one for the Indian government.
The lack of meaningful development hinders the unemployment of the Stammes of Mee, Moni, Dani and Damal, who live in the green hills of Papua New Guinea.
I joined the "Free Papua Movement" (OPM), the rebel army that claims to defend the rights of the Papuans by launching sporadic attacks and enemy encroachments.
The top OPM flagships are from Paniai, including Ted Yogi and Daniel Yuda Kogoya.
In response, in recent years, hundreds of people have been arrested in Paniai and willfully placed in jail, under the guise of "suppression of national sovereignty".
I'll never be able to catch up again.
The people of Papua New Guinea are known as Paniai as a "tragic, forgotten place."
The poverty increases the unemployment.
The bit of rice sold in Enarotali is too expensive for locals.
I am astonished at the range of Reichweite.
The people here build up everything they eat: most of it is bread and fruit and leaves.
The farming is the responsibility of the women who can each manage four or five fields of sugarcane.
I retain the majority of the crop for the family while the rest is sold on the local market.
The piece of note cost only 10.000 Indian rupees (75 cents).
In recent years, economic uncertainties have risen between the ailing Papuan people and the new migrants who have arrived since opening new flight routes to the airport nearby in greater numbers.
The few jobs that exist in the region are in turn going to the better educated and well-paid migrant workers.
I have rarely had the capital or the necessary skills to run my own companies.
"The young people are not interested in staying in the village... because here there is no jobs or money," says John Gobai, the leader of the Stammes of Paniai.
Ilation keeps the eyes of the world away from Papua.
In addition, restrictions on reporting international media remain.
The French journalists Franck Esquire and Basil Longchamp were denied permission to film because of lack of coordination with respectable institutions from Papua despite being given the rare permission to film.
The Phyllis Kine, the Asia-Pacific director of Human Rights Watch, said the promises of Jokowi’s election campaign to lift restrictions on reporting to promote transparency and development were not realistic.
"There are new threats to Indonesian journalists trying to report from Indonesia's undeveloped northern provinces of Papua New Guinea and West Papua: Visa refusals and a blacklist," he said in a statement.
The lack of press control means that the international pressure on the Indonesian government is far from being limited to the immediate vicinity of Papua New Guinea.
In March, six peaceful nations - Tonga, Nauru, Papua New Guinea, Tuvalu, the Marshall Islands and the Salomon Islands - demanded the UN to investigate the "profound and widespread human rights violations" in Papua New Guinea including the
The same countries have historically supported the OPM.
The spokesman for the Indonesian Foreign Minister Armanashi Mehmood wielded the accusations of the group and told reporters in Jakarta: "In Indonesia, there is still a democratic system, and there are free media, so it is difficult to find the evidence for human rights violations."
The people ahead of them want to see more foreign governments take this to heart.
The official delegation from the Netherlands, accompanied by the human rights ambassador Kees Van Baar, visiting Jayapura on May 4, bravely broke their silence and threatened him "We want freedom," according to a source who also spoke to the BBC.
It has 2019 a second presidential election, but the Papuans say they likely won’t vote again for Jokowi.
"Jokowi is a person who has good intentions, but he is surrounded by the people who are involved in the Paniai fights," says Gobai, the chairman of the Stammes Council.
I want to make sure that Jokowi knows that the Paniai population, aside from being under the constant threat of a brutal military presence, is living in arms-of-war facilities.
Iai says that the Paniai people, like other Papuans, view their vote for Jokowi as a "chance" that he has to pay back.
"You don't need money, they just want justice," he says.
The threats and assaults carried out by families of the Paniai suicide victims led to a last symbolic act of solidarity: the body of a victim was found on a site just opposite the police and military station.
I know they may never get justice, but at least they let the responsible for their crimes not forget them.
"A member of our family was killed," says Yacobus with geseated head.
"What else can we do?"
The 'Torch' Wolves of Dubai have been captured for the second time
The fire broke out Friday in one of the highest residential buildings in Dubai its doorstep and forced hundreds of residents to evacuate from the 3,000-square-foot, 79-story building.
The second fire in just two years has broken through the high-rise, which is known to be the Torch Tower (Face Tower).
The building was evacuated, injuries were not reported, and there was no direct word on the cause of the fire.
I woke up and we were at the fire alarm and at the crying of the people.
"I ran down the stairs, and it took about 10 minutes to get up from the 50th floor," said a resident who called his name George angrily, Reuters.
Its civilians said that the units of firefighters fired at 4.00 p.m. (5.00 p.m.) the fire and burnt the building down.
The government said it is working on providing support services for the affected people.
The incident may raise questions about the safety of materials used in exterior walls of high-density buildings across the world.
The investigation by the management of the Torch Village after its fire in 2015 revealed that the majority of the damage came from the ventilation, the exterior decoration or insulation.
In Britain, the police said they believe the system of ignition and ventilation at the London Fire Station in June could have contributed to the racket of a fire that killed about 80 people.
The Davis Cup Final: Continue Best-of-five
The president of the International Tennis Federation (ITF) is upset with his big Davis Cup coveted victory at the General Assembly.
In the meeting in Ho Chi Minh, the for this sport revolutionary proposal to play Davis Cup One only on two wins was hauled up not supported by the required two-thirds vote.
The often very long, but just because very popular Five-Say-Kitch remains the tradition.
I,54 percent of the member states voted for the reform, the goal of ITF President David Haggerty was therefore only knapped.
I respect this decision, but am disappointed that our member nations did not approve the entire reform package for the Davis Cup and Fed Cup.
"We need a change to secure the long-term future of these iconic and historical competitions," Haggerty said.
I will continue to work on improving the recruitment process.
It wasn’t until voting ended after many objections had been made that the proposal was made to hold the Finale at a neutral venue.
It’s just a few minor details: So the finalists in Davis Cup and Fed Cup will now have the first round of the playoffs.
The cost for the organisers will be reduced, the requirements in terms of training facilities etc. will be eliminated and the players will be required to complete prior to the Davis Cup less official media interviews.
If 1 out of 5 U.S. passengers bring prohibited items into the airplane, find a survey
The survey among flight passengers found that more than 20 percent intentionally or unintentionally threw illegal items at checkpoints of the U.S. Transportation Security Administration, including at least 6 percent who betrayed the plane while carrying illegal guns or other weapons.
The more than 1 percent claimed they had mistakenly discovered that they were irresponsible with guns, ammunition or explosives.
The survey at more than 1,000 people - conducted by a Jet Charter Service, the Stratos Jet Charters Inc. - also found that younger travellers were more likely to violate the rules.
The respondents who said they were able to fly knowingly with something that was banned by the TSA were 19,7 percent Millennials, compared to less than 15 percent who were members of the Generation X.
The most common items that were dropped at TSA agents abroad were food and liquids.
The more than 34% admitted knowingly carrying weapons with knives through security, while 2,24% of the female respondents and 34% of the male respondents also confirmed that they carried abroad illegal drugs in the plane.
The company said it had asked travellers across the country to find out how many had brought illegal cargo through the airport security system and how many had done it abroad.
I'm not surprised that the people who carry the most slipware - knowingly or unknownly - through security were those who were most likely to fly.
The company weighs in that the TSA regulations are somewhat complicated and confusing.
The people are often uncertain what liquids they are allowed to take with them or how much of them.
I’m also not surprised that the largest number of the TSA’s possessions are prohibited drugs.
I remember a long time ago people dared to think that TSA could see books as discarded discardware.
Immigration is allowed on inbound flights, but not on international flights.
I'm sorry, it's okay: Thousands of Tesla customers stormed orders
If you're a Tesla fan, you'll want to keep up with the huge number of pre-orders for its new Tesla "Model 3".
I have previously underlined that a portion of the customers have cancelled their free reservation already.
The always triumphant figures to revenue growth and yet gigantic sales targets have revealed Tesla’s latest quarterly earnings report has revealed a different, less glancing number: the number of cancellations at the new mass market model.
I had been inundated in the past few months with the more than 500.000 pre-orders for the new car, whose rollout is just beginning.
I agree with Musk: Of the total 51,500 pre-orders, 6,500 have already been cancelled.
I had repeatedly pointed out that it was merely reservations.
If you cancel a reservation, Tesla will refund the $1000 (in the US $1000 and in Britain $1000) "reservation fee" fully.
I estimated that there would be 455,000 such preliminary reservations, Musk said in a phone call with analysts.
The cancellation of previously around 12 percent of all orders could become a problem, the Tesla CEO believes.
The argument: The challenge with the ambitious growth targets is not in supply, but on the production side.
The last year, Tesla delivered 84,000 vehicles.
I hope it will be - all models together - 500.000, 2020 a million.
The demand for it is obvious.
In Musk's case, currently there are 1800 reservations to be made.
I just ordered a "Model 3" today, I can expect early in the second quarter of 2018 with the release - if Tesla manages to test its naked, yet never tested production roads without any major undertakings with maximum availability.
The experts doubt that this is possible.
I don't think it's going to cause any major disruptions, then the uncertainty of reservations could become a problem for Tesla.
If then the company can’t prevent unhappy customers from running into chains.
IEPA chairman Pruitt pulls himself from the hiatus in the rules of the Obama-era to reduce greenhouse gas emissions
The day after he was dismissed by 15 states, Scott Pruitt, the chief executive of the Environmental Protection Agency, took his earlier decision to delay the implementation of the rules of the Obama administration to reduce the emission of smoke-related air pollution.
Iitt presented the change when his agency responded to the needs of state environmental agencies more responsive than previous administrations.
I did not mention the suit which had been filed against his previous position in a federal court.
I’m talking about a deadline that expired on October 1 for states to comply with the standards of 2015 for bodily ozone.
The governor announced in June that he would extend the amendment to a year to give his administration more time to study the plan and to avoid "sitting into local decisions or hindering economic growth".
Iitt, who before his appointment by President Donald Trump was Chief Justice of Oklahoma City, was long been a reliable supporter of stricter environmental regulations.
Ignoring his arrival in Washington, Pruitt has repeatedly tried to block regulation or delay regulation that threatens the chemical industry and the industries of fossil fuels.
The sudden change from Tuesday is the latest legal backlash for the Pruitts regulatory rollback.
The U.S. Supreme Court has ruled that the EPA has exceeded its authority when it attempted to implement a rule of the Obama administration that requires oil companies to monitor and limit methane gas emissions.
In a Tuesday’s statement, Pruitt suggested that his knee-jerk move at Ozone standards could justify the willingness of the U.S. government to cooperate with the states through the complex process of timely fulfilling the new standards.
"Unlike previous administrations, the EPA has often failed to meet the deadlines for execution and then waited for activist groups and others to intervene, and in a meeting to determine the date for execution," Pruitt said.
I don't believe in regulation by courts, and we take deadlines seriously.
"We also take the law and authority that it gives us seriously."
I agree with the statement of the EPA that Pruitt will eventually use its "right to delay and all other legal remedies" to ensure that the regulations "are based on a solid policy and the best available information."
The Republicans in Congress are calling for a comprehensive revision of the Occupy Wall Street Act.
In the last month, Congress approved a bill designed to slow down the implementation of the rules from 2015 to at least eight years.
The measure has not been approved in the Senate yet.
In New York, General Judge Eric Schneiderman, who led the coalition of states that had challenged the EPA in this week’s ruling, said the group beefs up the legal pressure on the U.S. government.
"The removal of the EPA - after our suits - is a major win for the health and safety of these 7,500 New Yorkers and the over 115 million Americans who are directly affected by the smoke that flows into their communities," Schneiderman said.
The Yorkshire counties included in this case California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Minnesota, New Hampshire, Maine, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Virginia and Washington and the District of Columbia.
I-Ozone is created when chemicals from cars, power plants, oil refineries, chemical plants and other sources in the atmosphere react to sunlight.
The resulting smog can cause vulnerable groups of people serious ailments, and each year contribute to hundreds of pre-existing deaths.
The public health and the environmentalists jumbled over Pruitt’s unexpected course of action.
"It is disconcerting how much pressure it takes to get this reasonable step taken by the responsible for protecting the air we aspire to," said Lori Ann Burd from the Center for Biological Diversity.
"We must continue to fight the ideological crossroads of the Trump administration to respond to environmental concerns and their special interests".
Inlingen feiert 750-jähriges Jubiläum der St. Hilda-Kirche
The 75th anniversary of St. Hilary's Basilica: At the occasion of the 75th anniversary of St. Hilary's Basilica, on the old cemetery grounds in Tumlingen, on Sunday, July 16th, there will be a Serenade.
Its idyllic setting and nice views of the town make the Historic St Hilary Square a popular place to visit.
The visitors of the sixth Benefit Symposium can be inspired by this kraftful place.
The restoration and preservation of the old building in the town have attracted the friends and supporters of Tumlingens to their cause.
The Martini says: "It's a unique dwelling".
"In 1267, the St. Hilary Chapel was first mentioned in the Württembergic census: Graf Hermann von Sulz sold "the hill with the surrounding church to Tumlingen along with the vows" to Magister Earl of Horst, who had been in charge of the church.
The wording of the pamphlet stated that on the Tumling Hill besides the apostle’s chapel was also a heritage site to which the church or the patronage had been assigned and not omitted.
I also saw people living there.
The description of the Mayor's Freudenstadt of 1858 indicates that along with the underground and the upper town, which are still to be seen in the town of Tumlingen just now, was the "Berg" the third, the heritage Siege of the
The maps from the year 1600 underline these geographical features.
The patronage law originated from the early medieval property rights.
The Lord who built a church, equipped it with a priest, remained faithful to this church and could repay this property.
It was associated with the right to nominate a priest or recommend the priest to nominate a new priest.
The old church was in the churchyard and two bells were on the turret.
The largest of the two burnt at Christmas 1673.
The newly erected Gloves were first issued in 1692, but had to be withdrawn later in the Second World War in 1942.
It was during the 30-year war (1616-1648) that the windows were assaulted and the bells were broken.
The roof was undone.
This year, French troops were stationed in the vicinity of the church.
I burnt down the cannon and church stoves and used them as fuel.
The ruins of the church drove 1809 to collapse.
The 1860s the Tumling Hilary Field also served as the final resting place for the dead from Hörsfeld.
The church was expanded and the Hilary Chapel was abandoned.
The church was left standing.
The New Year's Eve, 1834, a sword struck the church and the half struck a hole.
Ignoring a glitch, the turret was abated.
The now preserved turret remained as evidence of the 750-year-old church history.
I owe Horst Kallenberger and Robert Wasem of the "School Renters" as the replacement of Dieter Dockhorn the Hilary-Annex.
I invite the friends and supporters of Tumlingens to attend the sixth Serenade on the old graveyard to St. Hilary's Chapel.
The song is performed by the Combo of the Kepler High School Freudenstadt and with lyrics by Kurt Kübler and Reinhold Matteis.
Its leader Hartmut Romann speaks the final words.
The program starts at noon.
I'll be at the door at 15.30pm.
In honor of the Serenade, a funeral will be held at the graveyard.
"Get a summer night under the shade of old trees and with the farthest view across hills to the forest," the organisers put out the fantastic view.
The Serenade is only held at dry weather.
The organisers hope to attract many supporters to the preservation of the historic St. Hilary Memorial, which is important to Tumlingen and Hörsfeld.
The friends and supporters of Tumlingen feel the community is especially important to them, as Serenade organiser Walter Martini says.
I want to check approval of wind turbines
The "Boishead Writer" doesn't see any legal requirement for the construction and has been referred to the Land Council.
The association "Boise Whistleblower" has asked Landlord Andreas Coenen (CDU) to renew its approval for the construction of proposed wind turbines in the Boise Nettle.
In order to be left-handed.
The association argued that at the time of approval on December 31, 2016, in the Boissalière Nette hadn’t even been installed any wind turbines, since to that date in Viersen was only at the city’s northern edge a wind turbine conveyor belt
In this conurbation, construction and operation of wind turbines are generally possible, to the extent that the conurbation has but a restriction on wind turbine use for the remaining urban area.
Thelei Zones are designed to prevent a "sparing" of the landscape.
The City of Viersen had just a few days ago approved by amendment to the land use plan a second wind turbine constellation in the Boundary Nette - which hadn't been approved by the City Council of Düsseldorf, due to a form error.
"Due to the lack of planning permission, the issued permit is after all constitutional and therefore should be revoked," said Christopher Erkens, executive director of "Boishead Writer".
It’s up to you: The City Council approved before the summer session again the wind limit zone in the Boundary Nette; a permit issued by the City Council is yet to be issued.
Ikens: "As a result, at this time, the issue of a permit for the construction of wind turbines is rejected".
The circle confirms the receipt of the request.
"The correspondence has been received since last week by the county," said a spokesman.
The county takes it upon itself to investigate the matter again.
I do not anticipate that the process will be stopped.
Ignoring ongoing hearings at the administrative tribunal, the county council did not inquire into the arguments of the association "Boishead whistleblowers".
The NEW Re, a subsidiary of the NEW, is planning on a site at Boislar Nette the construction of four jet-powered wind turbines.
The company, which is owned by the City of Viersen, has entered into lease agreements with the owner of the approximately 65 acres of the property.
The addition of the four wind turbines will help cover the electricity needs of around 11,400 households - that's about one fifth of the electricity needs of all fourth-generation homes.
The NEW Re wants to invest about $20 million.
The previous summer, Viersen City Council gave green light for the purchase of three wind turbines in the Windpark Linnich at Aachen as well as a participation in a wind turbine project in Übach-Palenberg in the county of Heinsberg.
The truck and trailer collide: Woman dies at the scene of tragic accident
The tragic accident occurred on Friday morning at 10 p.m. on the bridge crossing the railway line between Northampton and Boundary Waters (Rhode Island).
The woman was fatally injured.
In addition, another person was severely injured.
It remained closed over the course of hours.
The police said a 17-year-old girl from Bornich drove with her truck in the course of the guided driving with her 53-year-old mother as a passenger the L 333 inbound to Bogel.
"Shoppers and merchants are planning "home-shopping" week-end
The Langley area and people from the region will be able to explore in September the shopping opportunities in the downtown area.
The Gewerbeverein and the City Council want to use the weekend on Sept. 8 and 9 to encourage residents to shop in the downtown area.
In the words of the businessman, Christian King, the "Heavenly Shopping Week" will encourage customers to consider what offers the local market offers abroad.
The plan is to create a market with regional providers, similar to the weekly market.
It will showcase local companies with their training programs.
In addition, the shops of the downtown area will be invited to "Micro-Shopping".
The campaign does not target residents of the city and the nearby region.
The preparations included promotional spots in the radio, an Internet video and beaded beads that point to the campaign’s theme, according to Christian King.
The Municipality and Chamber of Commerce are working together with the Industries Association.
I'm going to take the Gewerbeverein and the City in a further step of the project "Attractive City".
This includes new offerings such as the first "activity day" to the Brunch along with ice skating on Sunday, conversations with all business owners and Wires to encourage them to participate.
The attractive offerings on Saturday and the elimination of parking fees at this time are part of the plan.
The client’s needs will be re-established or re-established.
In addition to Kurgäste and Tourists.
If even many locals had lost sight of the city when shopping, they would have lost sight of it.
The end-residents would all have to contribute to the city's revitalization - from renters, the businesses of the whole city and clubs.
I gel with a network to overcome the lethargy that has been partly rooted out, had King said in spring.
The St. Louis, Leiter of the Immigration Center in McKinley, said that to participate in the nation's third "Home Shopping Day," will be five Twenty-sixth-century cities.
In Bad Langensalza sind dies Weimar, Söhnedorf, Heiligenstadt und Blechenburg.
"To promote the value of local trade and its relevance to the welfare of our cities," said Streich.
The campaign undertaken by IHK and with many partners makes it clear that every citizen could be influenced with their purchases by their direct environment.
Ignition explosion and multiple injuries after explosion at US high school
The construction of the school building was interrupted by a gas explosion in the school building.
A number of other people were injured.
In a gas explosion in the US city of Minneapolis, two people have died and neighbours have been injured, some of them severely.
It was reported that the fire was still in critical condition.
The human survived when a part of a school building collapsed at the explosion.
The initial victim was later also found dead.
The toddler was an employee of the school.
In the unsolved case, the authorities suspected working on a gas pipeline.
It was during the holidays that only few people remained in the building of the Minneapolis Academy.
I put after bypassing translators of phone calls Mexico under pressure for payment of the border wall
The transcripts of phone calls between US President Donald Trump and leaders of Mexico and Australia have been released by the Washington Post.
The 27. January Trump called in a phone call with Mexico’s president, Enrique Pena Nieto, to stop communicating publicly that he would not pay for a proposed border wall.
The US president blamed him for angering the Mausoleum publicly. Reports suggested he said to him: "That you can't tell the press."
The president started his campaign with the promise to build at the southern border of the United States a wall, and threatened Mexico to pay for the project.
The transcript of his first meeting with the Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull was also released and endorsed a diplomatic exchange.
I told Mr Turnbull that a trade deal for the United States to take immigrants coming to Australia was "lazy", "misleading" and "dumb" and that the best practice on the trade offered by the government was to treat him like a "bad guy".
"Trump ended the call after he told Mr Turnbull, "this is the most embarrassing call for the whole day."
Is Ford Massacre: Activists carry reign of terror as a rally for peace again
I drove a 1948 Ford Mercury through a crowd of viewers in the suburb of Monroe, Georgia, and rumbled onto the Ford's block of Moore.
The car, which had four black passengers and a white driver, was able to cross the bridge, attracted a group of white men with guns to block its way.
The leader of the mob - a man mid-century dressed in a navy blue jacket - took a long train at his jacket and looked carefully through the windshield.
I watched the occupants clench their teeth in fury.
"We want this n ---- r Roger!" cried the man.
"Hold him out of the car!"
It broke the silence when a young black man was pulled from the driver's seat.
It's fortunately this scary scene that was played on July 22nd is just a follow-up.
If then a bullet is thrown around the head of "Roger", almost everyone in the audience threw up very real seats.
In 2005, citizens come to Moore's Ford Bridge to witness the night after the two black couples - Roger and Dorothy Malcom as well as George and Mae Murray Dorsey - were murdered by the Ku Klux Klan in 1946.
I have never been charged with murder.
"It's really unfortunate that in all these years, no one has been arrested - though we see them in our communities, though we know who they are," said Tyrone Brooks, who helps with the organisation of the aftermath.
"It is a curse on a story, but it is a burden for our souls."
Thes is a 71-year-old former Congressman of Georgia and a lifelong citizen.
It serves as a dramatic wake-up call to action and is a annual reminder to the Monroe community that an unfair act has never been corrected.
"We want justice, we want the pardon, we want healing, we want reconciliation, but first we must get justice," he said.
"We can't reach healing and reconciliation until we get justice."
The court-appointed coroner puts a bedside table over the body of one of the victims of the Moore-Ford lymphoma on July 27, 1946.
The FBI documents obtained by the NBC News have revealed that more than 50 men from Monroe and the surrounding Grafton area have been arrested in the Lynch case.
“No one has ever been arrested.”
The suspects have been on the run for decades, say citizens who say the double motivation for the Lynch actions in the whole city has always been known: politics and sex.
In April 1946, a decision of the Supreme Court allowed black voters in Georgia to vote for the first time at the precinct election in the summer.
In the same week as the election, according to the FBI, the black farmer Roger Malcom killed a white property owner, Barnett Hester, during a fight - apparently because of a woman.
Thes said the rumor in the city was that Hester had slept with Malcom's wife Dorothy and that the baby she wore wasn't from her husband.
The 25th of July 1946, Loy Harrison, a prominent white landlord, paid 600 dollars to bail Malcom out of jail, according to the FBI.
I was escorted by Dorothy and her co-workers Mae Murray and George Dorsey to prison.
It was then that they moved away from the prison and approached the Moore's Ford Bridge, crossing a Lynchmob's carriage.
"As it turns out, it was Harrison who prepared the murders and ordered them," concludes hereafter a FBI report.
"It is also evident that there was a co-operation between the state and local criminal justice system, which was not only involved in the murders, evidence was disclosed and the identity of witnesses was false".
Its formulation is even more concise.
"It was a voting rights murder," he said.
"You were all killed to send a message to black people in this community: "If you sign up and if you vote, then you will happen to happen this here."
This past year, Cassandra Greene led the annual aftermath of Moore Ford Bridge Lynch's murder.
The representation is atmospheric, emotional and is rooted in a kind of deep-rooted racism, of which many believe that he no longer exists in America.
I’m hard to watch, and still difficult to look away, but Greene said that’s the point.
"We don't want to talk about the Lynch because we then become confronted with its presence in us all," she said.
"Anyway I can't build a relationship with you if you don't want to listen or don't want to hear what I've been through".
The casting for the upcoming production began in June, and on the first day almost 30 actors - a dude White and the rest Black - drowned into a room and laid out as Greene gave a good rundown of the piece.
Ide Marbaugh is here Green's co-star.
I have been playing the role of the chief clan member for years, but he said the role will never be easy.
"I feel sorry for myself because I'm not that way," Marbaugh said.
"Anyway, I think it is very important to keep this story alive because we don't want to return to these times."
The other side of the room, the actors Darrius Bradshaw and Nick Rascona, who play Roger Malcom and Barnett Hester, were trying to do their verses.
The piece starts with Malcom, who calls Hester and threatens him, whispering that he has slept with his wife Dorothy.
"I said, n --- he, disappear from my property!"
Icona erects the fire.
I'm going to take a break.
I then bounce everyone (including all black actors) into glory.
I'm laughing at the most.
"What?!", cried Rascona.
I'm alarmed and confused.
I'm too thick?
"No," said Greene, still kissing.
"I just don't think white people were saying 'n --- he'."
"Dad," laughed one of the other black characters.
"You just have to meet the hardest 'R.'."
This is where the energy is lost in the room, a feeling of cameramanship replaces the uncertainty.
I am trying to make this right, not only because of the game, but also because of the memory of the four dead people.
The scene begins again.
The next time Rascona says the N-word, he says it sharply and with afterthought.
I don't care who laughs.
The replay ends violently and quickly.
I've heard crying, shaking and then silence.
The woman, dressed in a funeral costume, stands over the grave of the actor and leads Bill Holiday's funeral lob "Strange Fruit".
The voice bounces at every second word.
The hundreds of feet away wisps a group of about four dozen viewers sweat and tears from their eyes.
The audience is almost identical between Black and White.
The couple is coming from Ithaca, New York, to see the performance, many just walk up the street.
I have all spent at least eight hours experiencing Georgia's stubborn fever when Brooks takes her on a pilgrimage to the graveyards of the Malcoms and Dorseys.
I to this point, the murders have been an anecdote, but now, when you’re on the same continent where the Lynchburg murders took place, the air feels gesperct.
If the last note of the song is out, Greene invites the crowd to come closer and inhale the Leisure Name.
I hover over their heads, record the fake blood and the still body and sing to each other.
"You're not really dead," murmurs a little boy as he remembers.
The next few minutes Greene dangles the crowd - and suddenly it's over.
The actress throws up the Lynch seat and wipes away her tears.
Ishaw hugs Marbaugh, the man in uniform who played the clan member.
The Rascona hugs two of his co-stars and bounces then into their arms weeping, the emotional burden of the performance blasting through at once.
"It's okay," flounces one of the women.
I know that doesn't lie in your heart.
"You did that out of a reason."
The audience sits down with the actors for dinner.
In a table conversation, a white couple from Atlanta is angry about the aftermath with a black couple they just met.
Ie Duplinski struggled to find words to describe what emotion the performance left behind.
"It is hard to hear these scary words and actions... from people who look like you yourself and who do because they look like you," she said.
"What that really does with me makes me believe that Lynch is still going to continue," she added, "now that's just police schizophrenia."
The same room holds Tyrone Brooks's table at his table, he is eating and reminding us of the citizenship rights.
I said he has already started planning the performance in the next year.
"The aftermath is in some way inspiring, because it reflects the sadness of what we have endured, but it is also a moment of learning," he said.
I'm sorry, if we learn nothing from it, then it can happen again.
"Who does not study his own history is guilty of repeating it."
"Glory of the Gods" versified the Wagnerians in Bayreuth
It's the fifth part of Richard Wagner's monumental opera. Director Frank Castorf puts on a spectacular incarnation before gigantic, six-story castle.
The screen (designed by Aleksandar Denic) shows cluttered streets including Mausoleum and McDonald's in New York City, a "Push and Elbow" sign from DDR or the New York Stock Exchange.
If you want to park an open-top Mercedes-Benz, you can see the Rheintöchter posing as rock stars, or alternatively, you can park an Isetta.
Iapt oil paintings remind me of Castor's Leitmotiv - money, power and glory - that runs through his "Ring" incarnation.
The three Rheintöchter - sung by Stephanie Houtzeel, Wiebke Lehmkuhl and Alexandra Steiner - harmonize like never before in the "Rheinold" wonderfully.
This time, they kidnap Siegfried (Steve Vincent), burnt in Hollywood-style a body in the carriage and give up the Krawallo Clock.
The Milling sings the herald of the Haggis, the aura of a heavyweight boxer.
Ial the scene when he kills Siegfried.
I still have to believe Gunther (Mark Earnhardt) in it.
The audience danced to the ensemble with fierce applause.
It's been celebrated by Foster, Milling, Vink and pianist Janowski, who has been beschended and the hands to Merkel's speech for forty years.
I'm sorry for the Festive Orchestra, which appears first on the stage - at the height of the big heat again in leger style.
I was expecting the performance of Frank Castorf and his cast.
If he hadn't had a glittering Punkband concert over the course of 2013, there was five years later big jubilee, in which the rhythmic "Buh-huh-huh-huh-huh-huh-huh-huh-huh
The play-by-play director, Katharine Wagner, may have been pleased.
"Many years ago, the audience has been associated with the "Ring" in some way," she had said shortly before the performance of the dpa.
The audience has not only made a form of peace with Castorf, but it has grown a respect for his viewpoint.
I see a positive resonance.
The Menge works as a volunteer
The volunteers work in their volunteer year equally at multiple locations.
I'm anywhere? Where are you?
I: Normally shop in Steinfurth in the furniture section, once a week I help here in Greville in the furniture booth.
I have also been involved in the open-minded Ganzer program at the school.
“What are your experiences with this?”
I: It's a nice, broad spectrum that I see here.
I have worked with different people, with teenagers, with migrants, with young people.
I am now 26 years old, so a late retiree.
I'm confused. Where does this come from?
I: I have done a lot of math.
I then finished a building engineering degree, say, successfully.
I have forgiven it for me to be the falsehood and I want to do something different, work with people.
I then asked you what do you do.
It’s a social year, there’s a glimpse, you can see how it’s going to be before you, in the Brenner maybe, really.
“Why was it so?” he asked.
I: I have collected great memories.
I will start my bachelor's degree in social work.
I will be dual-semester, doing probably in Juvenile Court Herne a Social Worker’s job and studying in Hampshire at the University of Hampshire.
I don't think it's something unusual to have during the volunteer service to have multiple different locations?
I: Yes, it is very variable.
I guess it depends on where you make your FSJ.
I can do it from homelessness to youth work - in all facets of social work.
I thought it was very amusing.
I was also part of the OGS, so in the afternoons.
I thought that was exactly what attracted me.
I was able to identify my own strengths and see how it really goes.
The same as in Architecture?
I: Well, here’s not going to be about calculating gravity.
I've always had other people around my head that each have a different story behind them.
It doesn't matter if a FGM is a teenager who has been out of the family - you have to always look individually at it.
I think it's interesting.
I hadn't had any contact with you?
I: Forgive me, I’m not the type.
I think it's a area that gives one a lot.
The love, much friendliness.
I also have negative moments, but so is life.
Iarson cut another 3,000 jobs and reduced the dividend to restore the business
The British education group Pearson said Friday it will cut another 3,000 jobs and cut its share of the company by 72 percent as a new restructuring program is being launched to overcome the pressure with which the company has been faced.
The hiring, which General Manager John Fallon announced over the course of 2018 and 2019, comes additionally to his previous reorganization, at which already lost 4,000 jobs.
Iarson announced in a third cost-benefit program a plan to cut costs by another 300 million pounds (398 million US dollars) to revive a business that has been damaged by the rapid move to digital learning.
The company, which had recently sold its stake in Penguin Random House to the partner Bertelsmann, said that its forecast for the year has remained unchanged after it had in the first quarter posted a growth of 1 percent to 2,05 billion pounds.
Infantry attack of Kabul: Nato-Soldier killed at self-defense
The suicide bomber has attacked a military convoy in Afghanistan, killing a soldier of the Nato and injuring several others, say officials.
The Soldiers and a Dolphin were injured, according to a statement from the Nato.
It is believed that at the scene in the village of Qaraqosh also died three civilians.
The bomb blast is the latest violence that has hit Afghanistan this month - on Tuesday, more than 30 people were killed in a mosque in Herat.
The Pakistani suicide bomber killed two people in the vicinity of the Islamic State of Iraq's ambassador in Kabul on Monday.
"In a statement from the Nato, the explosion occurred on Thursday night as a joint patrol with the Afghan army was attacked by a "from persons wearing impromptu weapons fired explosives".
The statement states that all the victims are in a stable condition and are being treated at the US Air Force base on Bagram.
It is believed that the growing strength of the Taliban and the group known as “Islamic State” in Latakia is a major concern for the NATO troops in the nearby Bagdad.
It is estimated that in Afghanistan, in the first half of 2017, there were at least 1.685 civilians killed, of which about 20 percent in the capital.
In July, a suicide bomber killed at least 30 people in a predominantly schizophrenic district of Kabul.
The Taliban said they had carried out this attack.
This past May, a bomb blast in the center of the city killed more than 150 people with the deadliest militant attack of the country since the U.S. forces captured the Taliban from power.
The violence underscores the fragile security situation in Afghanistan as U.S. President Donald Trump is considering raising the number of U.S. troops that support military and police in the country.
It is believed that the suicide bombings in Kabul in recent weeks also caused a crisis of public confidence in the government, its policies and especially in the reputation of President Shavkat Mirziyoyev.
IEPA kneels decision on the suspension of the Smog Regulation after complaints about
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has suspended a decision to regulate the government of Obama, which requires the states to limit the smog-related emissions. This was a day after 15 states suspended the agency because of its failure to comply with regulations.
The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) announced late Tuesday the decision to implement the so-called "Oil Regulations 2015", and said it represented the obligation of the agency to cooperate with states.
"We believe in the dialogue with and believe that we can respond to our state partners," EPA spokesman Scott Pruitt said in a statement.
Iitt had announced in June the intention of the EPA to review the Ozone regulations - in which in one part of the country chemical emissions are measured to determine where adjustments need to be made to meet stricter air quality standards - in order to
The group of 15 mostly democratic states, together with the District of Colombia, filed suit and said the protest was illegal.
The government of President Donald Trump has tried to reverse a broad range of environmental obligations that the former president Barack Obama onerated as part of a broader agenda, which is aimed at boosting economic growth.
The efforts have however led to the retreat of Democratic and environmental groups, who are concerned about the impacts of greater emissions on public health.
The website of the EPA says that the inhalation of air that contains ozone can reduce "the lung function and increase the respiratory symptoms" such as asthma.
I want to create community space
In the end, the decision was clear: At two votes, the Council of Fulton-Windmore approved the establishment of a community room in the proposed senior living facility.
In the discussion, there is one important information: The purchase contract for the still missing property has been signed, reports Mayor Bernhard Tjaden.
This will still take place until the previously the church’s property is in the municipality’s possession, but now there is no planning restriction on the by a private investor to be built project.
This is a discussion about a community space.
The two investors who are still in the boat have offered to help the community.
In the basement, he would have a living area - around 55 square feet - and an adjacent patio with immersive views for a special price.
The administration and the majority of the community agree that such a community space should not be seen as a meeting place only for the residents of the senior living community, but openly invited into the community.
The example made the word of the "squirrel's cabin" the talk of the town.
The decision, which was due to the availability of funds for the 2017-18 fiscal year, was passed earlier this year through fundraising opportunities.
The building is located in the rehabilitation area.
The establishment of a community space would be, according to Tjaden, with 60 percent of 30 percent subsidised.
I see the decision being made to signal investors that you don't want him in this regard to have a knee between his legs, the conclusion being that both Sattel- - which is related to the surrounding area - as well as Pulsar - have to be built.
The unnecessary, so does not only Wilfred Sohmer, is this addendum.
I'll help you out: One by one he happens to be the Greetings Committee.
The same goes for the community room.
Ia Ruf refers to the many own buildings with which you don't get as far as you can, for you are now leaning toward the community room from the window, she says: "I'm doing hard."
I'm sure Staiger is talking about the community space - though absolutely against a municipal participation.
I see dahing a verde subscription to without a doubt wealthy or even out-of-the-money investors.
In fact, with the purchase of the land, you don’t get any compensation, but get a genuine, immeasurable compensation, according to the counterargument.
The petition asking for the resolution to be amended accordingly finds three supporting votes.
I remain with two opposing votes to the original program, which Steve Haller sums up as follows: "If we put the bill so, we make a giant step there to close a gap in our infrastructure".
The collision with car: Radar crashes on road
It is reported that an 82-year-old man was hit Tuesday in Garath by a car and severely injured.
The 82-year-old Langley was riding his bicycle at 12.20 p.m. on the roadway of the street Blackway from Hildesheim.
The senior wanted to cross the road in front of the Avenue Am Buchanan Bunker.
In the same direction, a truck driver gave him precedence.
I noticed the Longfield driver was on the road, but apparently didn’t notice the traffic.
The car collided with a BMW that was driven by a 66-year-old Hildebrandt.
The man was thrown onto the street.
I suffered severe injuries and was taken to a nearby hospital with a respiratory tract infection.
I have to miss the Superbowl game against Borussia Dortmund on David Alaba and Thiago
The Super Bowl doesn't happen without him: David Alby has to skip the game against Liverpool.
I Personally, I'm going to see the Yankees for the first time in the new season.
Ignore the title defense in the Super Bowl against the Podium.
The personnel concerns surrounding the U.S. soccer champions are getting bigger before the Super Bowl on Saturday (20.30 p.m./ABC and Eurosport) at home to pound-for-pound Liverpool are getting bigger.
If Carlo Ancelotti has to miss the duel with the Blues, he will also have to leave David Albarra.
It was confirmed by the Italians on Friday.
I missed the Mariners, James, Thibaut Courtney, Jerome Boateng, Arjen Robben and Juan Bernadette.
The five losses in the past six Test matches have caused Ancelotti to blame the physical condition and lack of balance in the game of his team.
"We know we're not in the best physical state," said Ancelotti and added: "The most important thing is balance in the team.
"It was last night's not good."
The 58-year-old believes in a performance improvement in the first official playoff game of the season.
The football is also tactics, strategy, personality and motivation.
I have great confidence that my team shows these qualities.
The team is ready to go.
"We want to play intelligently," said Ancelotti, who expects a "strong, intense game."
The duel between the two American football teams draws the fans in their banter.
The game is home to 81.360 fans, according to the Dallas Cowboys.
The Harvest from star to star wanders
In Harrogate will be the nation's first "Street Path".
I'm planning to join the Club of Astronomy of St. Andrews.
The Planetary Path is in Göttingen - since 2003.
The "Street Path" will meet the informational needs of many Harbor visitors, he said.
I associate nature, science, movement and sports performance.
The members want to set up along the proposed route taverns and provide information on stars and stars.
In a pilot phase to 2018, the association is planning "good-quality installations at five to six locations" in the upper Midwest.
In the valley of St. Andreasberg, Braunlage, Hobart and Sievers.
The information on the tables should be updated via the Internet.
The location factor plays a part in a good mobile signal reception.
The barrier to entry was a consideration.
I'm hoping the Sternen Path will be expanded to include trains.
"On the starwalk, the viewers will learn much about the Physics of each star," the association said.
The students learned why stars would have different colors or why a star would be brighter than another, although it was significantly further away.
It will also be determined in which direction a selected star belongs and when it is best to be seen.
The association has been operating since 2014 in the mountain town of St. Andrews, the highest point in North Carolina.
The location is right in the National Park Harbor, which according to the National Park Service is one of the six darkest regions in the United States.
You can see from there the Milky Way and even the Andromeda Galaxies with just a glance.
The Unitarian Universalist Church has been established on behalf of the Friends of the Planetarium Göttingen something similar to the proposed starwalk - the Planetary Walk.
In front of Gebhard's hotel in the Goethe-Institut, which forms the innermost part of our solar system, the planet's path with its shafts leads up to the Hainberg and to the Sternwarte - as well as a "awesome" location in Die
The snippets with the individual planets - including the to the dwarf planet depicted Pluto at the end - are exact in orbit and measured from one to two billion.
It shrinks so on a cube of 6,5 millimeters, while the exact 75 meters away moon measures 70 millimeters.
The entire distance of the Planetary Path is well four miles.
The light from the sun to Pluto takes about eight hours, so walkers will need a good hour to get to the summit with Pluto.
It’s also faster than the light in the universe.
The marsh to the next fixed date but would still take a half year.
They Garcia and Vasily Lomachenko meet for the first time, discussing a possible showdown
Iyl Lomachenko and Mikey Garcia, who were in a collision course to insure the most exciting boxing match in navy under 147 pounds, met for the first time on Thursday.
I was in separate rooms in ESPN's Los Angeles, until Garcia, the unbeaten World Boxing Council Left-hander, ran up the stairs to Lomachenko, the World Boxing Organization Super-Champion, to watch him fight.
The Garcia victory by a 3-2 victory over the former fourth-rounder Adrien Broner on Saturday on showtime will make both fighters members of the top-five pound for pound list.
I stretched out the right hand and said: "How are you, Champion?
"Good luck," he said. "I wish you well."
Imachenko defends his belt against Miguel Marriaga on Saturday night at 19 p.m. on ESPN.
The couple posed for photos, noting Lomachenko's manager Egis Klimas that a possible showdown between the fighters would be the "perfect size."
"I am a former Federer," recalled Garcia.
I've been for Bronze [on 140 pounds], but I'm not that big.
I'm small for 140.
I want to be on lean.
I have to move on Leaner [135 pounds] and then we fight.
The demands of the fans.
"Let us give them that."
The makingko agreed to it.
"Boxing needs this fight."
Thes asked if it should be on pay-per-view, part of a strategy that Lomachenko has to fight for a 135-pound defeat in this year’s draft to make it happen in the next summer with Garcia a date (37-0, 30 knockouts) that would
"The fight could happen in Pay-Per-View mode because all fans have asked for it," Garcia said and spoke later offended at the network that offers the best financial package.
I'm the best of the best.
The other names can create this kind of attention.
" Whenever they are ready... "
It said, he considers Lomachenko a "enormous fighter," and he may be able to participate in his Saturday's fight.
"Lomachenko kept his generous loving eye on Garcia and said that he thinks the three-time champion from Riverside"seems to be slowing down, tut Mikey... you wanted that Ko-Out".
I said the focus was to show Schlaging, then boxing.
I said they could feel the momentum that was building for the own battle.
This is the battle that has to be carried out.
I don’t think any other battle can create such much attention and interest.
"I am more than happy to work on it," said Garcia.
Imachenko said: "I've been waiting for the top kicker, and that's Mikey.
"It will be a tonic battle."
I'm sorry to hear about the injuries suffered by Reiter
The collision on the A7 killed at least four people to the extent of serious injuries.
The first driver of an Opel Zafira lost control of his vehicle at about 16.30 p.m. near the intersection Market Street probably after a rear-view mirror failed.
The truck rolled down to left in the bouldering, where it was overturned and then sat on the roof in the green.
The four occupants - two adults and two children - were severely injured at the scene.
In the initial recovery of the victims by the ambulance, the A7 was shut down for about an hour, subsequently the traffic on the right road at the accident site could be redirected.
Is Hoffmann: "Didn't work out better"
The Hoffmann hopes that the improvement in the offensive lineup in Auburn will bring home points.
It was Andre Hoffmann’s first season, with the result also, if there weren’t the two goals at the halftime break against Baltimore.
"That was two goals too much, and we need to play in Aue even better," says the defender of Fiorentina.
The Erie Canal will also be improved further.
It's a goal after a free kick that the Fortunes don't want to be a part of.
"For the future it will be that no one will be placed next to Michael (Rensing) on the line."
It is believed that his team will also be able to adapt to the experience in practice with the three-pointer better than with the four-pointer.
"Nobody knows how we're going to play in Aue," says his coach Friedman Funkel, yet Hoffmann is confident of his chances, "because we're just in the three-game stretch on the half-time lineup in Kaan Ayhan and Niko Gi
"The prerequisite is, but, that we can harmonize better and we don't need to do so many apologies."
It also takes Hoffman to Auburn to win the game.
I suppose you can speak but after an unsuccessful start of a failed start, I don't know.
"That performance might be okay," Hoffmann said.
"If we can come away with four points and focus on the playoffs, we will certainly be able to speak of a solid season."
“Of course,” said his trainer. “I didn’t want to know.”
"The start of the season is only after six to eight games," said Friedman Funkel, who doesn't want to speak of a advantage against Auburn just because the game of the Eagles in Heidenheim had to be cancelled due to an unfortunate incident.
"Now they can start the season almost with a home game," Funkel said and Hoffman believes that the players from Auburn might be even more fresh as they wouldn't have had a hard and complete game like Fortuna against a playoff contender in the Knock.
"Anyway they don't know as 100-percent where they are currently," says the defensive coordinator of the Jaguars.
It was expected that the Eagles will go out as a light favorite on Sunday in the match in the finally (finally) completed stadium of Aue.
"That we throw them away just because we have the potential to get under the first seat is bullshit," says Funkel, whose tally at just one loss against Auburn out of nine is certainly positive.
"There is no team in the 2. Bundesliga that you have to beat from the start," says Fortuna's head coach.
"Any such statement to make would be arrogant and overreaching".
The sophomore will not be able to see his players on Sunday on a regular basis.
The results of the Swedish Asthma test have been released
The latest results of tests for asylum seekers in Sweden using a new method of medical assessment of their age suggest that more than 80 percent of the tested people are older than 18 years. But not everyone believes in the accuracy of the accurate data.
The Swedish Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (RCDCD) began carrying out the tests last year.
This will help during the asylum process the assessment of age more accurately, after the Swedish Migration Agency (MSA) was criticized for making mistakes in determining the correct age of some asylum seekers who were minors.
This morning Migrationsverket sent 6.880 to test cases and the Forensic Medicine Agency has now released the results of the total of 2.844 tests from mid-March to July 2017.
The majority (2002) were judged to be 18 or older, while in another 25 cases the Forensic Medicine Agency determined that the person was "probably 18 or older."
The 432 cases was the conclusion that the person was "probably under the age of 18".
The tests are performed only in cases where the age of the person is in question.
In Johan Göransson of the Forensic Medicine Agency, the results have been consistent at the last few months.
"We don't see a big difference in the statistics of the past few months, the numbers are pretty consistent," he told The Local.
The high number of cases where the person was treated as over 18 means not necessarily that the asylum seeker has lied about his age.
In May, the agency published the results of 581 tests and said that there were 443 cases that suggested that the examiner was 18 years or older.
If the newspaper Svenska Dagbladet examined the 581 published results, it found that in 243 of these cases the person had offended that she was in this year’s 18th century.
The method of medical ageing, when scans of weak bones and MRI scans of bones are made, which are then examined by dentists and radiologists, has also been criticized in some areas.
The Skeptic is the Endocrinologist Claude Marcus of the Karolinska Institute, whose work includes examining the genetic history of people to see if they were earlier or later than normal through puberty.
I had reason to think about it, and I don't think the type of measurement should be used.
The biological age on this scale is very uncertain.
"If we can't be sure, we shouldn't do as if we could," he told the newspaper Metro.
Iansson of the Forensic Medicine Agency, however, defended the accuracy of the tests: "In general, you can say that the risk of a child being diagnosed as an adult is low.
"The biggest risk is when the person is younger than 18, in this case this is roughly 10 percent."
It's all in the plan
The work on the three bridges of the landmark Highway 108 between Louth and Cheshire are well under way.
It was installed a seven-foot-tall concrete bridge at the north-east corner of Lauterbach.
"We're very good in time, it's going great," says Reinhold Leicht, engineer at the department of roads and transportation in the government of Freiburg.
I started the work simultaneously on all three repaired bridges between Shrewsbury and Lauterbach.
The construction is scheduled for October and Lee is confident that the timetable will be adhered to.
The first bridge, from Scarborough, passes through the Troy.
This is a concrete bridge made of concrete that is covered with red bubblestone and has a total length of 4,800 feet.
It was built in 1900.
The two other bridges too are now in decline.
The stand-up elevator and the traffic lights will be replaced. The three buildings will now be ghost-proofed.
The two other rivers pass through the Lauterbach.
It is made of red bubblestone.
It was built in 1939 and is eleven, thirty-five, thirty-five, thirty-five, thirty-five, thirty-five, thirty-five, thirty-five
The bridge at the town of Lauterbach has now been erected on the north side of the bridge a 1,500-foot-long and seven-tonne-thick so-called bridge.
It is a Random Access Point that is also used as a business path.
The southern part of the bridge will be used on Friday to install a 2,200-foot-long bridge.
It will then be the pedestrian crossing.
In particular, it is made of plastic, a patent of the Scottish company Dizwo.
The other two bridges are already marked with the patented bridge markers.
Their hands-on expertise has required the removal of cables through the construction site in Lauterbach.
This is where there is also a fiber-optic cable that connects many companies.
The residents were informed in advance of the work by hand-letters about the project.
I had to first catch fish and sharks.
The road between the construction site and the Sacred Heart Church is a pedestrian-friendly one-way street.
In the construction of the bridge at Lake Lauterbach, the road in front of the bridge on the right-of-way between the hotels "Tannenhof" and "Sieben Linden" is completely blocked.
The cost of the three bridge repairs amounts to $700,000.
The whole thing is handled by the country.
The DAD in Gersonville: Blessed Protest at American Carnival Foods
I don’t see it so often that parties come together at a gathering, but when it comes to the Alternative for America (AfD), it comes together, which is otherwise only hard to put under one roof.
The incumbents (CDU, Democrats, Republicans, FDP, Liberals, Democrats, Independents, Independents) are part of a broad coalition that is marching at this day’s rally because the Affordable Care Act in the Gerolstein City Hall
It brings famous names to the forefront - like Alice Weidel, who forms along with Alexander Gauland the top candidate for the U.S. Congressional race on September 24, and the appointed Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.
I know those who are already hours before the start of the event want not to listen to the Affordable Care Act, but protest.
"The Easter Bunny remains bright".
The City Picnic was originally scheduled to take place under the banner "All at one table" on the Brunswick Square, but now takes place on the parking lot below the roundabout - and thus right in front of those who attended the Affordable Care Act in the City Hall
The busier picture that is offered there.
"What Christa Karoli, founder of Forum One World and one of the most generous organisers, is right: "To see how many people have come here."
"There's music and every kind of food, including a "urgent hamburger that even the AfD could eat easily," says the woman who brought him with her.
The police have dispatched many officers to Gerolstein, they show presence mostly at the train station, which is just a few blocks away from the event venue.
The Affordable Care Act is supposed to have come on Gerolstein?
The Hompees of the Affirmative Action Campaign Vulcanicum reported that he has been asked to host such a meeting and received the invitation.
The 45-year-old from Göttingen had initially come to Daun, where he received a cancellation because of the already built Laurentius Church’s lack of parking spaces.
This is also the rally, Hompes is pleased that "we can have such a nice event here".
I look at the event on the roundabout, he says: "That's the good thing of the people, mainly it stays peaceful".
It does it too: At 20 p.m. on the roundabout, a band will provide entertainment, in the city hall diverse speakers, including the rhetorical Republican U.S. Senator Uwe Young.
The saloon is filled with about 200 attendees who wait for the top candidate for the U.S. Congress, Alice Weidel, and the Republican candidate for the U.S. Senate, Barack Obama, to hold their speeches.
The police presence has been reduced, but previously the officers had a quiet night.
I spent more than an hour attending the Affordable Care Act, the guests on the front have a longer aisle, but even there it is shortly after 21 p.m. on-site.
The police can await - no special circumstances.
Iune trifft trompe-l'oeil
The rehearsal with the Wolf Creek Quartet's Frederic Belli will be in the series Haslam's Cathedral concert tomorrow, Sunday, at 20 p.m. in the church.
The Bulgarian percussionist Miroslav Petkov gives a concert under the theme "Schwarzey meets Schwarzenegger", or as he calls it "Bohemian Folklore" touches on a classical German education with roots in the jazz.
The Soldiers are winners and prize winners of numerous international competitions and have solo recitals in European top orchestras.
I am Petkovic’s soloist at the prestigious Royal Philharmonic in Amsterdam and Frederic Belli is soloist of the Symphony Orchestra of the Royal Philharmonic.
It combines the desire to transcend not only the boundaries on their instruments, but also the boundaries of the different genres.
I hear Johann Sebastian Bach at the two as in a new chorus, Daniel Schnyder's "Welcome to Bulgaria" mixes Bulgarian folk, and in the piece "Exchange Suite" of jazz-pianist Nils Wisdom, jazz and folk harmonies harmonize harmoniously.
The core of the program was first performed this spring with huge success in Freiburg.
The renowned composer Nils Wogram has written it himself for the two musicians and more importantly, the Haslaughter Cathedral with its special akustik is intentionally incorporated into the concert.
I Stewart talks about her bisexuality
A lot of people love grilled chicken and will eat it until the end of their lives.
"I want to try everything," says Kristen Stewart quite openly about her bisexuality.
"If I ever get into grilled cheese, I think: 'Oh that was cool, what comes next?'"
The most well-known relationship of the Hollywood star was that with her "Twilight" co-star Robert Pattinson, who ultimately bitterly split.
I alluded to the brunette actress's statement to the "Harper's Bazaar" magazine: "I was crushed in any serious relationship I had.
"Do you suppose I'd played it?"
Their separation gave Kristen to the fact that she was bisexual: "I have always believed in dualism and seriously believed in it.
I have also never been confused or discouraged.
"I just didn't like to be taken seriously."
The girl has suffered from depression according to "Bang Showbiz" but in high school, when she preferred to dress like a bum: "Not all girls are stereotypical girls.
It really hurt me.
I was elf when the kids told me I would look like a bum.
I felt really insulted, betrayed and humiliated.
"I look back and think: 'Mr. Smith, be proud of you!'"
The public doesn't want to know about her love life: "They expect you to behave on a certain level and that's frustrating.
"Maybe some consider me to be humble, but I don't like to be judged before the whole public."
The Governor of West Virginia knew he will leave the party
I. The Democratic Governor of West Virginia, Jim Justice, announced Thursday at a rally with President Donald Trump that he will leave the party.
"You may like it or not, the Democrats have moved away from me," Governor Justice said.
"Hear me with many prayers and much reflection... today I will tell you as a citizen of West Virginia, I cannot help you anymore if I am a democratic governor."
The demonstration broke out in joy.
"Morning I will change my registration to the Republicans," said Justice.
"As a coach, I would say it's time to play a different game."
The Trump campaign promised to make a big announcement at the West Virginia rally.
Iowa won West Virginia with 42 points, and Justice did not approve the Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton.
I, who according to Forbes is the only millionaire in the state, was elected in 2016.
It turns out that he owns coal mines in five states, and has been given by his father a coal business.
I'm guessing it's about $1.59 billion.
In the meantime, the Republican National Committee on Wednesday issued a statement, in which it said: "The party move from Governor Justice is a further blow to a Democratic party that would be more likely to hinder us than to make our country great again."
In a country with only 15 governors and the control of the few constitutional body in history, the announcement of Governor Justice is only the last amendment to a party that is from top to bottom without leadership and is not in a position to make a positive, consensus-driven
Thee loudly praises "evidence of Russia's responsibility for doping scandal
The world's leading athlete, Sebastian Coe, lobbied on Thursday for what he called an open-minded excuse from Russia to a doping scandal, but he again insisted it was not the moment for the country to return to the sport.
IAF Left-handed runner Dmitry Shylakhtin said during the IAF’s meeting at the opening ceremony of the Left-handed World Championships that the banning of his country from the sport was correct and that he was enthusiastic about the
I said it hurts me for "all the athletes who were missing at competition gold medals".
In his comments, the IAAF Congress voted for the upholding of the ban, which was lifted in November 2015, after a report from the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) found evidence of state sponsored doping in Russia.
"I thought it was a very open response, a very honest presentation," IAAF President Coe told the reporters.
"The entire committee and the entire Congress were pleased that the Russian Federation has recognized at once that it has experienced some pretty hot times and will do everything it can to ensure that the Federation is redesigned."
Ie said he was also "excited" that Russia accepted the criteria for its restoration.
"I think it was a very constructive day, and I think progress has been made, but the Congress supports the recommendations of the Task Force that this is not the moment to re-engage Russia again," Coe said.
I have to do in the next few months everything I can to normalize this situation.
"The principle was always that we wanted to separate the clean athletes from the corrosive system," he added
This year's Russian athletes will compete at the Left Coast Olympic Games, which start Friday in London, following the strict IAAF rules as neutral observers.
The head of the IAAF Task Force, Rune Anderson, said on Monday that Russia had to meet some of the criteria for a return.
Theentests are still unclear and prohibited trainers are still free to practice, he told reporters in London after a speech at the IAAF Council.
A memorial service for in Mali kidnapped soldiers
In a memorial ceremony in northern Fritzlar, around 1,000 people have been invited to remember the two at a Hubbard bomb blast in Mali.
The ceremony took place on Thursday in the temple under high security measures.
The still-unsolved bombing case said defense secretary Sarah Palin (California) had nothing to do with it.
I called the two umpteenth pilots but as "masters of their craft".
"We condemn this highest sacrifice they have made in honor of the United States," she said.
The 33-year-old Major and the 47-year-old Staunton from North Carolina were killed Tuesday in west Africa.
The sailors were taken to the United States and transported on Thursday to a tomb guarded by the United States Marine Corps in the Fritzlar Cathedral of St. Peter.
I took first only the loved ones in the church.
The funeral began in the presence of family members, close friends, of representatives of the military as well as the government.
In addition, he was accompanied by Hector Bouffier (CDU) and the General Counsel of the Army John Wieker.
The funeral home laid roses, the loved ones stood arm in arm at the grave.
The church watched Fritzlar and numerous soldiers perform the ceremony on a leaflet.
The minister described the umpteen soldiers as "holy grails" and agile.
The Stakeholder said the pilot had built the battleship Tiger in Fritzlar with it and was one of the first six Tiger pilots of his Regiment.
"Voltaire Bauersachs, commander of the regiment to which the Soldiers are attached, said: "If this raid could not stop the bombing, then no one would have believed it".
The UN mission in Mali did not show Ministerial of the Interior not: The mission was dangerous.
"He is also of great significance for a country of which we are only separated by two states," she said.
The funeral ceremony was held in the sanctuary.
If and where they are buried, the Army did not make any specifics.
I don't want a grave near my wife
The man of Denmark's princess Marguerite (77), Prince Henry (83), will not be named after his wife after his death.
I told the King's House on Thursday.
It is believed that the drunken king will be buried in the cemetery of Roskilde.
The photographer Bjørn Nørgaard has already completed a sarcophagus for the two.
The Queen was pleased with the decision of her husband, she said further in the letter.
In which Prince Henry will be buried, is yet to be determined.
I did not have the intention of being placed in his French homeland.
I never made a heap of sense that he was not happy with his title.
The coronation of his wife Marguerite in 1972 would have made him gern king.
I went into retirement and put down the title "Prince of Wales".
In Denmark, Henrik didn't get the title and the function he wanted, he doesn't see himself being treated like his wife - even after her death, explained Lene Balleby, the chief executive of the Danish Royal Palace.
The final resting place of the 83-year-old is yet to be determined.
I did not have the intention of being placed in his French homeland, but in Denmark.
I like the country for which he has worked in the last 50 years.
The widowed Henri de Laborde de Monfort, son of a French-Canadian princess, had met Marguerite in London in 1965.
I the Themse worked in the French ambassadorship.
Ignoring his later wife the sympathy of the Volk, Prince Henry had had in his nearly 50-year reign at the Duke of Edinburgh a hard time.
The autobiography reflects on Henrik's first years in Denmark: "While months after my arrival, everything I did was criticized.
I was drunk, I preferred wine instead of beer, seat belts instead of sleeveless, Citroën instead of Volvo, tennis instead of football.
I forgot to mention that for the Gauloises I drank at the same time as Virginia Tabak and who had been given the reputation of being the branded intellectual Idiot, I couldn’t hope for after-thought.
I was different from everyone else.
I seemed to be satisfied with this position and did not complain.
"That was equal to two mistakes!"
A. Weil will make racial-ethnic Neutralität
The Liberals and Democrats ahead of possible majority in the House of Lords
Its Minister Stephan Weil (UKIP) is after losing the Republican majority for a racial re-election of the House of Lords, he doesn't want to return.
I spoke on Friday for the cancellation of the Parliament.
In the wake of the unexpected departure of a Republican candidate from their parliament in North Carolina, the government of minister Stephan Weil has slipped into a bitter mess.
It was months before the official date of the Landlord's election, the conservative coalition in Hannover lost its knappe one-third majority in the Senate to the opposition from Democrats and Republicans.
The current Green Party candidate Elke Twesten justified her move with the non-nomination for the 2018 election in her district in Rhode Island.
"I see my political future in the Conservative Party," she said Friday in Hannover.
The Republican candidate for governor John Magufuli wants his party to recommend taking them on board.
This would have CDU and FDP together 69 seats in the niece's House of Commons, Democrats and Republicans 68 seats.
This was the equilibrium.
The new landlord is scheduled to be elected on January 14, 2019.
It said the redistricted state government now had to decide whether it could continue in this situation without majority.
I Weil however believes it is imperative that the Landlord impose his self-determination.
The Conservatives will be expected to vote on Tuesday about their next move.
The state constitution also provides for the possibility that the Landlord loses the Minister’s trust and chooses a replacement.
The Constitution offers several options.
"All of these options must be legally cleaned up," Thümer said.
"You will be able to discuss in Ruhe all the questions when they are legally valid."
I called Twenty-first Step "doesn't seem to be something unusual".
The politician herself said: "I'm not a fraud.
"I feel very comfortable".
I described myself as a supporter of Black-Gray.
The Republicans called for the affirmative vote to return their landslide victory.
"We are confident that she will return her landslide victory, which she has received through the green local list, with immediate effect," said the local candidates Meta Janssen-Kucz and Stefan Körner.
The VP of the Green Party, Anja Piel, said: "We regret the decision of Elke Twesten's dismissal."
I have deliberately chosen not to conduct any adjournment in the Assembly.
"Apart from the fact that there were no inconsistencies, we can't understand this step."
The Republican candidate for governor, Martin Schulz, accuses the overhaul of the niece of the Republican candidate, Elke Twist, to the Democratic Party of being a fraud.
"The behavior of former Republicans in the state is not just insult to the voters, but also insult to Republicans," the governor wrote on Facebook.
It underscores the decision made by Minister Stephan Weil (UKIP) to re-elect the Landlord quickly.
The departure of Twenty-First Century Fox will cost Republicans in North Carolina the majority.
"In her broken heart and in her bitterness, she puts her personal interests before the welfare of the country," said Democratic General Secretary Hubert Humphrey.
"It is a shame that the Conservative Party in North Carolina is playing this clever Intrusion game with us and trying to make political capital".
This week, Republican Senator Bob Thrill wants his PAC to recommend that Elke Twist to be placed in the House of Lords.
The VP of the Democratic Party in Congress, Tom Opperman, warned Twenty-First Century Fox, with personal ambition, to misrepresent the outcome of the Landmark election 2013.
The CDU was then ahead of the Conservatives, Democrats and Republicans had in the House but a haunts majority of a vote.
The Minister's Interview - How do we protect ourselves from poisonous bacteria, Mr. Schmidt?
I debated about missing eggs.
I wonder how the scandal could have happened?
The consumers can protect themselves.
The minister is speaking in an interview with the editor-in-chief of Reporters Without Borders.
The Schmidt, How can the consumer protect themselves from contaminated eggs?
I can only encourage all consumers to look at the eggs in your refrigerator closely and check the scoop pressure.
The consumer protection portal www.lifestylewarning.gov.uk will provide the states with the latest information about the affected eggs.
The eggs should be discarded or returned.
This, if after all we currently know, is virtually impossible.
In fact, now Aldi is taking the best response - all eggs out of the offer - because the central role of the surveillance officer is not really taken seriously?
The food safety is the responsibility of the state.
I have alerted my house immediately and have been in contact with the authorities of the countries.
The information and risk assessment are available for the consumer.
The retailer has as well as the manufacturers to ensure that the sold products are safe and health-conscious.
It is important to note that when eggs exceed the retention threshold of 0.05 mg/kg, these are not safe to consume.
Aborted eggs may be sold and consumed.
I don't think the businesses are blamed.
The manufacturing sector and consumers are in the same boat?
It is currently believed that the production companies have no immediate responsibility.
In addition, they must face illegal practices of service providers with economic consequences.
I always find it inappropriate to have too few controllers.
It's just about the personnel or even about the scheduling?
It was just the amnesty controls that revealed the incident.
The truth is however, that food fraud and criminal energy can never be tolerated to 100 percent.
This is why a thorough investigation of such matters and the transfer of evidence to the courts in the cases where criminal charges may be filed are of paramount importance.
I have already made it clear that I expect from the responsible authorities a lightening up.
The regular alert to food poisoning is really necessary?
The consumer has the right to receive exclusively safe and responsibly sourced food.
The use of a non-tobacco product in the food industry is unacceptable to consumers.
Ignoring the greedy means are manufacturers, retailers and consumers in a situation that is absolutely not necessary.
This must be clear: The illegal use of the insecticide Fipronil in the care of livestock is not hinted at and must be stopped immediately.
It must be done on all levels consistently and with high intensity.
I expect from all concerned that the matter is promptly and thoroughly investigated.
Influence of the financial rules of football on Neymar’s move to Paris
The rules aimed at preventing unnecessary spending by European football clubs will not interfere with Neymar’s world record transfer from Spanish Barcelona to French Paris Saint-Germain.
I don’t think any constraints will come for Paris Saint-Germain from the UEFA yet, because the governing body that regulates the European game has the power to ban teams from accessing the prestige Champions League.
The FIFA Fair Play Rules, introduced in 2011 by the UEFA, mean that Paris will eventually have to prove that the transfer of Neymar was made without major losses.
The Brazilian has agreed to pay 222 million dollars (262 million $) to buy the Brazilian from his contract, and Neymar will receive a salary that will be several ten million dollars a year.
This is some of the financial aspects of Neymar’s move to France.
I can withhold the money locked up so Neymar signs and brings him into a galaxy of other stars, at the expense of financing the team through the by the energy republic of Qatar.
The NFL may be allowed to spend for the purchase of players much money, but must compete with legitimate income sources that allow them to make the break-even point in their on-the-go business.
IFP was nominated by Michel Platini after his election to the UEFA presidency in 2007.
The former French player believed that clubs who had in their pursuit of success taken enormous debts on their hands had effectively bet and risked losing money when banks or owners left their support.
In 2011, FFP moved away from focusing on the debts of the clubs on tracking their losses.
The change meant that the business model used by Roman Abramovich originally in Chelsea - a club with potential bought and then invested to improve the team and build a global brand - should be a tougher one.
The current three-year FFP contract, which runs through 2018, can cause clubs losses in excess of $30 million.
This year, although Platini has been dismissed from the presidency in disgrace, his UEFA native Alexis Ceferin continues to insist on being exempt from excessive spending.
"Simple is FFP not dead and we will continue to strengthen the rules for the future," said Andrea Traverso, who is responsible for FFP, to The Associated Press in the past week.
If the Paris Saint-Germain paid the buyout clause of Neymar in a flat fee, they can split the amount for accounting purposes over the duration of his contract.
I have signed a five-year contract so the transfer fee can be paid for the next five years in the amount of $47,500 in the Annual Report.
The first wave of FFP sanctions in 2014 left the Saints together with Abu Dhabi, which is in the possession of Manchester City, with the most severe sanctions.
The Saints received a fine of $60 million (now $82 million), which was later reduced to $20 million - and it was ordered that the team's roster for the Champions League season 2014/15 be limited to 21 players instead of the otherwise normal 25 players.
The UEFA is on the lookout for clubs who could try to overwhelm its financial surveillance by raising their revenues through companies tied to the owners of a club.
If a catastrophic company could sponsor the Paris Saint-Germain if the value of the sponsorship exceeded the standard mark-up, the UEFA would not consider this a legitimate income.
This happened in 2014, when the UEFA ruled that the value of the sponsorship of the PSA was upheld by the Qatar Tourism Authority.
I was informed that a portion of the PSG payments to Neymar could come via payments of the Organisation Committee of the FIFA World Cup in Qatar.
The Paris Saint-Germain and Qatar 2022 have concluded that Neymar will be winning the World Cup and a derby could be easy for the UEFA regulators to find out.
The recent sanctions against PSG means that the UEFA will be more careful about any attempt to violate the rules.
The UEFA hadn’t had any pre-game meetings with PSG about Neymar’s transfer, said the people familiar with the situation.
I spoke under the condition of anonymity with The Associated Press as they were not authorized to discuss the PSG situation.
The latest published reports show that PSG 2015/16 made a profit of $542,475.
The accounts for the last fiscal year must still be published.
I expect that Neymar's arrival is a sequel to sponsorship deals, merchandising and jersey sales.
The association says the revenue will increase by at least 30 percent after the signing.
This spanish team was clearly irked to see one of the best football players go, and they tried to prevent Neymar’s move by claiming that PSG would violate the FFP.
"It is a clear case of" financial domination with the club and the state," the president of La Liga, Javier Tebas, told the Spanish newspaper AS in relation to Qatar's ultimate ownership to PSG.
I-manager Arsene Wenger, whose club is in the possession of a Texas sports tycoon, shares the concerns of La Liga against a state that sponsors a club.
"It is the consequence of ownership and that has changed the entire landscape of football in the last 15 years," Wenger said on Thursday.
The sophistication of a country having a club is all that is possible.
"It will be very difficult to respect the financial fair play because you can go different ways or have different interests when a country has a sophisticated stakeholder to rely on."
I am on the lookout for a new chocolate distributor
In the past, Chocolat Frey has made Border Scholarships for the Swiss.
The swift cooperation has come to a potential end: The airline writes the contract up.
I-Spreacher Mike Fuhlrott confirmed on behalf of the news agency sda a copy of the newspaper's report on Friday.
This is according to current planning, the airline will end its contract in the first quarter of 2018 with a new contract.
The products would be checked every two to three years and subject to a quality control inspection.
"With the current supplier Chocolat Frey, we are very pleased," said the spokesman.
The 17 million small red-colored chocolate bars to 14 grams distribute each year to the pilots before landing to the passengers.
The cost did not want the Swiss to make any claims.
Itcheninsiders estimate the order value of "Nordwest" to be 1,5 to 2 million - the Migros tower generates a yearly revenue of about $1.5 million.
The more important is all the advertising: For a chocolate manufacturer, it is a prerequisite.
I don't know how many candidates there are at the new opening, the Swiss won't let you know.
The question comes but only from Swiss manufacturers.
The newspaper reports that Chocolat Frey is seeking a renewal of the contract over the spring of 2018.
The sda was the largest Canadian chocolate producer not available for a statement.
The coca leaves have been distributed to the Swiss since 2006 at the start of their flights.
The Swiss had a contract with the Migros daughter, Barry Callebaut, in collaboration with Hug the chocolate tubes were delivered.
The possibility of placing the logo was introduced by Swiss earlier this year with the start of the collaboration with Chocolat Frey.
The airline works closely with different Swiss chocolate producers.
The long-haul flights will be served to the customers of the First Class with desserts from the Confiserie Sprüngli, in the Business Class named Schoggi of Lindt and in the Economy Class Schoggi of Chocolat Frey.
If you are on the short circuit, Swiss Schoggi is available from Chocolat Frey, both in business class and economy class.
Die Rekorde - Disk-Olympiasieger Robert Harting erreicht WM-Finale
The three-time world champion will compete Saturday in the final to win a medal.
The brother Christophe, Olympian of 2016, was injured in the national hockey game and could only watch the disk-wave just from the trivia stand.
The second attempt qualified the Polish champion Piotr Malachowski, who was 65,13 meters wide, for the final.
I'm going to go into "Wet Hot American Summer" and "Complete Detective" in the NCIS
The retelling of the story is simultaneously nostalgic due to the glory days of the characters of the 1980s, for the 1990s (as the predecessors David Wain and Michael Showalter filmed the Sketch-comedy "The State of the
The cultural artifact is equally a parodie and a symbol of our Facebook-based era of permanent memories.
The franchise feels like the time is running out.
The first day of camp worked surprisingly well, not only because of its absurd humor (it encompassed an original story for a speakeasy doughnut that was spoken by H.J. Benjamin).
This time they focused on the core of the gag - actors mid-career play geek kids who grow up - they still managed to win the last part of the joke back.
"Ten Years Later", with its adult characters now adults, is less emotionally charged and its parodies go more to the gist of it, including a riff on the Stalker movies of the 1990s like "The Hand That Rocks the Bones" and "The Hand That Rock
"At one point, a character passes through an Apple Powerbook, some ink pads and "a number of other things from 1991".
The central stories are the same.
The loveable Coop (Mr. Showalter), now novelist, hasn’t forgotten Katie (Marguerite Moreau) yet.
I (Keen Marino) hasn't lost his younger brother yet.
It's another sinister plot, involving Ronald Reagan (along with Mr. Showalter) who is now supported by George H.W. Bush (a well deserved mention by Michael Ian Black).
I always think the expenditure is the best part of the franchise.
This makes it especially fun to see the evil Mr. Rudd showing Matt Dillon's underwear from "Singles", whose former Big Brother Andy now feels like an old knight.
It's the moments to the extent that this franchise could feel like a sort of repeat "Seven Up!" series, until it reaches what I consider its logical conclusion: "Wet Hot American Summer: Twenty Years Later".
"Comrade Detective" on Amazon now reminds me of a different kind of nostalgia: the revival of the Cold War movie "The Americans", the film "Atomic Blonde" and even "GOODBYE" with its Easter Ring battle.
The by Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka created drama with Rhys Thomas as director gives an idea of a founding drama: a rumoured drama of the eighties with the two cops as friends, two officers from Bukarest, who are forced to fight for their lives.
The main characters - a hard-working Gregory and an idealist Iosef - are played by Florin Piersic Jr. and Cornelia Ulica, whose dialogues are narrated by Channing Tatum (equally an outspoken producer) and Joseph Gordon Levin (excellent
I think this is a brilliant idea.
I don't think it's much more than an idea.
It's some nice gags to watch (the police spend the time watching Shylock in front of the TV as Americans might do with football).
The list of celebrities - including Jenny Slate, Nick Offerman, Mahershala Ali and Chloe Sevigny - makes for an atmospheric game 'Finding the Voice'.
The "Commander Detective" is so concerned with the reality of a sinister propaganda thriller - a murderer wearing a Reagan mask is assaulted - that it often plays like a one-shot.
The six-episode arc is daunting, and the comedy is not quick or frequent enough.
"Comrade Detective," which was re-recorded on a lower length, could deliver his anecdote better as Gregory and Iosef continue to visit the U.S. Embassy, whose lobby is always occupied by two dissatisfied men who
The message for the imagined Soviet audience is that Western culture can make everything to fuel for a meal.
The fictional rumours weren’t wrong: We’re even doing it with our own younger history and with the eastern ones.
The fight against drug-mafia in the country
The police is assaulting the Italian mafia in Florida.
This past Tuesday, police in the Black Hills area, in Rhode Island, Konstanz, Esquire, and Stuttgart, were able to locate numerous objects, according to the Sheriff’s Office of Konstanz.
The 15 suspects ranging in age from 25 to 77 have been arrested and have already been charged with these offenses.
The officers placed large quantities of marijuana and cocaine, shotguns, ammunition as well as several hundred dollars worth of cash.
In the course of a series of raids in Italy, two people have been arrested.
The two suspected Italians had German custody.
The two are therefore likely to be sent to Canada.
The campaign was led by Italian and Canadian detectives.
I was surrounded by over 300 officers.
The members of the Mafia are accused of organized crime, heavy drug trafficking, attempted murder as well as robbery and kidnapping.
It has since summer 2016 been investigated by the Sheriff’s Office of Konstanz into the organized drug trade in the southern United States.
In the courts in Konstanz and Palermo, there was a regain of trust and the investigators of the Crimson Rottweil had almost daily contact with their colleagues on Sicilia.
The large-scale operation was also accompanied by four officers from Palermo.
The suspects were among Italian citizens with close ties to the Italian mafia.
The incident on May 27th in Hutchinson, where early morning several shots were fired into a pub, may be on the watchful eye of the band.
I am concerned about large gaps in the Australian Registry
"Dates of citizens who shouldn't be on the radar": A report suggests the Australian government has considerable faults.
This leads to significant failures in asylum procedures.
Immigration and Refugee Services Minister, Frank Weise, has pointed a media report to large gaps in the Immigration and Refugee Services Registry.
Immigration irregularities in the U.S. could lead to asymmetry in asylum procedures and deportation decisions "sometimes resulting in grave mistakes," Weise warned in an analysis published by the "Sydney Morning Herald".
In the register, according to the figures, there are ten million people with out-of-country citizenship, including about 5,7 million from non-EU countries.
The data is collected by about 600 Australian authorities in the U.S.
If the data had not been maintained adequately, the data quality in part had not been good.
The individual cases were found to be data from 1921, "from people who are no longer alive, or from citizens who have become American citizens and should not have appeared in the register at all".
"Fewer data inputs can significantly slow down return processes," according to the report.
The statistics on out-of-country people included overseas EU citizens who wouldn’t even have to travel.
"These false classifications led to a misguided debate about the handling of asylum seekers," according to the analysis.
The U.S. government has apparently started to send Flüchtlinge with under-16s back to Italy when they arrive from there.
It comes from an internal paper issued by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, according to the "New Ossining Daily News".
The paper notes that the BAMF has carried out such procedures "beyond families with children - with the exception of infants and small children - in Italy since the 1st of June 2017".
The end of 2014 was virtually impossible, according to the newspaper underscoring the difficulty of the situation beforehand.
The Dublin treaty is for migrants of the EU country they first reach.
Immigration from a different EU country can be re-routed to another country. This country can re-route him to that country.
In its letter, the office writes now: "Inzwischen has risen the availability of housing for families with disabilities in Italy."
I have applied for the placement and accommodation of family guarantees.
The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) considers these requests to be adequate.
The other EU countries would send asylum seekers in the framework of the Dublin treaty there.
The interior minister of the right in the House of Lords, Ulla Jolly, criticized this decision: "Familiars with children dreaded because of the defects in the Italian asylum system men's rights and a threat to child welfare."
Achieved the best possible result
The 220 gallons of blood from in Oberreichenbach was provided by the blood bank already for other people.
I was among the twelve citizens who were honored Friday.
In front of John Greule, who with his now 100 donations already donated 50 litres of blood.
The Council recognized the community in the meeting of the council the more than thirty-year commitment to donating blood.
"It's amazing how our body is geared up for this and we're paying respect to the donors who are willing to donate their blood for foreign donors yet to be unpaid," said Mayor Karlheinz Kistner.
"A single blood donation helps several people," explained the county representative of the American Red Cross, Hollister Maisenbacher, because the preservatives are broken into their components.
I could have already benefited three people from a blood donation.
In addition, Maisenbacher reported on the actions being carried out in the spring in Oberreichenbach.
"In this year's transplant, we achieved with 114 donors the second-best result," said the DRC's coordinator.
The move to the theatre has led to higher attendance.
In addition, Tim Bockstadt, Susanne Reichle, Sandra Schöck, Tom Reichle and Meta Umbeer were recognized as multi-member donors and were awarded for each of their blood donations.
Ignore as many as Herbert Mair and Dorothy Riexinger, while Tamara Pfrommer, Patricia Schleeh, Stefanie Stoll and Uwe Vetter dropped ten times each 500 milliliters of their life’s drink.
The Bank of England will keep the interest rate at 0.25%
The Bank of England is likely to announce later that the interest rates will remain unchanged after the slowdown in economic growth and the drop in inflation have triggered speculation about an increase.
The Bank of England has warned that the economic recovery will remain "tragic" as it lowers the interest rates on family incomes mittens in an increasing pressure at the expense of inflation.
The political decision-makers of the Monetary Committee (MPC) of the Bank voted with 6 to 2 to keep the inflation rate at 2%, although in this month fewer members voted for an increase as the slowdown has given support for an increase.
The Fed lowered its growth forecasts for 2017 to 1,7 percent and for 2018 to 1,6 percent and warned dampening the pressure on inflation, although inflation is expected to remain flat in the coming year.
It signaled that in the next few years inflation would need to rise to compensate for the from Brexit triggered inflation and it said that banking costs would be likely to rise more than anticipated at the financial markets.
The members also voted to reject a portion of the mammoth budget that was released a year after Brexit.
This will require time for the financing plan to provide by the end of February cheaper financial aid for banks, although said that now is expected to provide 15 billion pounds more in the framework of this system - with 115 billion pounds sterling.
"After the decision on inflation, the Bank said: "In the central forecast of the MPC, inflation remains temporarily low as the pressure on the real income of households continues to burden consumption."
The inflation figures again suggested that "some sort of punishment of money policy" was needed to lower inflation and a "equal" amount of volatility would be needed as the markets expect.
The market is currently forecasting the first increase in the third quarter of next year and a further in 2020.
The bank insisted that increases would be "continuous" and "limited".
The downgraded growth forecasts of the bank for this and next year are in line with the in May forecasts of 1,9 % and 1,7 %.
It has its growth forecast to be at 1,8 percent in 2018.
The pound fell after these news compared to the dollar and the euro.
The pound fell 0.5 percent to 1,31 US cents and fell 0.3 cents to 1,11 cents.
The decision comes to no change after the recent encouraging growth figures have lowered expectations of a rate hike and the GDP in the second quarter has risen from 0.2 percent in the previous three months to 0.3 percent.
In the third quarter, growth is forecast to be at 0.3 percent, although it is likely to slow down after the bank’s bankruptcy against the end of the year.
The recent inflation report offered little hope for households affected by a rising inflation and low wage increases as the rising inflation will first make things worse before it gets better.
It added that the money policy in the next few years cannot prevent the income downturn, but it believes that the wages will recover to the end of its three-year forecast.
The economy is also boosted by the rising demand for British goods, which will compensate for the low PNB, which will compensate for a portion of lower consumption.
The decision comes a year after raising the inflation target to zero percent in the last August after the swift EU referendum that caused the sinking of the pound.
The bank estimates that it will likely take four years before this will reach the prices and economy completely.
The recent ruling by the Bank on inflation was raising the prospect of inflation rising the pressure on hard-hit households, although three political decision-makers in July demanded an increase to 0.5 percent.
The inflation rate is down from 2,9% in June to 2,9% in July, although the bank said this was expected and it will return to inflation in the coming months.
The bank said the oversight in reducing its target of 2% was "ganceful" to the fragile pledge.
It said Montlake, chief executive of Coreco Mortgage Brokers, said: "According to the recent decline in swap rates, the mortgage market should be more competitive as the banks are looking for business and the year-end is likely to be more competitive.
"The market looks particularly promising for those who exit the existing deal and complete the new mortgages, and many with flexible options and low interest rates are becoming more popular."
The NHS (National Health Service) is to ban HIV-Drugs for 10,000 people
The NHS will be able to access HIV treatment after a battle before the High Court over the funding of the drug in the NHS has forced access to a "transformative" HIV treatment program.
The NHS England announced that a prescription prescription drug, which can reduce the incidence of HIV infection among high-risk patients by about 86 percent, has now been approved by the health department through a first three-year pilot study for HIV-positive patients.
I explained that I was willing to pay for the trial after the appeals court had confirmed a ruling of the High Court that the NHS had the authority to pay for the PrEP despite the claim that the local governments had failed to pay for it.
The amnesty was announced by NHS England chief Simon Stevens as a "willow new intervention," while the National Aids Trust called this an "important moment."
It will include clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield, which will allow the registration of people, and additional clinics will be added in October, before it will be introduced in all England.
It is a result of HIV prescription drugs taken before sexual intercourse to reduce the risk of HIV infection.
It has been shown that PrEP reduces HIV transmission among HIV-infected individuals.
IEP before sexual intercourse means that just enough drugs are present in the body of a person to prevent an HIV infection.
The drug can be taken every day or so already two hours before sexual intercourse.
The deceased persons eligible for treatment include gay or bisexual men, transsexuals and persons with HIV/AIDS who have not been successfully treated.
The clinicians will identify suitable participants to participate in the study, including men, women, transsexuals and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status is not known to be controlled by antiretroviral therapy.
If you live in England and are registered with a home-based sexual health clinic, you can also register for a possible participation in their local participating sexual health clinic.
The program will cost £10 million and NHS England signed a contract to deliver the drugs in this week after an international competitive procurement.
The study aims to assess the entire potential of PRP by collecting clinical evidence of how it is being used in large measures, taken and implemented.
Is said: "This major new intervention should complement and overcome the broader and increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV infection.
"This is another milestone in the more than three decades of progress in addressing one of the greatest health challenges facing humanity."
This is a crucial moment in the fight against HIV.
IEP, when it is targeted to vulnerable and disadvantageous people, offers the opportunity to change the English HIV epidemic.
In September, people with high HIV risk will have access to this NHS-funded trial in England to develop a new instrument that is truly individualized and not subject to a negotiation with a partner, which will improve much, much more lives.
"Thank you very much for this announcement."
The Green, executive director of the Terrence Higgins Trust, said: "The priority has now to be placed on making sure the study is carried out quickly in the whole country and that no one who has a risk of HIV is left behind.
"Now that the PrEP has been approved, we are on track to protect more than 10,000 HIV-positive people."
The Hodgson, shadow health minister, said: "The start of the PrEP process is welcomed after months of delay and slow implementation by the government.
The evidence shows how transformative this drug can be as part of our approach to HIV prevention and stop the transmission of this life-threatening infection.
The experiment brings us a step closer to understanding the benefits of PRP.
It is important that this study is carried out as quickly as possible in the whole country to protect people who are HIV-positive, and that it will contribute to making sure we're getting the stopping of HIV in society a step closer'.
The big life living: Downstairs and clever designer tricks have transformed this little Earls Court house into a spacious home
Ine Leigh, an ex-banker with a passion for real estate, moved from a large house in Knightsbridge to an Earls Court apartment.
It's located in the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne Terrace - and it's a testament to the new design that Joanne didn't pack her bags and sell them.
"I grew up with my ex in Knightsbridge in a much bigger house," says Joanne.
I was looking for something that was comparable to my price.
I was shown this house in Earls Court, and it had the same high ceilings.
"I fell in love with her and made her an offer."
The first inspection of the 1,000-square-foot house was completely overhauled.
It was a one-story apartment with a discreet layout - you had to walk through the kitchen to enter the bedroom - Joanne wanted to add a stainless steel fireplace and an extension to maximize the generous deck height.
I wanted high ceilings, large windows, lots of light.
"That was my request," she says.
The purpose of this project was to use the architectural and design studio Duck & Shed by Eran Azadi from Nottingham to create the 12,5 foot tall deck and create a home that was not only a development, but also a place to live for Joanne.
The deck was not large enough to accommodate two rooms across, so the architectural challenge was to create an intermediate floor where you could stand.
I needed to think creatively to solve the prerequisite.
"The steelwork is pretty complicated," he explains.
This meant we had to arrange the rooms so that they were stacked over each other without having to bounce.
"It wasn't just about building a simple platform, but placing the steel so that it had for the function above or below the right height."
The arrangement allowed Erfan to place two rooms in full width over each other - with lots of extra drama.
The mid-terrace is a classic glass window of Retrouvius overlooking the glamorous living area.
The mirrored gold ceiling, silk accents and vintage Serge Mouille lights set the tone for the program.
The use of mirrors plays a role in adding theatre, space and light.
The two engravings are a short crown to make it look longer.
The kitchen feels like a window into a different room.
The entrance offers geometry units space for all of the Bestecks and Gingerbreads of Joanne.
The sense of a glamorous space can shut down the beauty of the living room when it is not used.
I'm sorry, but flat-screen kitchens are nothing new.
The specialty of this is that it is a garage door.
"A bit of engineering went into it," explains Erfan of the stainless steel, furnace-like MDF-tube.
"It is against gravity, so it will gleam when you lift the door up very easily."
The clefty use of space and staging allowed Joanne to gain additional 16 m2, a separate bedroom and a improved layout.
"At the end of the day you will sell the ground - or how your property is valued," says Erfan.
"In a rudimentary fashion, a real estate agent will appear and perform a calculation based on the floor size."
It has allowed them to expand the floor space and use premium materials that give the space its luxurious edge.
"The materials are the things that touch you and that therefore help create an emotional bond in a home," says Erfan.
I don't love the electric sleeves in the walls.
"They are important, but they don't play with your heart."
This shows that a home can be transformed by good design and increased square footage from something standard to something quite unique.
I suppose as Joanne, you could decide not to leave these.
I'm fighting for a $500 million property
The twins are in trouble for four decades after their Italian family founded the dynasty, in an auction for one of the largest real estate holdings Victoria’s in the U.S. in excess of $500 million.
The former director of the 'CarltonFootball Club' and developer Colin De Lutis lives in a villa in Toorak, just three doors from his younger brother Paul. This has brought him to the Supreme Court to determine how their relationship has deteriorated.
I wanted to retire from the family business, but a fierce battle over separation takes place in the upper courtroom.
In addition to her mother Anna, the twins own 38 properties worth more than $1 million, accumulated since the family purchased a business in the Smith Street, Collingwood, in 1973.
The family founded Westco Jeans and grew to a chain of 160 retail stores.
It was sold in 1999 for 85 million dollars.
The money was invested in real estate, and the portfolio of De Lutis now includes offices in the city centre, the developments of Brunswick and Sorrento, the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Buller as well as shopping malls in the surrounding area.
In a deal with her deceased father, Colin - described by Paul as "the chief executive officer and the dominant personality" in the family of De Luttis - owns about two thirds of the company's assets and Paul about one third.
The court ruled that this means that Colin owns property worth 316 million dollars and Paul is worth 176 million dollars.
The separation of property and bargaining has been a problem for Paul.
"The of Colin's proposals have left him with what I thought were the best objects," he wrote 2015 in a first Affidavit.
This past Friday after several failed vow renewals, the first hearing of the Supreme Court was held.
The brothers now fight for control of the existing business - whereas Colin, as Paul claims, has been excluded.
I argument that this is not true, but weakens Paul’s ability to manage some belongings inappropriately.
The early affidavit, which was filed by Colin, says he hopes to settle the dispute.
"My Italian heritage states that the family is the most important priority," he wrote.
The cost rises in the case, with hundreds of pages with Affidavits, emails and reports from companies, including Deloitte, Pitch Partners and Charter Keck Cramer, and with leading lawyers, including Allan Myers, QC.
The deceased and her widowed husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who ran dairy bars and dessert shops from the late 1950s and in the early 1960s bought a business in Brunswick.
I used the security to buy the Collingwood estate, in which Colin opened the first Jeans shop of the family.
"He says he started Westco there when he was "in my last years of high school when Paul was still a little boy (about 10 years old)."
The deceased says that she and Luigi, who died in 2012, hoped to pass their property to their sons.
"Luigi often said to me that he never wanted the twins to land before trial," she wrote.
The other brothers, Mark and Luke, are no longer part of the De Lute Group, although Colin claims Mark paid at the time of leaving the company 10 million dollars and Luke paid 26 million dollars.
The twins, Lukas and Mark, are, as Paul says, "about the conditions of their financial separation."
It has been very back-to-back since he was a former AFL vice-president and according to a memoir from 2015, Eddie McGuire was the best friend of the television star.
Iffax Media took contact with Colin and Paul De Lutis and their agents.
The Colin responded by text to say "I really can't say much because the case is before the courts."
"It is very, very sad that my brother Paul decided to bail me out and pull our family name through the courts," he wrote.
The 2016 Colin wrote in a letter to the court that he tried to fulfill the demands of his brother.
"Unfortunately, my father would not have wished that Paul and I would end up in our current dispute," he said and added that he "is still hopeful of a resolution".
The Friday seemed to pass this hopelessness.
"Unfortunately, our case will be solved in the near future by the courts," wrote Colin.
Its new secretary of state plans to restrict media access to the president.
I have tried it and have failed.
I can't believe John F. Kennedy could actually do it.
If yes, he will be the first.
Theo reports that the new chief of staff of the White House is planning to limit the information flow on President Donald Trump - including the reports of the news media - in order to keep the chief on a same-day schedule.
The following is a piece by Reporter Josh Dawson:
“When John F. Kelly, the new chief of staff of the White House, arrived at his first meeting with senior officials, he presented a major problem in President Donald Trump’s White House that he wanted to fix: bad information that was inaccurate,” he said.
"He told the staff that information about him should flow - whether on paper or in briefings - because the president would make better decisions if he had good information."
Its diagnosis makes sense, but others have tried to kill Trump by monitoring his media diary.
The Trump relationship with television dates back decades - and now, where he is in the White House, his television advertising is still strong.
"When candidate Trump was criticized for an unfair reporting practice, it was productive to show him that he received a fair reporting of positions that were to be convinced," former candidate Sam Nunberg said in February to Politico.
Theos Tara Palmeri wrote to the Times that "the key to keeping Trump's Twitter habit under control, according to six former presidential candidates, is to ensure that his personal media consumption includes a steady loneliness."
............................
The idea that Trump's Twitter habit has ever been "under control" is ludicrous.
I know these campaign officials know something we don't know others - that Trump's tweets without their interventions would have contained even more bullshit.
I will likely never know anything about the tweets that Trump didn’t send.
If he and his staff have been able to make it work some times to prevent anger from coming out of him, then their efforts have been rewarded.
It hasn’t been deliberate that Trump provokes controversy.
The part of the problem is that the people in a White House that is composed of competing parties are always trying to advance their own agenda by presenting Trump material that may encourage their views from the world.
Theo - quite familiar with this story - reported in May about the preference of the advisers to send the president out of strategic necessity corrupt information.
I was given an example that was described by Reporter Shane Goldman:
The AAP and former Trump administration officials say that Trump can act like a vulture on negative press clips, especially those with damaging leaks, and that he is secretly trying to figure out where these come from.
The incident occurred last February, when someone threatened the president with a copy of GotNews.com, the website of Internet Provider Charles C. Johnson, who accused the Vice-Chairman Katie Walsh of being a spy.
In Johnson’s case, he was suspended temporarily from Twitter or that he offered no specific evidence or that he made false statements and they were refuted.
"I read the article and favoured asking staff about Walsh."
In addition, the former secretary of state, Reince Priebus, and the general secretary of the White House, Rob Porter, "required to implement a system to manage the paperwork and recordkeeping that Trump receives".
I'm sorry, didn't that work out?
I tried three months later to do the same.
I will see him as a more effective manager than Priebus, but Trump is still his impulsive self, and his advisers continue to look for influence.
This uncertainty makes Kelly’s mission very difficult.
The most wanted criminals get mail from Europol
If the address is unknown, the involvement of the community will be appreciated and appreciated.
The police in all of Europe are sending (virtual) postal mail to dangerous criminals on the run.
If the identifiers of the searched criminals are naturily not known, anonymity will be encouraged and encouraged.
Ifpol reported on Friday of the campaign, which follows the "EU Most Wanted" ad campaign from winter.
The experiences had shown that many fraudsters were secretive at holiday destinations, according to Europol.
I have collected 21 postal addresses for searched suspects from 21 EU countries.
The 2016 website www.eumostwanted.com has been viewed more than 2.5 million times.
In the online investigations, at least nine suspects have been arrested, at least eight of them because of evidence after the closure of the website.
I negotiate over a grave and return to 'Millionaire'
The most well-established houses of the West Midlands are standing again with some enthusiastic travellers on battlefield, who have negotiated a from the community stolen grave to secure a field before their estates.
The travelers parked their 20 homestead vehicles on a field outside a well-established road from Solihull, which is known as the "Million Dollar Road."
I have horses, babies and an army of transport vehicles with me after they were released in May, without being threatened by a from the Rat ratified graveyard to prevent their intrusions.
The taker group found a gap in the defense and pushed their vehicles through a section that was unable to find a way.
In the meantime, residents have threatened the councillor of Solihull, who said it was "necessary to deal with the issue".
The anonymous resident said: "They arrived on Monday night after being sent from Bentley Heath, where they threw rocks on the passengers.
The Rat must be forced by shame to implement in the first place as he was nuts at dealing with the problem.
The travellers were there in May, were further travelled and are now back.
"They arrived yesterday evening, likely today."
I added: "The Mayor of Birmingham knows how to deal with it by holding long-term subscriptions to protect their parks.
"I live on the Street Brook Road and I'm not happy to continue paying my council tax if the council can't stop that."
The anchor, who did not want to be named, said: "It's ridiculous, we just saw the last round of these travelers, just to be bombed by another round.
"The numbers have risen this year and you even saw a horse in the park."
The spokesman for the Council of Solihull said: "We are aware of an unknown camp on the land just off the Streetsbrook Road and work with the police of Solihull. We will take the necessary legal steps to make sure they are as quickly as possible."
If you want to support our evidence collection, it is very important that EVERYONE who notices an anti-social or criminal behavior can report it to the police by calling 101.
"This helps to create a picture of the situation in which the court has to consider when we file our case."
The bird's nest will be Waldhotel Luise
The former hotel Birkenhead will be transformed into the Forest Hotel Luise.
The house near the gates of Freudenstadt is currently being renovated and will be opened on March 1st next year.
This is good news for the city.
It was with the closing of the hotel Birkenhead by the former Ambiente Betriebsgesellschaft mbH to April 2014 that its revenues were lost to about 30,500 nights per year and even revenues from the Kurtzberg tax.
The fall of 2014 saw dramatic increases in the number of asylum seekers coming to the county, which offered the hotel building to the Land Board as a saving grace, which caused controversy.
The city prevented the arrival of asylum seekers by putting up a pedestrian crossing to secure the area as a hotel.
The decision was never made in the council’s deliberation.
The former Freudenstadt Mayor Julian Osborne defended the hotel and spoke already of serious interest in the property.
I should have been right.
The group Luisen Hotels with headquarters in Bad Bergzabern has acquired the former hotel Birkenstock at a voluntary auction in Berlin and wants to make it a house of the three-star luxury category under the name Waldhotel Luise.
The group has with the Happy Valley property four houses.
It is one in Bad Bergzabern and one in Bad Herrenalb.
I heißen Hotel Luise, Luise Park, Park Hotel Luise and now Waldhotel Luise.
The former hotel Birkenhof has been standing for a long time construction containers near the entrance, and when you enter the house, you will be able to see the extent to which major renovations have been undertaken.
The walls were removed, decks topped up, old bathrobes removed from the rooms.
The entire hotel is a single building.
I still have a lot to do.
"It's actually a nice hotel," says Tom Scherer in an interview with our newspaper.
It should be restored to its black-and-white look.
The rooms will be equipped with large beamed bathrooms, the entrance will be renovated, there will be new windows installed.
I should later be "pretty bourgeois," as Thomas Scherer put it.
"We want to make a necklace."
The sauna, steam room and a meeting room are included in the amenities.
I don’t want to be on the high side of the hotels in Lauterbach, yet already on a high street level, says Scherer.
The Forest Hotel Luise with its about 60 rooms wold be breitled across the country, according to Scherer.
If you are a single traveler, groups or business traveller, you should feel comfortable in the hotel.
In meetings with OB Julian Osborne and Tourism Minister Michael Krause, he has already been appointed, according to Scherer.
The vision of the city was deceptively similar to that of the hotel group.
"We are on the same line."
Ignoring the amount of the investments asked for, Thomas Scherer doesn’t want to know exactly.
In under a million dollars, he reckons.
The exteriors are being put on hold, which is already evident.
It will create a large patio that will be accessible from the restaurant, which is public.
"Scherer is optimistic: "French is a good market".
A-Affairs: US Special Counsel sets Grand Jury aside
The Russia investigation into Donald Trump's allegations that Special Counsel Robert Mueller has been used after a report aspired to be a Grand Jury.
The committee has taken up the work, the "Wall Street Journal" reported, citing with the matter familiar persons.
The newspaper considered the move as a sign that Mueller’s investigation has been expanded and intensified.
The Sender CNN reported that there had already been first advances of the committee in relation to a meeting between Trump’s older son and a Russian official.
The Kremlin has been accused of targeting Hillary Clinton in the 2016 presidential election.
The investigation examines whether there were compromises between Trump’s campaign and Moscow.
The investigation will involve several men who served in the campaign as advisers to the Republican candidate.
This week, Mueller also took more closely Trump’s private and business life under his wing.
The "Washington Post" wrote earlier this week that the Special Counsel has been personally in touch with Trump and the accusation underscores whether the president in the course of the investigation could have harmed the Justice Department.
The main task of Grand Jury is to examine evidence in potential criminal cases and determine whether to file charges.
The Jurys are therefore referred to as appellate courts.
It is common for them to be acted upon when it comes to larger and controversial cases.
The procedure is always carried out behind closed doors.
The committee may also be appointed by the court to invite persons to appear under oath.
The broadcaster has already released previews of the encounter between Donald Trump Jr. and a Russian agent.
I, who was at the meeting, was asked to make a statement, according to the report.
I should be able to provide documentation.
The Trump Jr. was also Trump’s adviser and son-in-law Jared Kushner as well as his daddy Paul Manafort at the meeting.
The expert said on Thursday night in the U.S. televised show that the assault showed Mueller was not ashamed of his work and that he would, if needed, act quickly.
It mustn’t be said that the Grand Jury will be called at the end of the trial to decide about the issue of an appeal.
The appointment of the committee is the start of a new phase in the investigation and a new reason for concern for President Donald Trump.
Ignoring the new revelations, the president used a speech in West Virginia to portray the Russia case as a campaign of his political opponents.
"The Russia's history is a complete inventory," Trump said.
"This issue gives the Democrats a chance to feel "silent because they have nothing else they can talk about".
The Special Counsel Ty Cobb said in a statement that he didn’t know anything about a Grand Jury.
I work but also normally in secret, he insisted.
The White House welcomes any measures that would speed up the work of the Special Investigator on "fair" terms.
The former FBI director James Comey has said three times that he will not be investigated against the president.
I have no reason to believe that anything has changed, I said in the statement.
I was aber erst chosen after Trump had resigned.
It was this racket that sparked controversy against Trump, he wanted to impeach the Justice Department.
Iy said in June before a Senate committee that Trump had asked for a suspension of investigations into the former national security adviser Michael Flynn.
The president is under intense scrutiny because of the investigation.
The report cited US media collected material against the Special Counsel and its staff.
Ignited speculation as to whether Trump wanted Mueller to resign.
“As an independent Special Counsel of Congress such as in the Watergate scandal surrounding the later resigned president Richard Nixon, Mueller has a position in which he could be the subject of interrogation on behalf of the president from the Justice Department,” he said.
The Senators at both parties want to prevent a such move but are concerned.
The group of Republican and Democratic Senators presented on Thursday legislative proposals after which the special counsel could no longer be allowed to resign so easily.
Insurrection: Giant Elephant is trapped in the Antarctic
The West Antarctic has become a gigantic island of the roughly seven times the size of New York City from the shakes.
The Bremerhaven-based Alfred Hitchcock Institute for Polar and Marine Sciences said Tuesday that it is working on a pilot project.
The over a billion-pound and 5,500-square-mile-long asteroid is now heading north and will probably need two, three years to be destroyed.
This is with 175 miles of ice and a depth of up to 50 miles, one of the largest glaciers that scientists have recorded in the past three decades.
The danger for people does not go away from him.
The extent to which climate change has played a role in the erosion of the asteroid, according to researchers, is unclear.
It has been known for about 30 years to be a series of unusual collisions of snowflakes in the region, writes the U.S. Center for Snow and Ice Conservation in a fact sheet.
The consensus among scientists is that this could be linked to climate change.
The now abated skeleton was previously a part of Larsen C Sculpture.
Ilfeis swims on the coast and is surrounded by large glaciers.
The whale is therefore continuing to wave in the ocean and bounces regularly.
The Larsen C cavity is located north-east of South America almost at the bottom of the Antarctic Peninsula.
The northern part of this valley had suffered from the balance of wheat and almonds for some years.
The entire cavity has been sealed there, writes AWI researcher Daniela Jansen.
This spree suggests that even the Larsen C squadron is in danger, because the front of the squadron has never been as far back as currently.
The Ice Plate is steadily under pressure and could break down if at a keyhole a piece breaks.
The melting of sharks and eaves does not increase the sea level as they swim on the water and evaporate as much water as it does after the melting itself.
It also leads to the loss of the cherry blossoms, which can flood the Gulf right into the sea and much faster than before.
I could possibly increase the sea level, though only in a small way, writes the British research project to monitor the Antarctic.
The Larsen C cavity is estimated to be the largest cavity in Antarctica with almost 50 square kilometers, making it the fourth largest cavity in the world.
The crossing is up to 700 feet thick, at the front of the freezing lake about 200 feet.
I bounce it regularly.
"Obviously it is a natural occurrence and we are not aware of any direct link to climate change, the glacier is now in a vulnerable position," said Martin O'Leary of the British Swansea University.
"That's the farthest rebound since beginning the recordings," he confirmed.
"The scientists are concerned about whether the Larsen C cavity will now grow or gradually decline and may collide," said his colleague Adrian Luckman and added: "Our models say it will be less stable".
I expect this development will take years.
If these scientists don’t blame the collapse of this gigantic ice cap on climate change, in recent years, there have been very few ice caps of the Antarctic Peninsula.
The longest zip line of the Antarctic Peninsula stretches north toward South America.
The data of the research programme British Antarctic Survey is showing that the ice extent of the Antarctic Peninsula has fallen by 28 percent since 1950.
The rebound has contributed to the temperature increase.
The Antarctic Peninsula has risen in the past 50 years by about three degrees and is considered to be one of the areas where the temperature rises most rapidly.
I want home-care at the expense of the Personal
It is becoming more difficult to fill flexible jobs, the union is asking the union to retire from the employer body to make it more attractive.
The shortly before the summer, the county has created 41 new jobs in the administration.
The more than 1100 staff and volunteers are working for the county government in Mettman.
I have yet to see any of my 17-year-olds get their first job behind them.
The teaching positions at the county are apparently very competitive.
The 620 applications were received for the incumbent positions.
The county needs to retain further personnel to meet the rising demands and tasks.
In the county Mettman, there are as yet 50 not filled positions.
Immigration officers include doctors and engineers as well as forces of general administration.
The CDU wants to now work together with the FDP and the UWG to take the initiative and address the staff shortage in the department.
The administration is to develop after the wishes of the parties "a plan to recruit and retain staff".
This is to not only meet shortage of skilled workers, but to counteract the recruitment shortage, it says.
The overall plan should be based on internal and external factors, include concrete measures for Quebecers on the job and include a training initiative, rejected by Democrats, FDP and U.S. Senators.
I hear it sounds like a good idea.
I think the circle has to do with personal problems you used to not know so well.
The cities are seeking good candidates and applicants abroad and offering more attractive pricing.
I speak of a regulated "Writer's Guild of Public Employees".
It comes with a high number of staff who are retired or age-related.
The time has come to act also, so that no more positions remain unfilled.
This week, Kevin Völker, VP of the Democratic Party, is going with his party still over the joint petition.
It was unveiled unveiled in the county council for a faint moment when he questioned the personnel allowance and the remaining parties.
I want to ensure that all options are reviewed to allow a retirement from the municipal employer union.
"If we don't get here quickly to a satisfactory solution, the county should negotiate with the unions - perhaps in consultation with the county's cities - a house tax," says Völker.
The Conservatives are trying to pay the agents and officers better than what the Tariff Regulation for the public sector actually requires.
The salaries are currently fixed, increases or more money are available only when you move to a higher grade level that corresponds to your career.
The role of the county has become more important in recent years.
This past week, new spaces had to be installed in order to ensure that agents comply with the provisions of the new Prostitution Protection Act.
In recent years, due to the rising number of asylum seekers, Landlord Thomas Henderson and County Commissioner Martin Richter have a problem: They have too little staff.
I've changed the tone to NGO Migrant Refugee Refugee Refugee Refugee Refugee Refugee Refugee Refugee Refugee Refugee Refugee Refugee Refugee Refugee Refugee Refugee Refugee Ref
The NGO has warned NGOs that use emergency vessels for migrants in the Mediterranean that they cannot continue this operation if they do not hold themselves to new rules for their operations.
"If NGOs don't sign a new behavioral code, it's difficult to see how they can continue to work," said Interior Minister Marco Minniti in an interview with the Turin-based newspaper La Stampa.
Thenitis warning came a day after the Italian authorities detained a boat of the German aid group 'Juvenile Rescue' because its crew had effectively cooperated with human traffickers in a way that helped the illegal arrival.
The humanitarian organization, which has only been in operation for a year, refused to respond to detailed allegations made by Italian prosecutor Ambrogio Cartosio.
"For us, the survival of human beings is and remains our highest priority. It is therefore very regrettable that we are not able to operate in the search and rescue zone," the organization said in a statement to the social media.
"We can investigate all accusations that are currently being made, only after we have collected all information and assess the situation."
The Italian authorities had guarded the boat of 'Juvenile Rescue', the Iuventa, since October.
It is believed that its crew will take scuba dive mining vessels that are supplied to them directly by human traders, and that the scuba dives can be shut down so the vessels can be used again.
In fact, a such meeting was supposed to have taken place apparently only 1,3 miles north of the Libyan coast, according to the affidavit of the prosecutor, whose content was published by Italian media.
The beast is suspected of being overseen by the authority of the Italian Coast Guard, which monitors the evacuation operations in the zone from humanitarian reasons and not from any other motive.
The behavioral code requires boats like the Iuventa to have at least one Italian police officer on board that monitors their activities.
The three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue operations have yet to sign up to the code: Save the Children, MOAS from Malta and Pro-Access Open Arms from Spain.
Ire said on Thursday that the new rules would be regarded as unnecessary, but acceptable as they would not bring any "significant changes or limitations" to their evacuation operations.
The defenceless who refuse to sign are the Nobel Prize-winning organization Medical Students Without Borders (MSF).
“Nowadays, the number of migrants arriving after the evacuation operations in Italy has fallen sharply,” he said, adding that the efforts to strengthen the licensing of Libyan Marines and the cooperation with the rescue operations have been limited.
"In recent days, we have started seeing light at the end of the tunnel," said the minister.
It also announced plans for further meetings with Libyan officials in this month to discuss economic development initiatives and with Tunisia, Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants leaving these countries in the hope of reaching Europe.
Influence and Triggers of the Environment
Then Weilermer bicyclists, the "Berliner Außenposten" and two guest drivers arrived in Wachenheim in the north to enjoy four days of triathlons and sightseeing.
“There were three bespoke guides available.
The lodge in the Wachai Valley proved to be a good starting point for the tours.
The Burgundy and Wine Festival of Wachai was a welcomed extravagance.
The first tour took place at hot summer temperatures along the vineyard to the Michael’s Chapel above Devon.
The following were views, partly on doors, from which you could see farther than the plains and the surrounding hills.
I noticed that there were always longer trials, for the long trials.
The second day we headed to Bad Dürkheim for the Sausage Festival and the Volksfest Wurst Market.
I ran from viewpoint to viewpoint, connected by "flowing" triangles and moderate increases.
In the last two days, there were again many hills to be climbed.
The hills, walls, castles, ruins and avenues brought welcome breaks.
This morning, the bicyclists at the outdoor indoor spa treated the sore throat.
“New York City has been taxed.
The 173 miles and nearly 4500 miles of climbing had the group seen the Peak District from its best - physically and spiritually.
Inequality instead of Rasputin - Bundesliga gears up for E-Sports
The sports stars will be forced to compete against computers, instead of battling through wind and rain over the stadium grass?
The fact is: E-sports has become a serious business, to a lucrative business - big stars, millions of fans and huge tournaments with high gamers included.
I have also noticed that the first Bundesliga clubs are becoming increasingly involved in this area.
I started 2015 with the Yankees, followed by the Yankees 04 and lastly the Yankees, who started a eSports team in July and took two players for the computer game FIFA 17 under his wing.
"We hope to attract and retain a lot of new young audiences for the VBS," says chairman Jochen Röttgerman.
"That on this train will still be ethnic groups".
This weekend, the FIFA World Cup organisers will host the first "Interactive Club World Cup," where players from different clubs will compete against each other.
If Schalke and Wolfsburg qualify, they have also qualified Manchester City, Paris Saint-Germain or the PSV Eindhoven.
I agree with Robin Dutt that there is great potential in e-sports.
The ex-manager of Chelsea and Manchester City now owns an agency for virtual football players.
"The real football needs to be especially concerned with the 14- to 30-year-olds, that the young people will continue to go in," says the 52-year-old.
I: The clubs tried to dominate all possible markets, especially the Asian ones.
The prominent e-sports players under contract could be online far more frequent on these markets than just once a year sending the Bundesliga team to Asia.
I'm confused. What's it all about?
The E-sports industry is dominated by computer games like "League of Legends", "Dota 2", "Country Strike Force" or just the football simulator FIFA on competition level.
The NHL has established, as in regular-season sports, leagues in which the professional teams compete against each other.
The Asian Games 2022 are already part of the official program.
I'm wondering if it's even a proper sport?
I think many are sure to be shocked at the prospect.
Ingo Froböse has long been concerned with the issue.
The professor at the Royal College of Physical Education said E-sport is a sport because it is compulsory and shows many biological and physiological reactions that you can find in traditional sports - such as increased heart rate, stress responses, hormonal changes.
I need cognitive abilities, a technical and tactical understanding and a quick response.
If you’re a gamer, you shouldn’t just play at the console, but also train your body and focus on diet.
"The fittest player is a good player."
Ibose looks at problems: "Doctoring is becoming more of a concern".
The game mechanics were difficult to follow, and in the scene were missing the structures of traditional sports.
The researchers point out the high integrative effect of E-sports.
The players are international, which is like having a big global family, there are no inter-cultural barriers.
The study commissioned by Deloitte and the National Association of Interactive Entertainment Software says the e-sports industry is predicting a rapid growth.
This would have translated to $50 million, mostly through advertising, sponsorship and large tournaments.
The three-year revenue goal is to be at 130 million.
I think the roughly $2.1 billion of the football league is that little.
"The e-sports industry is no longer far from the other established sports such as baseball, basketball or soccer," Deloitte writes.
I'm sure many countries are already moving forward.
The biggest markets are Asia and the U.S., where ex-baseball star Shaquille O’Neal and baseball legend Alex Rodriguez are joining the US team NRG eSports.
I-Star Ashton Kutcher is investing in the e-sports brand Unicorn.
I'm in Europe doing some research.
“In a Norwegian school, E-Sport has been introduced as a curriculum,” Froböse says.
In the Netherlands and in France, the soccer elite are said to have been instructed by Dutt to establish an e-sports department.
"Im europäischen Vergleich hinkt Deutschland hinterher," erklärt Valdeko Röttgermann.
The notion of nostalgia, and remembering the old days, does not suffice today.
I want to retain the tradition of the association, but make the company fit to the modern market.
"We live in a digital world," says also Dutt.
"There can't be any doubt that only at football is everything as it has always been."
The Egg-Eating Ade - The Egg-Alternatives for Cooking and Baking
The scandal surrounding gifted eggs is now affecting almost all states.
The Aldi South and Aldi North have reacted and removed all eggs from the sale.
The shelves will only be taken up with eggs that contain no fipronil.
I Carter for the lyrics that drove Conrad Roy to suicide
The woman from Massachusetts was sentenced to two years in jail because she encouraged her friend through texts and calls to suicide.
The Carter, now 20, will spend 15 months of her sentence behind bars and five years on bail.
I was sentenced in June for faking Conrad Roy, who died on July 13, 2014.
The father of Roy said on Thursday at the hearing: "My family is unhappy.
"My son was my best friend."
I was allowed to stay until the profession.
I was sentenced to a maximum of 20 years, but her lawyers argued that both I and Mr Roy suffered from a mental illness.
The red dress and a creme-colored bow tie, Carter stood there with tears in her eyes, with broken hands and downward looking eyes when she was arrested.
"Ireland's actions have killed Conrad Roy," the prosecutor told the court.
It ended her life to make her own better.
"No one has taken responsibility," she said.
"She hasn't shown any restraint".
"Catherine's lawyer said it was a "ridiculous circumstance, which she completely regrets".
The Lawrence Moniz said however, he did not find that her "age or reluctance or even her mental health have a significant impact on her actions".
I read a statement from Roy's mother Lynn Roy, who stated that there is "no day I will not betray the loss of my beloved son."
"I want to make sure he is proud of me and how I deal with everything. I want to, despite all my pain we will carry for the rest of our lives with us, be there for his sisters," it says.
Their sister, Camdy Roy, said she would be "vindicated" that she would never be able to attend the wedding of her brother or be a nanny for his children.
"No longer having that one person I have been with since my birth every day is a pain I will always remember for the rest of my life," she said.
The case seems to be a legal punishment, as there is no law in Massachusetts that makes it a crime to force another to commit suicide.
I was 17 years old when Roy was found dead in 2014 of a cocaine poisoning in a vehicle.
The case sparked national attention after Carter’s text messages revealed that she had encouraged him to end his life.
"Hush up, spring from a building, first you yourself, I don't know, there are many ways," she said in several messages she had sent in the two weeks before his death while he was with his family in Greece.
"In the midst of his suicide, Conrad wrote: "You have to do it, Conrad" and "All you have to do is turn off the generator and you will be free and happy."
The Monarch said that Carter was seeking attention by the death of Roy and ordered that she should be benefited by any press coverage of the case.
The case has shared the legal opinion.
The few who defended Carter included Amanda Knox, who was sentenced in 2007 for murdering her British cousin in Italy, before being released two years later.
The Knox, 30, posted in the Los Angeles Times a comment: "Michelle Carter deserves compassion and help, not arrest."
The Kimmich: Learning from the new mini-Lacey of the FC
The fact that Joshua Kimmich appeared at the Audi Cup as the captain is no surprise.
I'm tracing the Confederate Cup to a big season - extra motivation doesn't hurt there.
It was there differently on his spot in the cabin, which saw Joshua Kimmich immediately, even though the extra clothing was very, very small.
If there was far and away at the second day of the Audi Cup obviously no Philip Lahm and even no Manuel Neuer to be seen, he made sure to get the him tossed bit at the arm.
"The coach hasn't announced it," the Confederate champion told reporters behind the scenes, after his first appearance as a Rangers captain.
I, the Eint would have run better than 0-0 against the SSC Neapel.
The sign of the coach could have been Kimmich too descriptive.
The eight-year-old Arturo Vidal was chosen in the out of juniors, defenceman and just out of the holidays to join the C-League as playmaker, but he.
Thel you may want to distribute to those you care about that you want to keep at Laughter.
If you have also been chosen to attend the event of Lahm, you can use a little extra motivation just fine.
"Mich confirmed: "That's what you want to do as a player: take responsibility".
This past Tuesday, the 22-year-old ran as a mini-lap over the field.
I hint, this is now his position, the white ribbon at the arm did its utmost.
The überhaupt appeared to be Kimmich in this start as the one who can take the Rude as well.
I gave instructions, trying to control the uneasy crowd.
I had the eye for the whole thing while many others were busy with themselves.
In order to overcome his lack of fitness (didn’t seem to); Renato Sanches trying to catch on to the performances of the Asia trip (didn’t even belong); and Sebastian Rudy and Niklas Syle trying to fit in their first performance
I always thought it was going to work quite well.
I ran along with Kimmich, Rudy before the attack, both acting souverantly.
The namically-designed Napoli striker did frequently struggle, while Scully was also trying to be successful in the play-offs a few times.
The colleague Rudy admitted that the result was "not as we hoped".
I also saw him show off a solid performance.
Iverson, Tempo change: "For this style I was picked up too."
The ungewist nature of this FCW still exists for the newcomers, you saw in the aftermath of the game.
They for example did not give in the catacombs a or two, but determined six or seven interviews.
Imich resigned after a few knee-jerk statements in front of his newcomers.
I heard of Syle saying an interesting thing: "What's going on here, I've already noticed.
"You just have to win every game".
I suppose that he has to teach the new one.
I'm motivated by ÖFB-Dames
The Al-Qaeda believes in the success of our Osama Bin Laden
Its most well-known footballer has tweeted about the game on Twitter and wished the ÖFB Dames all the best.
I think the Bayern-leader is kind of club-mate of ÖFB captain Schnaderbeck and hangs around with our ladies.
The Tweet of the Irish footballer of the year and Champions League winner should be a special motivational factor.
This famous Bayern dude might need our ladies as well.
I'm satisfied with rhetoric: Economy loudest Wissing's pace
It was often unclear how the relationship between the state and regional economies would have developed when Evelyn Lemke (Governor) was still economic minister of Rhode Island.
This is after more than a year since the new economic minister Paul Wiggins (UKIP) has been in office.
The ministers and companies from the region speak on T V's call for a change in economic policy - and tapping simultaneously the old minister.
"Natus, chairman of the Vereinigung Trier Unternehmen, says: "Wissing greives into the wishes of the economy, which has blocked Lemke all the way."
This is the biggest knack Natus has seen in infrastructure: The LNG line 1 between Kelburn and Adenauer is now placed in the priority list of the state now.
In this year’s budget, the ministry hopes to have a plan, by 2021, the building code should be put in place.
The role in the plans of the state also plays the Westumberland Railway Station, which is in front of the need of the federal transportation plan.
The plan is to take the train in December 2020, says Ministerial Vice-Chancellor Cornelia Holtman.
Itus sieht it as a way to support regional, but internationally competitive companies.
The Industrial Chamber of Trier is seeking, as from Wissing, to introduce at the winery a Rheinland-Pfalz label to increase sales in supermarkets and stop the trend of declining German wine exports.
If Wissing has an open mind for people who want to start a business, the Ivy League is loving it.
The Handwerkskammer Trier sees in the new Meister Bonus an added incentive for young graduates, says CEO Matthias Schwalbach.
In addition, a scholarship of $1000 for the completion of the master's degree and $2000 if students become self-employed within ten years after the master's degree.
The housework list for the country remains long.
The proposed road construction would be quick to make facts, to the extent that it would fail to provide the country with needed personnel, says Jan Glockauer, chief executive of the Iowa City Chamber of Commerce.
The 56 new engineers Wissing wants to hire at the Department of Mobility are yet to fill 29 positions.
The IRS calls for more appointments to internal offices.
The Conservative candidate, Chris Baldwin, points to figures from the Rechnungshof that the state spent more than $20 million less in the restoration of state-owned roads than previously estimated.
The Navajo Nation also expects a plan of the state to address the skills shortage in the region.
I agree with you fervently about the current Breitbart-based infrastructure in the country.
This year, regional companies had assessed the network in a IHS survey only with a grade of 3,4.
I've been experiencing slow internet speeds and a lot of awkwardness.
It's worth noting that Vice-Chairman Evelyn Lemke is currently out of politics and is still in charge of the board of the wind power company Pro Wind.
The Republican candidate left the House in April to become president of a private college in Kansas City - where she resigned after four months of uncertainty had already cleared the field.
It will change 800,000 diesel cars - carmakers see a counter-clockback
The day before the announcement by Audi, BMW said it would offer to update the software in more than 33,000 vehicles.
The BMW chief executive said the company is concerned that "there are intelligenter options than driving restrictions," and referred to European cities - including Milan, where BMW operates - to ban diesel vehicles or eliminate them.
The Mercedes-Benz Group announced Tuesday that it will modifie three million Mercedes-Benz cars in Europe to reduce its diesel emissions.
The company disclosed the undertakings as a return call.
The Automobile Industry has encouraged the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to support the enforcement of rules for CO2 emissions.
The carbon monoxide emitted by diesel engines are known to be carcinogenic and can cause asthma.
The cost for the automobile manufacturers to install systems to remove the from diesel vehicles emitted exhaust gases also takes a toll, which makes it difficult to keep the price of cars competitive.
The American Prime Minister, Donald Trump, is also accused of ignoring the powerful automakers and ignoring signs of the problem.
The company is trying to avoid the mistakes made by Volkswagen, which used sophisticated sensors that regulated emission levels to comply with the regulations when a car was tested, but at normal driving conditions.
The United States has arrested several officers of Volkswagen, others are being investigated on both sides of the Atlantic.
This past month, the former head of thermodynamics in the engine development of Volkswagen in Germany was arrested.
The former manager, Zaccheo Giovanni Pamio, is Italian and is therefore not protected from arrest and could be brought to trial in the United States.
“This year, Audi was included in German criminal investigations at Volkswagen after the authorities accused Audi of having installed a system to comply with the emission standards in Europe, and a request that focused on the United States was made,” he said.
The involvement of Audi in the investigation could make Volkswagen vulnerable: The luxury car manufacturer contributes over $1.5 billion to Volkswagen’s profits.
The message has led to the float on Saturday on the Isle of
The city wants to protect the Isle of Man.
If you also want to join the Isle of Man crowd, on Saturday, a float will be flown through Chicago that has a special message.
I'm going to see it again at the Isle of Man, who will see there between Flanagan Bridge and Reichenbach Bridge a big float.
I don't think that's a regular float, with Isar-tourists.
The builder wants to clarify on the matter.
The float looks like a big infographic.
The map shows a mine field.
This is the start of a public campaign to appeal to the Isle of Man visitors.
The theme "Way Love is..." aims to spark awareness of the Isle of Man as a protected wildlife habitat.
The last summer the float crossed the Isle of Man and even in this year there are more actions and measures to promote a responsible and environmentally friendly lifestyle.
The distorted bones and the laughter against the suffering
It was considered to be one of the most recognizable cartoonists, the bonenails of his characters are his signature.
The 85-year-old is still drawing and working on a film.
" His message: Laughter, "for there is too much suffering in the world".
Isidoro Mordillo was born on August 4, 1932 as a son of Spanish immigrants in Buenos Aires.
The first few years as a graphic designer, he spent working as a sketch artist for Happy Birthday cards - which frustrated him.
"The most happy day in my professional life was the day I lost in my job," he once said.
The Stations in Lima, New Orleans, and Paris proved to be his breakthrough: with the publication of his cartoons in "Paris Match" and then in "Saturday Night Live" and other leading magazines around the world.
In China, Mordillo found many fans.
I continue to find the artist inspired by cities.
It's rounded Mordillo's sculptures tucked into Zeppelin's sculptures with the spiral staircase of Pisa, Big Ben in London and the Red Square in Moscow.
The early morning he sits, according to his own accounts, even today at the signage table, working almost ten hours a day.
The calendars, puzzles, books for kids, t-shirts, pocket watches and watches find its dwarves still a lot of popularity across the globe.
The six-year-old has acted in a comic book and a TV series with his characters.
The main character in "Crazy Island" is a giraffe - Mohatu's most popular animal in its illustrations - who has a taut face as a counterpart.
I've never heard his characters speak in the 3D movie that's due to come out next year.
"I don't know exactly what they're going to say, it's strange for me," says Mordillo.
The script is not written by him.
I prefer to focus on the TV show, which is, like its originals, wordless produced.
Ivendel from the Provence is threatened by climate change
It has become a symbol of Provence in southern France, but there is a warning that it is vulnerable to climate change.
The lawn is deteriorating because of the ancient conditions and because of disease-causing insects, which scientists and farmers who are trying to find solutions are facing great headaches.
The Chaisse, expert of the Agricultural Research Institute CRIEPPAM in Provence, said: "The lawn in the Provence is effectively threatened because the plant has suffered in recent years from the effects of climate change, which has caused in the spring much less rainfall than in the summer
I have an impact on the longevity of Lavendel.
"There is also a small bacteria, a microorganism that transmits zika, and at very hot weather there are very few of them."
I'm sure there's much on the line.
Thevendel oil is not just for vacationers, it is also used for perfume and cosmetics.
The Chaisse said: "In order to have very long plants with a large number of flowers, we have smaller, underlying and either missing or damaged plants.
"We have fewer parts with olive oil."
The solutions in mind are a better water distribution and the reduction of evaporation from the ground, but also the treatment of the plants with a protective mixture of tongue and water and the development of cultivars that are more tolerant to dry conditions.
The slum of Geisa in the northern Rovaniemi celebrates its 1200th anniversary this year.
The height of the festival is this Saturday and Sunday with a medieval festival.
Immigration, trains, shops, vacant buildings or a landscaping will be seen at these times in the city.
The murder of a journalist underscores the growing threat in Mexico
The staff of the weekly newspaper Riodoce typically meet with reporters to review their plans for reporting on the recent chaos in the state of Sinaloa by the organized crime,corruption and unlawful drug trafficking.
The next day, in the shadow of their own tragedy, they came together to talk about safety.
I was told that it is important to change their routines.
The high-profile journalist discusses what feels more safe: They should take their children with them to the office, which was the target of an attack with Granite, or let them stay home.
The experts have written three words on a table at the front of the room: Attackers, Neutrals, Survivors.
I ask the reporters to suggest names for each column - no evidence is needed, guesswork and brainwaves suffice.
The drug traffickers, politicians, businessmen, journalists, who are suspected to be on the payroll of the government or the carnival, are a catalog of criminals that make the chaos of Mexico dangerous.
I don’t have a pause from the violence, and while in the whole country the dead are getting heavier, more journalists are involved: at least 25, since President Enrique Peña Nieto took office in 2012. 589 are standing up after attacks and threats under federal law.
The last one is her creator and her inspiration from Rio de Janeiro, the founder Juan Antonio Cardenas.
"The biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and be a journalist," wrote Valdez in one of his numerous books on violence involving drugs.
Ignorance is deeply felt, though his presence is everywhere - a large photo of Valdez showing his middle finger with the word "Justice" hanging at the facade of the Rio de Janeiro General Hospital. Two reporters in the three-quarters of the 1970s and early 1980s
The workshop takes place less than two months after his death, and the reporters discuss their shared issues, the trauma, their Alpt experiences, sleeplessness, paranoia.
It was 2010 that a special prosecutorship was established to investigate the cases of journalists, which according to the Committee for the Protection of Journalists only filed two criminal charges.
The vast majority of suicides each year are linked to drug trafficking and organized crime, but the murders of journalists are only rarely prosecuted.
The Riodoce continue to insist on treating the violence of Sinaloa, though they are uncertain and although the Terrace is now more secret.
The information about the murderers, without justice, has made the meeting to discuss security little use, says Ibarra.
"It is very dull to waste my time in this workshop," he says.
"So long as we don't know the Why, we miss everyone."
The morning of the 15th, Valdez left the office of the newspaper Riodoce in the town of Culiacan.
I only managed to drive a few blocks far before my red Toyota Corolla was attacked by two men. He was pulled out of his car and 12 times fired on it, probably because of the name of the newspaper - the one with "Zero Chance".
The gunman drove in his car away and killed it in the process.
Iz was 50 years old.
I left behind a wife and two elderly children.
The rumors neighbourhood of Culiacan is free to flee.
The issue of Valdez is practically nothing but silence.
In Guzman's arrest last year and the release in the United States in January, Sinaloa has become one of the most blunt battlefields of the country as rival factions fight here to fill the void.
It doesn’t make sense that in Sinaloa every day someone or two people are killed on the street or that the graveyard is full of empty, two-story mausoleums for drug lords, which are bigger than many houses for the dead.
I remember for a minute that there is a state of "Rule" when only a map has the control over the coastal state with its valuable ports and drug trafficking routes into the United States.
This and despite the fact that Valdez was aware of the dangers of his work, is Ismail Bojorquez (60), a co-founder and director of Riodoce, with the regret that he could not protect his friend.
I believe that two misconceptions have contributed to the murder.
It was in February that there was an interview with Damaso Lopez, a leader of one of the rival clans in the war with Guzman’s sons.
The closure may have hurt the sons, presumably Gang members bought each copy of the magazine on the day it was delivered to newspaperskioske.
The second mistake was not to allow Valdez to leave the country after the arrest of another newspaper that had published the same story, leaving the country to its own safety.
Ifz was a legend in Mexico and elsewhere, and his death is regarded as a milestone in the Mexican violence against journalists.
I had lived so long that his friends and colleagues assumed that he would always be there.
I was 2003 an experienced reporter for Noroeste when I teamed up with five colleagues to start Riodoce and sell 50 percent of the company.
"In Sinaloa, it was impossible to run journalism without touching on the drug problem," Bojoquez said.
The newspaper earned a reputation for its muttering and honest reporting, and the revenue and advertising took over.
I loved being able to publish hard-hitting investigations without fear of plagiarism, and the readers were fascinated by a publication where they could read stories that no one else could treat.
The years after the founding of Rio de Janeiro, she received the prestigious "Maria Moormoor Cayo Award" for her reporting in Latin America.
The same year, Valdez won the 'International Press Freedom Award' of the Committee for the Protection of Journalists for his courage in defending the Mexican drug history, wherever it led.
I gave up voluntarily that he had fear.
"I want to continue," he said to the time of the CPJ award.
The drug trade in Sinaloa "is a lifestyle," he said in October in an interview with Rompevia TV.
It's up to you to take on the task that you feel is most important to you as a journalist - either that or you play the dumb.
"What did you do at the sight of so many dead... why didn't you say what was going on?"
This Riodoce team misses Valdez, the funvogel who could flush like a prisoner, the friend who was generous with hugs and prayers, a teacher who knew how to survive.
I trusted on his routine.
I would always wear my hat.
I would always go to El Guayabo, the bar opposite from the office, and sit there always at the same table.
I ask them: Was his love for Rousseau his fate?
The death also forced her to question her own assumptions about how she can best perform her job and stay alive.
I don't like it when you're working with their women, their children, their clean shops, their local start-up and landfills, to move cocaine.
"These things weren't allowed to happen," Bojorquez said.
The result is, even in the best of times, a high level of self-discipline and self-control.
I trust my own instincts.
In case it smells wrong, stay away from it.
"It's frustrating," said the hermit of Rio de Janeiro Andres Villarreal, that "Gerardo has a sense of humor that can be fooled... and then the thing with Javier is happening."
The old rules, as he and others say, don't apply in Sinaloa anymore - as well as in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states, in which a gifted mixture of lusterous slavery routes, poor institutions and corrosive regimes
The landscape changes constantly.
In the room where the staff of Riodoce attended security training were suddenly no cell phones allowed. Days ago, it was revealed that spyware, which is sold exclusively to governments, was used to spy on journalists and activists in Mexico.
I sucked two cops protection from the heat of 104 degrees (40 degrees) in the shadow of a tree.
I was asked to protect the offices of Riodoce in a four-story building in a middle-class suburb of Culiacan.
I inhaled, asking some of the reporters if these officers were to the 50 percent of the police, which the governor himself described as not trustworthy.
This is months since the reporters have been in the mountains where the drug gangs are de facto under control.
The issue of this week has Riodoce on three main stories.
It was the death of the brother of the former legendary boxer Julio Cesar Chavez in Sinaloa.
I also had an excerpt to the State Budget that focused on the hometown of the Governor.
It was a group who broke into one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan, a block from the office of the prosecutor.
I didn’t have an official word on who was kidnapped or how it happened, so precaution was taken when it was time to write what everyone in the city knows: that the restaurant is a favorite of drug dealers and authorities.
The reporter learned from public surveillance that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politician who is affiliated with the Republican Institutional Revolution Party (PRI), which dominated almost the whole century all political levels.
It has been reported that several PRI officials have been arrested for high-profile cases of fraud.
Ireal asked the reporter to write about previous incidents in this pub, including one in which a son of "El Chapo" Guzman died a military overdose.
The few months earlier, the readers would have regarded the column of Valdez as the most informed source about the kidnapping.
"Finally, we'd already known what happened," said Villarreal, 46, with the nickname "El Flaco" because of his thin body.
"Now all the channels of communication with our sources have been destroyed."
The office of Valdez has been converted to a storage area for signs and posters protesting the murder of journalists, because the staff have become something they themselves never expected: activists in the name of the press.
In the meantime, Miriam Ramirez threw up a few signs and went to a demonstration for a second reporter to the office of the prosecutor.
The Adame disappeared three days after Valdez was killed, in the northern state of Michoacan.
The burnt body was found and authorities say based on DNA testimony that it is his.
The whole country's journalists are becoming loudest, by writing in organized protests "SOS Press" on walkways and buildings.
The filmmaker Bolhão is away from Washington and is trying to collect international support for the trial in the case of Valdez.
In a meeting with the governor of Sinaloa on the day of the assassination, Ramirez accused the authorities of kidnapping journalists and putting them to death because they have said the truth.
I have since been asked to be re-appointed by the government because I am concerned that her wrath has damaged my objectivity.
Iz had repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico were exposed to organized crime, involved government officials and a same-sex society.
In his last book, "Narco-Journalism," he wrote that reporters are not only killed by drug traffickers, but also on the orders of politicians and security forces who were involved with the organized crime under a cover.
The media whistleblower group "Articulo 19" has identified more than half of the attacks on journalists of police and prosecutors to be illegal.
"In Mexico, you die because they want you to keep the mouth shut," Ramirez said.
I suspect the murders have an abhorrent effect.
I remember the death of blogger Maria Elizabeth Macias in northern Mexico six years ago.
"The body was found along with a note that was supposed to be signed by the Zetas-cartel: "His Majesty, I am sorry for my reports."
The computer and headphones were next to her abdomen.
The Filiales have chosen to close, as the newspaper El Norte in the northern province of Chihuahua after the murder of Corinne Breach in March.
I continue to do as El Manana of Nuevo Laredo did after the assassination of her director in 2004.
I responded to the Diario de Ciudad Juarez publicly with a Leitmotif on the front page with the phrase "What do you want from us?"
The journalists are from their home countries or even from the country.
The decision is a bitter one.
It is hard to find work in exile, and they still watch the streets and look for danger.

Iosaurus used Tartarus to fight his enemies
In the first place it looks like a statue, if not an embarrassing one.
The researchers have found that the first findings of the amazing skeleton of a Canadian alpinist were so well preserved that experts have described it as "Mona Lisa of the Dinosaurs".
I was so well preserved that they even noticed that his shaved skin was of pale brown - and they said it had something of an "unsettled past."
The report in the journal "Current Biology" described him as "the best fossilized dinosaur ever found, and one of the best fossilized dinosaurs of the world".
The fossil is a newly discovered species of nodosaurian that lived in the middle of the Kreide age between 110 and 112 million years ago.
In its incredibly well preserved condition, researchers who describe it as "real beast" are shocked
The report in National Geographic is that the fossilized plant is the best preserved fossil of its kind.
I was found by Shawn Funk on March 21st, 2011 in the Suncor Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in northern Alberta, Canada.
I traf on something that seemed to be feathered feathers, and decided to look closer.
The of his discovery was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology.
I spent the next six years trying to locate the wildebeest creature within the 2.500 pound (1.100 lbs) of it.
The result of all this hard work is now ready to be revealed.
"If you look just a little closer with your eyes, you could almost believe it was sleeping," said the main author Caleb Brown, researcher at Royal Tyrrell Museum, where the creature is to be seen.
"It will be included in the science fiction as one of the most beautiful and atmospheric dinosaur fossils - the Mona Lisa of the Dinosaurs."
The researchers have found that this plant creature, although it is covered with a coat and looks like a walking panther, was likely attacked by flesh eaten dinosaurs.
I strongly believe that the Dinosaur used a red and white tar to protect itself from rabies, and used an abbreviated technique known as counter-terrorism, which is also used by many modern animals.
This would have allowed it to blend better into its surroundings and avoid its foes, say experts, which suggests it was attacked by larger dinosaurs.
The 110-million-year-old creature from the family of Nodosaurians has made headlines in May and is now at Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology.
The researchers have now studied the wildebeest creature and it has been called Borealopelta markmitchelli after the museum engineer Mark Mitchell, one of a team that spent more than 7,000 hours investigating it carefully.
The preservation of the specimen enabled Dr. Mitchell and a multidisciplinary team of researchers to document the pattern and form of claws and rifles on its body.
I discovered the colony defense, a common defense method in the animal kingdom, which means that the top of the creature was darker than its underside.
This is where the constraint is common, as the results are surprising as the size of Borealopelta exceeds at least the size of the today living animals.
It denotes that the dinosaurs were hunted by enough pressure by flesh eaten dinosaurs that the Evolution enabled the spread of conquest as a means of survival.
The most zeitgeist animals that use the condom - think of reptiles, zebras or gorillas - are much smaller and more vulnerable than beasts, which signals that this nodosaurian is going to have a real battle to survive.
"Starry-eyed raptors on a massive, strongly clawed dinosaurs show how dangerous the dinosaurs must have been of the Kreide Age," Brown said.
The chemical analysis of organs in their scales also revealed that the skin of the dinosaur was red.
I continue to investigate the animal on evidence of its life, including its preserved bones, to determine what it has eaten as its last meal.
I believe the dinosaur, when he died, sank into a river and sank into the ocean, where he sank on the bottom to the sea floor.
I remember this time Alberta was as warm as South Florida is today, and rivers and oceans were likely much further north than they are today.
"The nodosaurier is truly distinctive because it is fully covered with preserved skin, but also remains in three dimensions and retains the original shape of the animal," Brown said.
The result is that the animal nowadays looks almost identical to that of the early bronze age.
"You don't need much imagination to recreate it. If you just look with your eyes, you could almost believe that he's sleeping."
The Kreide Age was a time when gigantic dinosaurs, flew on two legs, ran through the Earth.
The King of them, the Tyrannosaurus Rex, lived millions of years after Borealopelt lived, the fierce dinosaur was hunted by some of its furry predecessors.
This is the Acrocanthosaurus, a 38 foot (11.5 m) tall, six-foot-tall monster.
The scientists whose latest findings appear in the journal Current Biology believe that Borealopelta died after the death in the ocean and was mutilated.
The creature was found by Shawn Funk on March 21st, 2011 in the Suncor Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in northern Alberta, Canada.
In the museum, it is the best-preserved skeleton of the world, including skin and coat, and is completely covered from the skull to the shoulder.
The creatures were in average about 18 feet (5 meters) long and carried up to 3,000 pounds (1.300 kg).
It encompassed two 20-foot-long Spitzes that ran from its shoulders.
The researchers believe that the grey plant was carried through the west coast of Canada until an overgrown lake flooded it into the open sea.
The underwater body of the dinosaur was preserved in exquisite detail.
The hidden remains of this particular specimen are so well preserved that the bones still retain holistic pants along the bones
If Michael Greshko wrote for National Geographic, a such level of preservation is as'seltered' as a win in the Lotto.
The more I look at it, the more confusing it becomes.
The boneless remains of the skin still cover the holistic pants that carry the skull of the animal.

Ignition: Masses of smoke on A8: Many dead
It happened on Thursday afternoon on the A8: More than 30 vehicles are involved in a mass collision.
I've seen numerous victims, kilometers - and gasses.
This morning, on the Autobahn in Stuttgart, about 20 people have been killed in a collision.
The first reports said at about 17.00 a.m. between the intersection of Adelsheim and Omaha (Land of Amish) were about 30 vehicles, including likely trucks, injuring themselves.
The exact number of deaths were initially unknown.
I handled minor to moderate injuries, said a police spokesman.
The large number of ambulances were at the scene.
The A8 was completely blocked.
If you were driving north, you would form a roughly ten mile long back-country.
If a AZ reporter reports, it also came to a halt on the roadway to massive delays - by numerous gators.
The fire department notified the drivers of the vehicles, who now face emptied fines.
The aftermath of the collision caused another accident on the A8, this time between Atlanta and Dasing.
I was involved in a collision between a car and a truck.
The ambulance was on its way to the scene.
"British Railway": Konzern testet "Comfort Check-in"
This is a moment that almost everyone has experienced: Not a minute ago you sat in the train and slept.
The man is deeply invested in his work and has just come up with a brilliant thought.
The next thing you know: puffy.
I'm going to the chase and weigh a unknown or pull the driver mittens out of the workflow.
The cardholder's control.
The days of undertakings are soon to be over.
The Royal Air Force is currently testing the controversial Fahrenheit Control system.
It just confirms via phone that you have taken your place and entitles you to the ride.
I'm running a test run on two tracks.
I'm sorry for the offer, far from it.
"It will then be available beginning next year on many other train lines in the UK," said a Railway spokesman.
"Comfort check-in" the train calls for the ride-sharing process without cheating.
If you want to use the app, however, you must meet some requirements: You need a smartphone or tablet.
This requires you to book an online ticket - which without doubt already do most riders.
It also requires you to purchase it via the app of the train, the DB Navigator, which is probably the most convenient way to buy tickets.
The last thing you need is a seat reservation.
The "comfort check-in" process works as follows: You step into the train, call your ticket under "My Tickets".
The test customer will then see a button to electronically enter the data.
The train passengers get on their mobile devices a notification that passenger X is in the train and has taken the reserved seat Y.
The train driver at the ticket counter at Place Y knows that there is a passenger with already enrolled online ticket.
I can also continue to sleep, continue to work, continue to cry.
The "check-in" has two benefits: one for the customer, one for the train company - which again will benefit the passengers.
If you want to travel relaxed without ticket control by our trainees, check in the DB Navigator just yourself.
"It allows riders to personalize their journey in the train," says Michael Peterson, marketing director of DB Fernbush.
"And our staff have more time than today to focus on the individual needs of our customers."
If you often travel train, you know that along with delays and missed trains, the ticket controls are among the most annoying.
I often have myself, in any case but one of the fellow travelers, not all the documents you need to retrieve online tickets.
It may be missing the credit card or the Personal Identification Number or otherwise a document you need to show.
The result is endless discussion between train driver and passenger, which leads to bad mood in the elevator or large room and delays in controlling the own ticket and giving the skipper at the end the time to take care of other concerns.
It can only be used by a small number of test customers to use the new service.
The same is also true on the lines 915 Dortmund-Stuttgart and 912 Stuttgart-Essen.
The train numbers on the same line are yet to be released.
"How did an activist come to learn the answer to the question: "Whose Streets?"
The 9th of August 2014, Brittany Ferrell was burnt to her core.
The next day, when she arrived in New York City, the in St. Louis-on-the-Lake girl sat on the bed of an Airbnb apartment she rented and scrolled through Facebook on her phone.
I stumbled across a post from someone from the high school.
"The police just killed an 18-year-old boy, and it is still lying on the street," said there.
Ignoring that no one else had posted on their feed the information, she closed Facebook and opened Twitter.
The user with the handle @TheePharoah was constantly retweeted on their timeline.
The rapper from the area of St. Louis was watching the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed black 18-year-old who was shot by a white cop in Ferguson, Mo., live.
I posted a picture of Brown's leaking body, which was placed on the street and would stay there four hours.
"That's wild," Ferrell thought at once.
The death was for her and her community nothing new.
I left my phone to later that evening to tweet about people on the Cannon Drive.
"There were photos of the police band and people who shouted, and of a man claiming to be Brown's father who wore a helmet with the message: "Ferguson police just killed my uncle!"
I observed a live feed where a police officer stood before a group of demonstrators with a bell-shaped dog.
"In another video, she said, ensconced another officer's gun and shouted: "I'll kill you... animals all."
"That's not common," recalled Ferrell of her statement.
"That's not the kind of murder we've become accustomed to and that we can call typographic."
In this moment, I felt shaken.
"He was whispering and weighed in."
I booked a return flight and went home the next day.
In the latter part of the night, she took her 6-year-old daughter out of the house of her father and agreed that the two would drive to Ferguson.
“What happened in the following three years with Ferrell and Ferguson,” is the subject of a new documentary, "While Streets?", set to premiere in the U.S. on Nov. 11.
This is a story of survival and protest, of love and despair, of strength and resistance that exists from the perspective of people who live in the community and have filled the streets asking for answers.
This morning Ferrell with her daughter, who wore a floral dress and a matching crown, drove to Ferguson, beating the two a conversation they had unfolded before this morning »about the black experience and the black condition.
"You remember how I taught you when black people have to fight for that which they believe?" she remembered.
I'm going now to Ferguson because the police killed an 18-year-old boy and that wasn't right.
"I could not take her with me," Ferrell said later.
I think what happened today is a culmination of what... happened in the past.
I have to know it and see it and draw it on.
This must be well developed, not just activism and organization, but understanding the different layers of black experience and the black constitution and what we must do to be free to be ourselves.
The more I have the privilege of giving her an experience where she personally doesn’t experience any egregious discrimination, the more she is not different from the next black woman.
"I have the feeling I would render her a bad service, keeping her away from me."
The first stop they made in Ferguson was at South Florissant Road, a place near the police station that was converted to a camp as the activists waited for the potential non-disclosure of Officer Darren Wilson.
I have known Ferrell and her daughter with a local businessman who made lunch.
I berefted myself of pockets and helped to pass them to demonstrators.
I began a new kind of activism for Ferrell Gestalt.
"My activism has radically changed after the 9th," she said and recalled that she was a student at the University of Missouri-St. Louis president of the Minority Student Nursing Association and focused on food justice and reducing poverty in black communities.
I had no experience in organising.
"All is come to pass."
I later met Ferrell during an evening demonstration with Sabaah Folayan, one of the co-creators of the film.
Ilayan said she and her cameraman Lucas Alvarado-Farrar were just trying to "document" what happened.
The question came Ferrell in mind: "Would you document or try to find a story you can use?"
The skepticism was fueled by untold cases of people being abused, often by white people - in a community that profited from their pain and their resistance.
"Folayan recently said in an interview: "We had heard that people who were born and raised in Ferguson didn't have their voices centered and we wanted to do it differently."
Ilayan had previously worked with the former co-star Damon Davis, a artist from the area known for his activism rumours rumours rumours rumours rumours rumours rumours rumours rumours rumours rumours.
The commitment brought Ferrell closer to the project, along with six other immigrants following the team of "Who's Streets?" in the years following Brown's arrest.
"This documentary is not someone who speaks for us or talks with us. We talk," Davis said.
"That was the main thing for me to see how these people are portrayed, because so I will be portrayed."
"The goal was not to focus on Ferrell's experience - to show that there is attraction to the movement "not a Messiah flag, but a community that comes together," Folayan said - she emerged as the most open-minded participant.
The follow-up to "Whose Streets?" reveals surprisingly personal aspects of Ferrell's life as she marries and marries her wife.
"I felt like naked," Ferrell said and laughed as she saw the finished product for the first time.
"After all, I have understood that there must be at this work and at the abuse of black people a certain cruelty."
In addition, Ferrell’s story revisits the role of black women in the broader Black Lives Matter movement.
The three founders of the movement, who after the murder of the black teen Trayvon Martin in 2012 sparked the film "Black Lives Matter" in social media, identify as black.
"Black, white women in leadership positions have shaped the movement overall," Ferrell said, "and so we constantly fight at different fronts.
"White, black women must bear the burden of everything."
Ilayan agreed, saying that "the movement is really being held by black women and many black women on a daily basis".
It is assumed that "this is not an affirmative type of action," when Ferrell was chosen because of her identity as the heart of the film.
"She was the person who burned this energy on her," she said.
This is no surprise, though she was at the front because at one life at these crossroads as a black, white woman so much on the line.
"You can feel their energy through the screen."
The news cameras in Ferguson have long faded, but the rascal links between the community and the police continue to exist.
Yourell is on bail for 21⁄2 years for blocking a road at a demonstration.
It describes the societal atmosphere of the place she calls home: "A Chaos".
I klank at a choir and she feels this choir belongs to her since she spent three years in Ferguson on the streets.
It is our obligation to fight for our freedom.
I am our obligation to win.
I have to love and support each other.
"We have nothing to lose - except our chains."
"Trainspotting" to "Greatest Worst": TV viewers debate about Bit-Gallery
The Bit Gallery moves the people, though it hasn’t been built yet.
The idea of a shopping mall at the south end of the pedestrian crossing has divided the community since its first presentation in 2009.
This leaves the subject barely a mystery.
It's on our Facebook page "Volunteer Bitburg" that the issue is discussed.
"The one to the Bit Gallery: "That would be a dream" (Anja Becker) or "That would be really great" (Nicole Schausten), comes from the other side: "Brave no man" (Siggi Betzen) or quite simply: "Get up and
In the hopes that a gallerie will attract more customers to the city, whereas the rest of the shops will benefit, the opposition fears that then the pedestrian zone will collapse.
The Gallery will be located right on the property where the Farmers Market Hall is located, where 13 direct-to-consumer farmers will be able to sell their products.
The start of construction will be concluded with that.
The galleries are hoping to integrate a market hall into the new building - and of course to the Beda space with room to sit outside.
The Zimmerman: "We've been buying almost weekly in the farmers market hall.
In addition to our eggnogs, but also the yummy cakes of the landlords always enjoy them very much.
The meth has been discovered for us.
I would hope that even during and before the construction of the galleries there is a chance to maintain this offer.
I've seen other cities do that too.
"All the small market hall in Frankfurt is interesting."
Id Densing: "Obviously, having direct sales in a market hall in the galleries comes down to the cost of rent.
"Well, at that new project, it probably won't be just low."
The Kilic: "Where are shopping malls in Bitch?
It's clothes, shoes, drugstore or grocery stores: I don't think that's overrated.
I've seen plenty of them in our city.
I see how many stores here are empty - some for months and years.
I don't think there is here yet a proper weekly market, so it's important that we at least retain the market hall.
I always find that the local produce is fresh, is mostly direct from the producer and is obscenely priced.
This way you can see that stores in a shopping mall are only rented by larger companies, because the local rents are often not worth it for a single storey mall.
"Oh, specialty shops almost no longer exist and what remains of them will then probably be disappeared."
The Fandel: "A shopping mall with a market place doesn't fit for me.
I don't think the galleries fit into Bitch's.
The most important thing: Where should the farmers market hall be during construction?
The old Edeka would be the solution - even on a temporary basis, if the BitGallery ever actually comes along.
"Does the creepy Bit-Gallery have any intention of shutting down all the shops out of Bit-Gallery?"
The Marquis: "That will just not work.
I don't need a shopping mall that is empty either.
I think it would have been better to promote a proper farmers market rather than this galleries.
I forgot to mention that for a farmer's market hall, there is no place left thanks to the waht-like many - as far as I'm concerned - sinnless construction projects in Bitburg.
"When the farmer's market hall is burnt down again, a piece of culture will disappear."
The perfect match: Artist creates portraits with Chelsea Manning DNA
In the corner of the Fridman Gallery in New York City are many faces to be seen - white, black and brown, which seem almost identical - that hang at cables from the ceiling.
The 30 portraits were created by the artist Heather Dewey-Haggerty from curls and haircuts that were sent to her by Chelsea Manning.
Inning sniffed the extracts from Fort Leavenworth, where the former CIA analyst was sentenced to a 35-year prison sentence after she disclosed secret diplomatic messages via the website WikiLeaks.
The new exhibition, which opened on August 2, is called A Becoming Resemblance (An appropriate resemblance).
“This is the product of two years of co-operation between Dewey Hawke, whose disability combined her expertise in technology, computer science and art, and Manning, a transgender and away-from-home disability, whose arrest by Barack Obama
Iwey-Hagborg has created through the algorithmic analysis of DNA that was extracted from Manning and from the 30 portraits created as to how someone could look with these genomic data, a sharp, if slightly iffy comment not only to the form of the genomic data but
Inning, who was born as Bradley Edwards, but has been open about her identity as a woman since 2013, was charged with 20 charges, including six violations of the spying law, computer fraud and theft.
In the prison, her image was undermined so much that there was only one photo - a dark, black selfie, in which Manning looks uncomfortable on a driver's seat and wears a platinum pearl necklace.
The year 2015 Dewey-Hagborg came just from the great success of her 2012-project 'Strange Visions'.
The artist produced portraits of foreigners from forged artefacts like cigarette smoke and cocaine, using the DNA from the trash to create a picture of how these people might look.
This was the moment she received an email from a newspaper.
"She conducted an interview with Chelsea Manning while she was in jail, and they wanted a kind of portrait to support this article," Dewey-Hagborg explained at a press conference of the new exhibition.
I didn’t see Chelsea to this day and she couldn’t be photographed, so I took contact with Chelsea and asked if she wanted to do a DNA profile.
The artist and her infamous Muse became unofficial letter friends who exchanged in the course of two years several letters.
The sculpture even included a by Shooley Kanungo illustrated comic "Suppressed Images", which predicted a future in which the president would change Chelsea's ruling and she would be in a position to see the exhibition personally.
The fact that Obama actually only a few days after the book was published would demand Manning’s release after seven brutal years in a military prison in Kansas City was a welcomed kind of happy reunion.
In fact, there is also now at the opening of the exhibition something deep and starry-eyed as Donald Trump is leading a war against informants from the government camp and against transgender trolls to find new, tweetable ways to address the starry-eyed divide he is supposed
"When Dewey-Hagborg was asked about the strange timing of all these things, she said that "Drugs happen out of a certain reason".
The one on the wall of the galleries' lobby called for Manning with her oversized signature below (the "i" in her family name is with a heart) a stopping of "automatic slavery, whose basis is gender, race, and religion."
The side of the wall is their mitochondrial DNA sequence - a tautogram of Cs and Gs and As, written in Bleach.
Iwey-Hagborg hoped through the incorporation of the 200 words (or Nukleotide after the highly evolved philosophy of the artist) to show how distinctive, at least in biological terms, we all are.
"What people will hopefully take away from this is that our genome doesn't care about who we are and how open genetic data are for interpretation and how subjective they are," said Dewey-Hagborg, whose video clip from 2007, Spurious Memories, also included
"DNA can tell so many different stories, so that's why the 30 of these stories are."
The last piece in the exhibition, which is in a separate room, is a page from the above comic novel.
It shows Manning how she can be reached with a free phone in hand from the displaced Americans of the United States like King Kong.
"If they put your speech cold, then they have won," says it.
"As long as you don't halt the mouth".
"It came straight from a letter she sent me," said the artist, who grew up in Philadelphia.
"I still get giggles when I talk about it."
Inning hasn't been to the exhibition yet - as predicted in the comic book - but if she should, then she'll be greeted in the middle of the room by the masks, of their own genomic simulations, which look like they're going to be
I was also targeted, as was everything in the exhibition, up to the size (5 " 2, Manning Stairs), at which their genetic haplogroups were written with Blemish marks.
"In the past I had them at the wall, but I wanted them to look like a human being," Dewey-Hagborg said of the portraits.
"I wanted it to feel like a mass movement forming with Chelsea, like the movement that was also behind their liberation."
The University of North Carolina and a faculty member of the University of Oxford have been arrested for murder
The nation’s largest human trafficking case is in the works for a professor at North Carolina State University and an assistant professor at the University of Oxford, who are being investigated as suspects after a man was stabbed in a luxury apartment in Chicago with fatal injuries.
This past Monday, for Wyndham Latham (49) and Andrew Warren (56) were sentenced to death for their supposed involvement in the death of Trenton H. James Cornell Davis, according to the records of Cook County Superior Court.
The documents say that Cornell Davis, 26, died after several stabbings.
If the police department of Chicago publishes a collective warning system, the leak was discovered on July 27.
I received a call, came to the Grand Plaza Apartments and found the victim with multiple injuries to his body.
Ill-Duranleau was still at the scene of the crime for dead, and detectives are investigating the stabbing as a suicide while the police are actively looking for the two suspects, said detectives.
Ihem is a doctoral candidate in molecular biology and immunology at North Carolina State University.
I. Cubbage, the Vice-Chancellor for University Relations, said in an email that Latham has now been placed in suspension and has been barred from attending the campus of North Carolina State University.
"This is now a criminal matter that will be investigated by the appropriate authorities, and the North Carolina State University is involved in this investigation," Cubbage said.
I am Senior Treasury Officer at the University of Oxford.
The spokesman for the University and the Somerville College said in an email that "we are in contact with the police in Britain and ready to help the US authorities on any occasion."
The statement added that Warren's colleagues were stunned and wanting him to step up.
The communications officer of the police department of Chicago, Anthony Guglielmi, said, he foresaw the suspects forcing them to put themselves in front of the authorities.
"The police has a vision of their location, and our efforts to locate them are growing," Guglielmi said.
Iglielmi said that local, regional and national authorities are helping to locate the suspects.
Iglielmi said that the police received a call from the building manager of the Grand Palace, who had just received a clue that indicated that in apartment 1008 something had happened.
The police described the scene as very sad.
Iglielmi said it was unclear whether the incident also took place on July 27.
I was told by security cameras that Latham and Warren were in the building.
"We believe that Professor Latham and the victim had a relationship," Guglielmi said.
The management team of Grand Plaza released a statement to the residents: "The police are currently working on the timeline and background of the victim and investigating a variety of motives, including a possible suicide."
"We will conclude the WADA plan in near future" - the Russian Vice-President Mutko
The Russian vice-president Vitaly Mutko said it will not be long before the remaining criteria of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) will be implemented for the restoration of Russia’s anti-corruption system.
In a certain stage of fulfilling the criteria of the Fahrenheit Plan, RUSADA has the right to plan in cooperation with UKAD (UK Anti-Doping Agency).
"The WADA schedule has been updated in this regard," Mutko said on Thursday.
The PM commented on the second part of the Fahrenheit Plan of the WADA to implement the Code of Conduct, which defines the criteria for re-establishment of RUSADA and has recently been published on the website of the organization.
The Mutko contains nothing that could give Russia reason to worry.
A lot has been promised, everything is being implemented.
"The results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and the WADA in near future," he added.
I agree with the in the list listed criteria, however, that the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (Russia Anti-Doping Agency, Russia Anti-Doping Agency, Russia Anti-Doping Agency, Russia Anti-Doping Agency, Russia Anti-Doping Agency, Russia Anti-Do
The matter said Mutko: "We are conducting the investigation as our anti-doping system has made a mistake.
The measures have been implemented.
"There were no government programs, and we will not admit something that doesn't exist."
Ikos words contrasted with those of Vitaly Smirnov, the head of the independent Russian anti-doping agency.
The conversation with the Russian distributor RSport to start the day revealed Smirnov problems of past in Russian anti-doping organizations, adding then: "We have repeatedly said that the report contains umbrella positions and regulations.
"I have no intention of accepting this report," Smirnov added.
IRUSADA was suspended in November 2015 in the wake of the doping scandal by the WADA for the purpose of conducting doping tests in Russia.
I was allowed to plan tests under the supervision of international experts and the UK Anti-Doping Agency (UKADA).
In a visit to the headquarters of the organization in Moscow in July, WADA General Director Olivier Niggli said RUSADA is moving "in the right direction" to be used again.
Idi sells voraciously no eggs anymore
The company’s executives shared with each other.
“This is a pure precautionary measure, it may continue to be of no consequence,” said in the statement.
The soon-to-be delivered eggs to Aldi had been tested positive for fipronil.
The company hopes to create clarity and transparency among its customers.
The Start-Ups that will help your company not become the next Uber
The Errett wanted to measure your staff’s happiness at your e-commerce start-up, but the surveys didn’t work.
I was often vague, little helpful or - even worse - fraudulent.
The even though you promised anonymity, some workers did not trust the process.
"There was just never conviction and objectivity," said Errett, who runs the 75-person San Francisco e-commerce hairdressing company Madison Reed.
I have called people from outside for help.
The new breed of human resources start-ups is at the forefront to help companies figure out how their employees feel.
The creation and license of software that has the specific purpose of measuring employee engagement, it allows companies to conduct surveys, target specific groups and demographic groups, offer employees anonymity and complaints-hours, and provide feedback on their performance.
"You now have tools like Strava and Fitbit for tracking your health, but where is the Fitbit for your company?" asked Jim Barnett, co-founder and chief executive of Redwood City start-up Glint, whose software-based tracking tools are based on
Irett said she gained a better understanding of what your employees think and feel in the three years with Glint.
In addition to the Snap Polls and surveys of certain teams, it also provides a heat map of the company that shows on a screen which units have the most complaints and which managers have low approval scores - so you can go afterbo.
I come to a conclusion that you need to stay at the top of the workplace culture so you don’t become the next Uber that has been caught in scandal since a former employee posted a blog post that describes an environment of intimidation, at which you’re vulnerable.
The start-up like Glint is making this need for an up-to-date list a lush business opportunity.
The Global Governance, Regulation and Compliance sector could have more than $11 billion worth of value by 2020, according to the financial website Let's Talk Payments.
Iverville, Colorado, start-up Converse, which helps companies prevent bad behavior and detect it, saw a surge in interest and activity beginning this year in the Uber fiasco in Mississauga.
The company has almost 600 clients, including Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.
I have been registered as a client.
This glitch, allows Convercent to send companies customized "Polls" surveys, collect anonymous responses in real-time and view the heat maps of your problem areas.
The company also offers an anonymous SMS call with which staff can report bad behavior.
If the principal executive is involved, complaints are directed to the Board of Directors.
"The court of public opinion has caught the Regulators," said Patrick Quinlan, the founder and CEO of Convergence.
If a company is found to treat its employees poorly or be unethical, it may experience costly consequences through consumer boos, employee complaints and lawsuits, Quinlan said.
The Tuesday, the restaurant chain with more than 5,000 employees and over 500 locations, has used Convergence for more than a year to ensure that staff are aware of the policy and procedures and have a simple way to reach their company’s offices.
It used to be that if an employee wanted to report a problem, he or she needed to find a phone number or email address for the company’s customer service department, submit a form of complaint and hope that he or she was taken seriously.
“It was often a humiliating and unpleasant experience,” said James Vitrano, Ruby Tuesday’s General Counsel, who said there was no good way to track complaints from staff.
I, as the company Convergence acted, can identify problems previously hidden by executives who sat in offices in cities or states - such as discrimination, discrimination or unfair practices- to be identified and addressed.
"I can get closer to this wholesale, 360-degree experience with employment," Vitrano said, who leads the risk management group of Ruby Tuesday.
"And we protect our shareholders from employment- law disputes."
I began to consider ethics, values and employee engagement in 2002 after the bookmaker Arthur C. Andersen collapsed due to ethics violations by the Enron scandal, Quinlan said.
It took until the "Society Media to their senses", that companies recognized that they could not prevent that their dirty laundry went online.
"For the use of technology to monitor the Evidence, people used hope as a strategy," he said.
This way, Glint and Converse offer your software as a service, and burden the companies with back-end fees for the use of their products.
This is a business model and a chance to find the approval of Venture Capital Investors who have supported both startups.
Ivercent received $10 million in funding in February from companies like Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, whereas the entire capital raised $47 million.
Itzern secured $10 million in November from Bessemer Venture Partners and raised its entire funding on $60 million.
The investment comes surprisingly, given the connected nature of companies, culture and Venture Capital.
It’s a growing complexity of research that shows that today’s employees expect more from their jobs than ever before.
The competitiveness of emerging markets such as Silicon Valley is high and interesting projects are only a few.
The employees want to feel that you are respected and appreciated and that you are giving your time to a company with a positive mission.
"If the people are happy to be in a company that listens to their voices, and that the work you are doing is worthwhile, then they feel strongly about making this company successful," said Nina McQueen, Vice President of Global Benefits and Employee Relations
The investor achieves returns when their portfolio companies perform well. Companies run well when staff are engaged and engaged.
The Analytics Tools Third-Party promise to increase engagement and the use of the staff, it’s no wonder you’re finding support.
The data on employee engagement after the experts of workplace culture are important.
The data is nuisance when the controller of a company does not take any measures.
If a company employee asks for your feedback, it may have an expectation that change is on the way.
If the change doesn’t come fast enough, or even not, this can breed enthusiasm and demotivate employees.
"If you want to ask for 4,000 suggestions, you have to have 4,000 conversations," said Russell Raath, President of Consulting at the business consulting firm Kotter International, who has seen companies falling too far behind collecting data.
Then if you don't follow staff will ask, "Have you really listened to me?
“Why do you care about that?”
"While you don't care, why should I? "
“Reed, who now conducts monthly staff surveys, was able to take action at the same time when a problem is reported about Glint,” said Errett.
The aftermath of receiving feedback from frustrated employees was prompted by the speed of decision making and quality of communication, in order to organize several teams within the company and add a communications training session to address the issues.
This Ruby Tuesday gives the company new insights into the staff, and it hopes that on a long-term basis, this will lead to better recruitment of workers in a sector known for high turnover.
"If you are not committed to creating a culture of transparency, you will lose the people," Vitrano said.
“When you lose people, you also lose customers.”
If you lose customers, then you will lose businesses.
The NCAA eliminates the two-day practice and makes a long day for the Bruins
I go on to watch a lot of UCLA football players on one side of the new exercise fields of the team on campus.
I have cut off my triceps and showing the back full of sweat from the first day of training.
The good part of the team considers these unpaid minutes a lunch break.
The students who have been accepted to the summer camp will return after the three-hour exercise to their final exams, before returning the next morning at 6:00 p.m. to the Waterman Football Center.
"That's going to be for the boys the next three days a real treadmill," Bruins coach Jim Mora said shortly before the Monday became Tuesday.
The NCAA eliminated two-day practices to alleviate the burden of the players, and it has actually extended their days - at least until the final on Friday.
The first three practices of the UCLA team should start at 19:15 p.m. to match the already full time schedules of the players.
The compromise away from the two days is more than a day that the Bruins missed the start of the camp almost a week after the last season and during the summer school for the first time during Mora’s six games in Westwood practiced practical drills.
I will be suspended in August for 18 practices. 20 before beginning the formative play-offs for their upcoming game against Texas A&M in September.
I said that he supports the rule change of NCAA, even if it adds to the much-loved routes of the players a further point.
"We place this enormous burden three or four days on them, and it is very challenging," Mora said.
I've just been through it, they're placing themselves further, they're great people.
"As soon as we get to Saturday and we have more time, it will be really big."
IUCLA will be suspending its practices as soon as the camp is concluded, which is an indication of clear viewpoints of its fields from an adjacent parking lot and the nearby Luskin Center, a hotel of high class, which has already been equipped with foot
Iins-players are supposed to be in the hotel this weekend, but Mora said there could be a problem once these rooms are available during the season.
"We will fight for our safety," said Mora.
I think that's a real issue, and it's not far fetched to think that the people will rent a room and then put themselves there to record an exercise.
If you have the videoband of a workout, it's a pretty good deal.
I have security there, and we have security guards on parking lot 8.
I will do the best I can with what we have.
I don't make myself any more of a worry.
"We have a plan."
The FBI will expand fact-checking in the fight against fake news
I will send more potential articles with false claims to fact-checkers from third parties and publish their results under the original post then, said the world’s largest online social network on Thursday. It is one of its efforts to catch so-called fake news.
The company said in a statement on its website that it will begin using updated cognitive learning techniques to identify potential false statements and send them to fact-checkers who may be able to interpret results of the fact-check from the original article.
It has been cited as one of the main contributors to so-called fake news, of which many believe that it has also influenced the 2016 presidential election.
The issue is also becoming a major political issue in Europe, although the French elections in May were flooded with false stories, and Germany supports a plan after which social media networks are to be penalized if it violates the law.
The company said Thursday in a separate statement on English that in the U.S., France, the Netherlands and Germany, a test of the new fact-checking system will be launched.
"Near the realization of what stories are being investigated by fact-checkers third-party, the people want more context to make informed decisions about what they read and share," Sara Su, product manager for Facebook News, said in a statement.
I added that Facebook will continue to test its feature to the "incoming article" and work on other changes to its news feed to prevent false messages.
The creation of a comic novel: A castle in the history of England
In his younger days, the little Scotch Castle was featured in a Squeeze music video and was for Margaret Thatcher in the 1970s and 1980s.
The Scotch has witnessed 700 years of turbulent history from its humble seat in the Beamish River Talon in Kent and is now the inspiration for a fictional novel by Jamie Rhodes, a moggy Yorkshireman with a love affair with historical documents.
"I think it's so nice to see the handwriting of someone who has been dead for 300 years," he says weighed in.
"What a personal commitment to hold this letter in my hand."
The 'A Castle in England' chronicles the period from the Middle Ages to Edwardian times and documented the families who lived in Scotland. Each story was illustrated by another, on-site British artist - Isaac Lenk, Briony May Smith, William Exley, and others.
This is not the first book of Rhodes based on an archival collection: He wrote 2014 'Dead Men's Teeth and Other Stories', a collection inspired by documents in the British Library - a project he uncovered emotionally.
"I only reacted to the damning letter on the side of a letter written so far by a double agent in the 1700s who worked for the Jakobiner," he says.
I think that's his daddy's signature!
The letter always smelled of smoke, because then you burnt a fire because of the light.
The person who lives 300 years later has the scent acted as if he were himself also there.
"Oh, I love archives!"
The someone who is so meticulous with old paperwork that he is supported by the National Trust and Arts Council England and spent almost four months living in a castle ("To be honest, I missed my welcome letter a little over the top") seems this all too nice to be true.
Theos spent his days exploring the Victorian "new" castle, visiting the archives and studying the many treasures and curiosities of the castle, such as the montified Hyacinth paintings on the walls and the bottles, bottles and glasses.
I wandered through the grounds and ruins of the old castle and spoke with landscapers, gardeners and sometimes even with the artists who worked on the illustrations of his book.
I, night, drank "Whiskey and started to write".
The intricate history of Scotch is relatively unknown as the National Trust only received full access when the last widow, Elizabeth Hussey, died.
It was Rhodes a few years later that the officers were just beginning to care about the archives, which he described as "half century ago, when Aristotle said "Oh, we're going to put it on the roof."
"Books, letters from the time of the English Empire, maps showing who was who: "You might think land battles would be boring," Rhodes says, "but there was a bird to which the two families fought.
"Look, let everything go its way!"
The stories in the collection use the castle as an introduction to broader British history, including 'The Labourer', which follows a man who leaves the newly erected castle to join the farmer's battle of 1381.
"There is a record of a survivor who died 1380 in the castle, in this book entitled 'The Knights of Kent and Sussex' ", Rhodes says.
The farmer's strike began in this area and I thought a strike was a good start.
"How are the two connected?"
The stories are firmly rooted in the history of the castle - like 'The Priest', which tells the story of the Jesuit priest who hid the family Darrell seven years during the English Reformation.
This is 'The Smuggler', in which the skeleton Arthur Darrell is portrayed from the 18th century, who performed his own funeral by filling a grave with stones (a discovery made only years later when his grave was filled with stones).
The Darrells are Rhodes's family of Scots: "The gentlemen seemed to be pretty generous, always making mistakes and spending money for things they could not afford.
"Generations of Darrell Morgan solved their debt problems by marrying remarkable old women - I imagine them to be a bunch of well-dressed guys with a talent to advertise marriages."
The end of his stay in the castle is Rhodes on the hunt for other unique writing experiences
It has a two-year stay in the Finnish wilderness for a comic book about Elämänmäki behind it, the site of a sanatorium from the early 20th century that has since been reclaimed by the nature again.
The Scotsman has a special place in his heart.
"I was sad to go back," he says.
"After all, now I have to be done with that stupid life."
In progress: Over 300-year-old Marien-Cathedral in Rovaniemi burnt down
The re-opening of the 301-year-old Mary Magdalene cemetery in Rovaniemi has sparked the city’s campaign to introduce a new Dachsmark (Rovaniemi from Thursday).
This week, Mayor Otto Neuhoff and his marketing team to Nelson Artz want to keep the logo and slogan secret.
This August, as part of the campaign, there will be a festival on the island of Grafenwerth.
It's too beautiful for us.
"Why?", ask the organisers of the campaign since yesterday on the posters at the Royal Chapel.
"We don't think that (actually!) doesn't really exist," they write on their yesterday's free website.
IAre you using this measure to gain your attention?
I'm trying to make clear that some things are better than it seems.
"We are of the belief that we as Bad Honolulu residents know the beauty and charm of our city very well."
The campaign is about more than "just" a logo and a slogan, it continues.
"It is necessary to formulate a single promise, one that gives the city an unparalleled Allegiance".
I steadfastly believe in the competitiveness of other municipalities.
The medium-sized five-dollar bill lets the city of Bad Honnef pay for its new roof and the campaign.
Immigration reforms in the Middle East - Erdogan's fear of the military
This year beginning August, in Ankara, the Chief of Staff is meeting to discuss pensions and promotions in the armed forces.
The same as this week.
The first step is a normal one.
The nothing is routine at the Turkish military a year after the coup.
The meeting did not take place in the building of the General Assembly, as previously, but in the office of the Minister.
The consultations took place under the chairmanship of the Prime Minister now also included the five vice-premiers as well as the Ministers of Defense, Interior, Justice and Public Safety.
The civilians in the YAS were in attendance.
The government is pulling in the military trains.
The commander Hulusi Akar remains in office, but the commanders of the armed forces, the air force and the Marines were dismissed.
The failed coup has dismissed 169 of the 326 commanders and advisors.
The 10.000 troops were removed from the ranks of the armed forces - mostly because of supposed links to the movement of ex-President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who is seen as a draconian force behind the coup.
The 485 people who were directly involved in the protests are in since this week’s meeting in Ankara.
The day after the coup, Erdogan had referred to the protest as a "gourmet gift" as he offered to give him the opportunity to "clean up the military".
It has Erdogan’s armed forces really in hand?
In February, the newspaper "Huffington Post" published an article with the headline "Unrest in the military compound".
In general, there are concerns about an increasing "Islamophobia" of the armed forces, which manifests itself in the removal of head-to-head restrictions for soldiers, the newspaper noted.
It’s big work at the military and the security sectors at the same time.
In July, Erdogan fired per decree more than 7,500 police officers, including 2303 officers and 550 soldiers.
I thought it looked like Erdogan had kidnapped the military.
The Corporals galtled earlier than the actual gentlemen of the country.
It put them under the spotlight for their role as whistleblowers of the welfare state.
In his election 2002, Erdogan drained the power of the military step-by-step, notably under pressure from the reforms of the European Union.
The retired officer says Erdogan is planning to target a radical Islamist attack on the armed forces.
The magazine "Vocal Europe" warned a nameless non-combatant, who had been detained after the coup out of fear of infiltration in the country, the Syrian army will be "full of extremists and Salafists".
If that were to happen, a such development could not scare the Nato.
This is why in the Allianz after the slaughter, there is concern about the use of the Turkish military force.
The leadership and operational capabilities are "critical," say Nato officials.
I change the rules for the Green Card
“There will be a new US-immigration plan to change the rules of the Green Card,” said President Donald Trump, quoted by the media.
Immigration reforms see legal immigrants cut to $50,000 per year, stricter regulations for obtaining visas for a temporary work permit and restrictions on family-friendly visas.
The new rules are being drafted by the Republicans and supported by the president.
The bill is to be debated in the two chambers of Congress.
"This bill will reduce poverty, raise wages and save billions of dollars for the taxpayer and will do this by changing the way the Americans are given green cards."
The law will prevent the chain migration and replace the current system.
"This new recruiting process will help the candidates who speak English who have the financial means to support themselves and demonstrate knowledge that will benefit our economy," Trump said, quoted by the U.S. media.
I want to fix the track for race cars
I've talked in the past about the future of the rally shuttle - now it's going to be quite quick.
It will be completed before the end of the year at the maroon track, on which the tourist train rides.
In order to secure the future of the Rennsteig shuttle long-term, according to the transportation ministry, construction is still being undertaken at the track.
"With the decision to order the line Ilmenau Road to be ordered further and to be repaired, Egypt's government is committed to maintaining this important connection," Transport Minister Khalid Sheikh Mohammed said Friday in Erfurt.
The cost of repairing the track was estimated at about £2.5 million.
This sum will overcome the country 75 percent.
The contract, on which the shuttle will be ordered also in the future from the country, is currently finalized, Sühl said.
It said the Ministerial and the Southern Railway as operators were aware of the technical details already.
"That's why the Fahrplan, the used vehicles and the quality standards have been negotiated," Snell said.
The proposed contract between the Ministerial and the Railway Company will be for a period of eleven years.
It is expected to be delivered to the racecourse by December 2017.
The Rensselaer Railway Station is a popular tourist attraction between the train stations Ilmenau and Rensselaer.
It has been tested in the course of a pilot operation to see if the train is being used by enough people to order it in future.
The track is also in some parts stark pedestrian-friendly.
The rising number of sex robots is real, and we should be worried
If you thought it couldn’t get any weirder in 2017, a new report comes out about the technological advances in the field of sex robots.
“Yes, indeed,” he said.
I-Robots are currently a big thing.
The Foundation for Human Rights (SFHR) published a report on the development of sex robots in the next five to 10 years.
The Noel Sharkey, emeritus professor of robotics and artificial intelligence at the University of Sheffield and co-founder of the FRR, says we need to take their uptake seriously.
I can choose the eye color of the robot, its shape of the breast and the type of fingernails.
"The people make jokes about them, but the companies deliver every bit of it, and we're going to see them much more often," Mr Sharkey said at the release of his new report.
The sex puppets have been transformed from their on-the-go partners to robots with a Silicone head that feels warm - with intentional human responses achieved by the artificial intelligence.
The user can also customize their robot according to their beliefs and choose anything from the eye color of the robot to the shape of the breasts to the type or colour of its fingernails.
It will be even more concerning as many robots have the "permissive features" that would make a Stepford woman look progressive.
I've seen sex robots evolve to robots with a Silicone face.
The RealBotix robot allows its users to customize their robots based on the features they find most appealing such as security.
In addition, there are the from True Companion developed Roxxxy Gold Sex Robots with pre-programmed personalities like "Faith Farrah", which gives the impression of protectiveness and "Wild Wendy" with a "abnormal" personality.
"Roxxxy Gold has a personality that matches your personality as much as possible," says the website of True Companion.
I like what you like, and I don't like what you don't like, etc.
I've noticed that in the course of the day, they also have their moods - quite like real people!
"She may be tired, on concussion fix or she may be "in mood"!"
I have many bewildering aspects to this upsurge in sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the underlying feminine traits, the accusations of sexual abuse when you take a step on Frigidaire (heck, it's a joke) and
The website compares True Companion Roxxxy with a vibration, but for men.
"If women (sic) can have a vagina, why can't men have a vagina then?" says it on the website.
The sex robots are not just a fetish or just a different sex toy.
The Entity and its increasing refinement weigh on something dark and deep in our culture, on a retreat from the ideal of equal treatment of the sexes to a desire for sex with submission as an option.
The vast majority of men will seek to hold no sex robots, and while the FRR acknowledges their growing popularity, they remain at the forefront of consumerism.
I think what comes out of the margins can be very helpful in terms of the spirit of the time we live in.
I don't think many people are not racist or discriminatory until they get the free market to give them the permission to do so.
In fact, there is a certain overlap that these high tech sex robots appear in a time when the rights of women are being threatened worldwide, in a time when there is a candidate running for president who has praised women to be sexually abused.
The abhorrent aspect of the television series 'The Handmaid's Tale' ('The Report of the Maggie') is not the graft, the missing body parts and the excruciating eyes, but how realistic this vision looks.
The Republic of Gilead is a blast, but in hindsight, this doesn't feel like a big blast.
The goal behind these sex robots is to create a physical resemblance to actual women as realistic as possible (even with porn stars).
I want to make them feel human, that they follow the movement of a real body.
I, on the other hand, when it comes to their "permissiveness" the robots do not pose any real women.
I can't be separated from my companion or just go away.
I don’t have a vow or background, nothing that hinders unity or anything that could disturb the Phantasm total submission.
In other words, they are gentle slaves.
The way to put it in the context of 2017: servicemen
“What’s the big deal about that?”
I make Mitt Romney into the incarnation of the healthy human being
This has become a symbol of the Trump administration that the political divisions that have polarized the US have also divided families in small-scale.
The week before Christmas and Thanksgiving, there were in the US newspapers with advice on how to deal with the horror of Trump’s choice of candidates.
This strengens us all apparently to make sure our filters don’t plague us.
I have noted the power of Trump to bring families together.
I mention this because my co-worker, a lefty diver who lives in Chicago and has been working with the Republicans in our family, visited me this week in New York.
It reminded me that uniting against a common foe can have a powerful effect.
In Trump’s White House, everyone she knows, including the Republicans with whom she had fought for decades because of the policy, is suddenly and entirely on the same side.
The Esquire is certainly a good thing, but it comes in a further context that this also brings significant risks.
The right-wing movement has been strengthened by Trump, but the enthusiastic effect of his presidency has given us the power to push us all toward the right.
If we're talking about "normalization" and Trump, we're talking about the gruesome possibility that we'll be able to ignore his muses one day.
I do however have a more disturbing long-term scenario in which Trump Republicans of the right are "normalized", which on top of their standards suddenly appear to be inconsistent.
I find myself nowadays of a passive notion for Mitt Romney's urging version of the villain - the dog on the dashboard, the 14 percent income tax (but at least we knew how his tax return looked) - which were both in comparison to Obama's
If Trump goes, the next candidate of the Republicans must be mentally fit to qualify as an unqualified improvement.
I remember when my co-worker was in town, we brought our kids to the carnival in Central Park, the largest of the carnivals of New York City, and the best three dollars you can spend in the city if you don’t need coffee.
The horses are enormous, the Fiberglas designs on the central cylinder - all clowns are knuckleheaded and the animals turn around to look intently over their own shoulders - extremely finicky and the climbing music portrays this on merkable levels.
The many clichés of a city ensue: The views of high buildings are old, the skyline is too familiar to offer much entertainment, and the reality of the city does not match the dream.
It's twenty years later, and I'm still not quite overwhelmed by the fact that Swiss Cottage is in fact not a Swiss Cottage - the theme pub Ye Olde Swiss Cottage doesn't count - but a large circle in the north of London.
The Central Park Carnival is however still a surreal experience as here two two-year-olds, a 11-year-old and two women in the 40-something years can go on it and all have a great time.
If I could have judged the Karussell, I would have given him the full score, but to no avail, no one asked for it.
I was forced to spend this week in a grocery store to evaluate my "experience" with transactions on a scale from one to five stars before I could use my credit card.
The coffee shop at the corner of my street is the same, plus the option to subtract the rating with a 15% drinking fee - this to buy something over the counter.
This does not only lead to a distraction of what should be a neutral exchange, but also exert pressure on the server to include personality in a situation where there is no need.
The poor woman in the store stood enthusiastic grinning, while I was tired of the experience of paying her my credit card with five stars.

This past year, he was treated for cuts to his hand bones in the hospital, which he was told the prison authorities to have caused after a case in his cell.
The 33-year-old was charged with murder after an appeal to the court for a first-degree murder trial.
I killed Steenkamp in the early morning hours of Valentine's Day 2013, when he shot more than twice through a door of the toilet in his house in Pretoria on her.
The Pistorius claimed that he was mistaken for his girlfriend for a night-time intruder who was hidden in the cabin.
The court has announced its intention to appeal this week against the six-year sentence of Pistorius, of which they say it is too after-effective.
The National Crime Agency said it will file a motion at the Supreme Court of South Africa, and the motion may be heard in this year’s trial.
It runs the risk that his sentence will be increased to 15 years if the prosecutors are successful.
I don't think there is a death penalty in South Africa.
The farmer Arnold finds a strange egg
The last of the Blumberger schools were the fourth-grade students from Fulton and Epsom in the summer and transferred to the secondary schools.
The enrolled students will now go to GCSE, four will go to the high school.
The board of trustees welcomed on Tuesday evening the parents and representatives of the public at the Civic Center Bistro in Epsom.
The symbol of the school’s acceptance, the 29 students of the fourth grade under the guidance of Sophia Schumacher and Regine Meder chose a young Adler who will be raised in the shelter, then forced into the freedom.
I led the munter crew to perform a musical called "The Adler in the Hill on".
The Arnold found a strange egg, and let it be eaten by his hens.
I saw a hunk came out a little adder.
The hope of making out of him a shepherd broke out, the Adler broadened on a high hill his legs and encroached upon it.
I showed the classes three and four in the assembly of Yvonne Frank performing a hammock.
The heiress danced with the young goats, who wore cylinders to the game.
The advisory committee steers clear of discrimination, said school principal Angelika Sitte.
I thought the bird was different from the other birds (cocktails), geckos, etc.
I will be but never be like a hunter.
I believe His obligation is to be free.
I wish every fourth grader to feel welcomed in his new school.
I followed up with a thank you to the staff, the former school principal Michael Moore, who always intervenes when students are absent, and the parent volunteers.
In the meantime, it is now over, explained classmate Sophia Schumacher.
I enrolled my students after two years of teaching only very unfortunately, because it was a really great time.
This time she has been able to rely on the fourth graders.
In closing, all of the students sang a song of summer and holidays.
The bravery of the children was greatly appreciated.
The new school year has already attracted eight first-year students.
The Bulgarian man arrested for illegal camping in Greece
The Bulgarians were arrested for illegal camping in Greece, according to the Ministry of Interior, quoted by the BBC.
The morning of August 1, in Sithonia was arrested by the police a group of illegal zygotees, including the two Bulgarians.
The same day they were released, while currently undergoing an investigation.
It was reported by bTV that the Bulgarians were later released.
The Greek authorities have tightened control over the free campgrounds and placed anyone found to stay at a place that is not intended for this purpose substantial fines.
The controls will continue throughout the entire season.
The Ministerial said that the court can issue a money order.
The latest update for diesel trucks: What the affected drivers now need to know
I don't know exactly where the software update takes place?
I'm trying to get diesel cars to participate in the campaign?
The most important questions and answers in this guide.
The Diesel Summit has offered BMW, Daimler, Opel and the Volkswagen Group software updates for more than 5,500 cars.
It aims to improve the fuel efficiency of cars of the fuel class Euro 5 and partly Euro 6 engines.
I-4-Diesel or worse are excluded.
In addition, Smetanin from the ACE Auto Club Europe gives anecdotal evidence:
The new campaign is mandatory?
I agree that the agreed software updates are voluntary.
"The mandatory updates previously applied only to the vehicles that have shoebox software," says Anja Smetanin.
It has been recommended that the Kraftful Vehicles Act (KWV) be amended.
“When and how will customers be informed about updates?”
The manufacturers have promised a speedy implementation in the coming months, but have not announced a specific date.
I have asked for any affected person to contact me.
I without a doubt will have an inspection pending, which will be done in their discretion.
I wonder how long would the upgrades have to go overall?
"Scary to say it," says Smetanin.
I hesitate to mention the commitment of the manufacturers as well as the political pressure.
"From what we have seen, voluntary actions of the automakers have not been taken on the issue of environmental concerns."
I'm wondering how long does this update take?
The repair itself could only take three to four hours.
The longer it takes, the harder it becomes to get a date.
I make cars that don't drive a car from BMW, Mercedes, Opel and the Volkswagen Group?
The ACE advises you to wait.
I would expect foreign manufacturers to follow suit, according to Smetanin.
I now see a massive price drop from Euro-4 cars?
The ACE believes that.
This is just in the regions where speed limits are imposed.
In the rural area, there was no value-added benefit for older diesel engines.
The ACE advises, with a sale still to be made.
I Cool J erhält Kennedy Center-Preis
The Kennedy Awards Gala is one of the most glamourous events in Washington.
The first award given under President Donald Trump promises to be political.
The prize winner doesn't want to come - out of protest.
The Cool J (49) gets as the first rapper to win one of the prestigious Kennedy Center Awards.
This year, the cultural institution announced that in addition to singer Gloria Estefan (59), Lionel Richie (68) as well as the choreographer Carmen de Laval (86) and the TV producer Norman Lear (95) are among the honorees.
The awards will be given beginning December.
This week, US President Donald Trump will host a reception and be joined by his wife Melania at the ceremony.
The with progressive TV dramas known as Lear, he has already announced that he will not be able to participate in the Gala.
The "New York Times" said: "This president has decided to ignore the arts and human rights completely - even the means - and that burdens me."
The 59-year-old Estefan said she will use the meeting with Trump to clarify her views.
It is named after the former president John F. Kennedy. The Kennedy Center is the largest cultural institution in the US.
The previous winners include Meryl Streep, Aretha Franklin, Robert De Niro, George Clooney, Tom Hanks and Sheldon Cooper.
I make the city feel more alive
The Wacker, Haslam’s city builder, will retire in the coming year.
The position is already advertised - suitable candidates are however rare.
The 31-year-old is Wacker City Architect.
The work still makes him feel great, as he explains in the press conference.
It reports on a variety of challenging, but also rewarding jobs that are waiting on its successor.
I also notice that there hasn’t been any application that meets the requirement.
The City is looking for a Architect or Building Engineer.
It should be - under the terms of the regulation - still plenty of time for a review.
If Haslach is formed for the Council as a Understanding Building Code Authority, the candidate must present appropriate certificates of completion.
This function wants the city to retain on its own.
If they can’t fill this out, the citizens would have to drive to Offshore.
The citizenship of the city and its residents is important, says Wacker, who speaks of a good working environment as well as good communication between government and citizens.
The more than 30 years in office have resulted in some significant projects, on which Wacker has prided himself with pride.
"We make the city more livable," he is confident about the building department and its staff.
This year, a number of aesthetic projects are on the agenda: The redevelopment of the former Hukla Avenue and the Lower Park area are being targeted.
The Kincaid Bridge between Bolton and Steinway is being repaired, even though the stadium is still subject to renovation.
I'm guessing that last one will fetch about $1.5 million to $1.5 million, "if we're doing it right," Wacker says.
Along the way, I'm expecting great things from my successor.
"Working here makes me feel better."
I believe that for a city builder, there is great flexibility.
If Haslam's own building and gardens can be adapted to Many, it could be fairly flexible.
"You can do much," says Wacker, and the design of the green spaces will be mentioned by residents and visitors often.
The town as an ensemble undergoing restoration is important to have "a sense of what fits in," when new buildings are approved, says the borough's mayor.
Along the way, the city builder bears high responsibility.
"Builder," he says, "among other things, everything is going to run here over my table".
The care and coordination can be found on long-time staff: Marc Neumann (Houston) has been there for ten years, Manfred Schöner (Twenty) has been there for 15 years.
"That his replacement is long gone," says Wacker: "We're looking for someone who is really committed to the position and wants to stay".
Immigration was not only important for a good working environment, but also for the further design of the city.
The Roland Wacker who wishes to be buried should be able to demonstrate to the City of Hasselt a bachelor’s degree in Architecture or Bachelor’s degree with a minor in Architecture and have good knowledge of the areas of construction and planning law.
The City Council undertakes high-density construction, urban planning, ground-breaking projects, management of the borough’s land, Sightseeing Office with buildings and city parks as well as Underground Conservation including Historic Preservation.
I've been thrown on pipes: South-facing tunnel is shut down
The police had suspected the previously unknown thieves had thrown the blue bike from the train crossing in the area of Leoben Street (B118) onto the pipes.
It was damaged so severely that the approaching cargo had to be escorted at all costs.
The detectives are looking for two male suspects and have been searching for them since the night.
The scene was watched by witnesses a red Roller Roller and a bicyclist.
"That goes far beyond a lawn mower," said ÖBB spokesman Christoph Posch to the AP.
The or the robbers had put themselves in great danger and also threatened the train service.
The damage to the locomotive and the facility as well as the missed minutes and the cost of the locomotive repairs could also leave pockets of the Railway customers on the hook.
I am of a "erroneous" mind," said the spokesman.
The damage was repaired Friday afternoon, the train traffic on the southern line was able to operate without disruption.
The ten person trains were cancelled Friday morning, two of which betrayed the ferry service.
The trains did not fall out, they had however delayed.
A ÖBB-Sprecher Christoph Posch had to replace about 200 meters of Oberleitung.
The lawn and masonry were also damaged.
Inflammatory foods such as meat, dairy products and chocolate could help reduce IBS (inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract)
The meat and chocolate can be bitter for your digestive system like a Alptraum.
The new study claims exactly the opposite: A diet rich in lean proteins and dairy products could alleviate the symptoms of patients with encephalitis.
The uncomfortable condition, which affects around 1,3 million Americans and in Britain, causes migraine headaches and bowel problems, back or blurred vision, weight loss and extreme fatigue.
If the sufferer is normally advised to cut out meat and dairy products to alleviate their symptoms, researchers at Washington University found that the essential amino acid tryptophan of proteins helps to develop immune cells.
The lead researcher, Dr. Marco Colonna, explained that immune cells in the digestive tract are patrouilized to ensure that bacteria that lurk in food do not enter the body.
The enzymes that are impairing the immune response are replaced by enzymes that promote the immune response and protect the body without damaging tissues.
The balance is too far in favor of enlargement neck can result in an enlargement of the colon.
In experiments, it was found that a type of tolerant immunity has been observed in mice carrying a specific bacteria in their intravenous tubes.
The bacteria requires tryptophan - one of the building blocks of proteins - to produce the appearance of the cells.
I Colonna said: "We have a connection between a bacterial type - Lactobacillus reuteri - which is a normal part of the digestive tract, and the development of a population of bacteria that promote the immunity.
"The more tryptophan the mice had in their diet, the more they had of these immune cells".
The researchers concluded that the combination of L-resinic acid and an anxiolytic rehydration tolerant diet promotes less endocrine disruption when the same system is also applied to humans.
The post-doctoral researcher Luisa Cervantes-Barragan examined a type of immunity that promotes tolerantness when she found that a group of studymäus had such immunity, but a different group of the same genome, which was separated under the same genome.
I suspected that the difference had something to do with the digestive tract of the mice - the community of bacteria, viruses and bacteria that normally live in the digestive tract.
The intestines of the mice were DNA-sequenced and there were six bacteria types found in the mice with the immune system, but without them at the time.
The mice were placed in a sterile environment so that they didn’t have a colonoscopy and they didn’t develop this kind of immunity, and they received the L. replication and the immunity was created.
In order to understand how the bacteria were affecting the immune system, the researchers placed L. reuteri in a flask and then transferred small amounts of the flask - without the bacteria - to uninfected immune cells.
The immune system developed to the tolerant cells.
If the active component was removed from the flask, it appeared to be a component of the Tryptophan Metabolism, which is known as insulin-like molecules.
The researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in the feed of the mice, increasing the number of such cells by about 50 percent, but when the tryptophan levels were halved, the number of these cells sank by half.
I. Cervantes-Barragan explained that humans have the same tolerant immune system as mice, and that most of us have L. reactive proteins in our immune system.
It is not known whether tryptophan-like compounds from L. reactive proteins develop the immune system in humans as well as in mice, but mutations in genomes in relation to tryptophan have been found in people with encephalopathy.
I said: "The development of these cells is likely something that we want to promote as these cells regulate infections on the inner surface of the digestive tract.
"Perhaps high triglycerides levels in the presence of L. reuteri may lead to an increase in this population."
I believe that Manchester United has signed with Nemanja Matic a "guy"
The Manchester United has signed with Nemanja Matic a "great deal," according to Jose Mourinho, after the midfielder had made his debut against Sampdoria.
The 40 million pound subscription of Chelsea started off with a 2:1 victory in Dublin, the last pre-season game before the UEFA Super Cup against Real Madrid begins on Tuesday, and proved invaluable in the Halsey role as people like Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereira scored
Itic was however excluded from the pre-Autumn tour of the Blues and only managed 45 minutes, which meant that he had to improve before starting the Premier League season.
"He needs time, but his experience, intellect, a genius in the way he thinks - he thinks football," Mourinho said.
"We will help him, sooner than later."
The Mavs also started Victor Lindelof and Romelu Lukaku in the Aviva Stadium as Mourinho formed his starting XI for the start of the season.
The Independent endorsed in this week that Mourinho would like to have three more transfers, but he insisted that the club had already done a "fantastic job" of fulfilling three of its four pre-season transfers.
"Did you get four of four, for that I thank the club," he added.
"I will be happy if they get forgiveness for me four of four, but they have been great."
I "painted" Dreamliner in the sky
The US aerospace company Boeing has painted the silhouette of a Dreamliner in the sky.
The pilots floated from Seattle in the US state of Washington, the zeppelin started but floated into Marquette in US state of Michigan and landed in the shape of a Dreamliner over the United States, which is several hundred miles away.
The campaign lasted 18 hours and one minute.
It was the shape of a Dreamliner.
The whole thing was an endurance test for new engines.
I had already seen such advertisements before.
The number "787" and the Boeing logo were painted in the sky.
I'm sorry for the deep dish for Martin Luther King Jr. - Atlanta, we have a problem
The tide turns: When Sarah Palin was still a Democrat, social-democratic ministers looked ahead to elections always with a certain concern for Berlin.
I don't want to hear any stink from the party front, just no opposition from the state - so said the most important wish of the candidates.
The Martin Luther King, Jr. party has changed radically.
This week, the staff from the Willy-Brandt-House have watched with growing enthusiasm the happenings in the Republican-controlled local governments.
In fact Schulz has been coming from there since the beginning of the year, wouldn't be described with counterwind not even in context.
I was experiencing tremendous storms.
I suppose one after the other.
The Conservatives see the unexpected end of the redistricting coalition in North Carolina a general signal against coalitions of Democrats and Republicans.
"This shows once again: Republicans can't justify regaining power," Democratic General Counsel Peter Tauber told the editorial board of the New York Times.
The unexpected resignation of a Republican governor has thrown the government of minister Stephan Weil (UKIP) into a bitter mess.
This month, his conservative coalition lost its one-third majority to the opposition from Democrats and Republicans.
The Republican Congressman Michael Kellner has urged the aboriginal niece of the Republican candidate, Eleanor Twesten, to return her office.
The move to the Conservative Party means a clear misrepresentation of the voters.
"Twesten has to immediately give up her seat," said the vice chairman and candidate of the Green Party to the editor-in-chief of the New York Times.
"That shouldn't even be true," sighs a Republican candidate as the new Hispanics message reaches the party's parliament.
The Weil, Republican governor of North Carolina, stands up after the removal of Republican candidate Elke Twist to the Conservative Party without own government.
This is the precursor to a whole series of big and small crises in Democratic lands.
I don’t know what comes next.
The misfortune began with the unprecedented dramatic victory at the Saarland election in March.
“Blue eyed, more not,” said the Genovese of that time.
The landmark elections in Scotland and Wales will be all the same.
If it was then - and indeed it was - everything was much worse.
The victory in Kiel put the SPD in its place, the Düsseldorf victory made the party glatt.
The Genovese rallied again in the weeks following.
I, when they just had new courage, came the G-20 summit from Hamburg.
I met with him the next deep blow.
The Oval Office, the last strong Republican governor, lost its Nimbus because he sat in the Elysium while his city burnt down.
I because he was in crisis communication after so much of what you can do wrong.
It is Scholz's political destiny.
I also have Stephan Weil.
In the VW scandal and his role in the board, the niece has been in the spotlight for some time.
In addition to the survey results, other statistics came along.
I, or perhaps just because, tried Weil in the past week to push stronger in the Bund.
The best wishes of the former mayor of Hannover to expand his power in Berlin remained secret, even Genovese in the vicinity of Martin Luther King Jr. remained secret.
I let him, as they were promised by Weil a stability of the party.
This could be the exact opposite.
This strikes Weil at the partisan zing of the niece's conservative party in the first place.
I don't think Schulz already.
This is why the Genovese are trying to keep the own ranks closed.
The outrage is directed at the Republicans, and here it is most likely to be the abhorrent Senator Twesten.
"It is unacceptable and democratic to assume that Mrs. Twenty-something puts her own career interests over the interests of all others," says Matthew Miersch, head of the party's editorial board in the House of Lords, the editorial board of the
It is not because of her person as a candidate, but through the state list of Michigan Republicans in the House of Representatives, according to the Michigan Republican.
I suppose the logical consequence would be that she returns her mandate.
The Oppenheimer, chairman of the House of Lords, blames a "undemocratic maneuver".
"The vote of four years ago was clear: The people have made Stephan Weil to Minister of Interior," says Oppermann, who leads the niece's party as the top candidate in the House of Lords, the RNC.
"Nun misleading the personal career of a candidate is to mislead the candidate's vote," Oppermann said.
I asked for the behind-the-scenes to be investigated.
I want to know if there was more or there were further calls from the Democratic Party of Michigan.
I. Funding for Orthodox Church III
If you want to replace your inherited house, you can get the help you need from the government.
I informed Mayor Albert Schindler and three representatives of STEG City Development on Tuesday in Earl’s Court.
The beginning of the information session gave Schindler a glimpse of what has been going on.
In 1991 there were in Epping Sanctuary Sanctuary Areas.
This year, in Sanctuary I from 1991 to 2004, the state has still taken up two thirds of the fund.
I Sanctuary II from 2005 to 2016, the exemption was still at 60%.
In Schindler's words, the recent renovations are a "success project" - it was finally important to encourage the interior development, and not just create new construction areas.
The 4th April, you received from the Government of Kentucky the information that there will be a Sanctuary III.
The grant amounts to 833 333 euros, of which 500 333 will come from the state, the rest from the county of Epping.
The result is now a Sanctuary?
I will, so Smith continues, investigate where the "real old" houses are.
It also plays a part in whether in the proposed area there is any interest in replacing it.
It may be that the territory borders could be crossed again.
The STEEL performed on Tuesday night Martin Keller, Gabby Pietschman and Sarah Gotzel.
I presented the contents of the federal program "Solar City", in which the repairs would then be performed.
The goals of the program are the revival of inner cities, the improvement of living standards and creation and upgradation of infrastructure.
The measures would be subjective, that is, per property.
The Sanctuary would then finally be established as a charter.
The application period for the funds has been extended from January 2017 still until April 2026.
I would have to wait until September this year to do the assessment, in order that the at-risk residents would be given a questionnaire to fill out.
The November or December will be sufficient to make the bylaw, so that in the coming year, the repairs can begin.
Izschman then explained that each municipality had to perform the required pre-surgery tests.
I’m going to review the city’s neglected infrastructure and decide when it will be repaired and in what order.
It will be recorded for that particular property then a Sanitation Certificate in the grounds register.
Itzschman will be able to come back to Earl’s house and take a look at the situation, she promised.
Izel said, a key success factor for the project was the involvement of the stakeholders.
I will be sending out questionnaire which will be sent out in the next few weeks to the citizens and can be filled out by the end of the summer.
The green questionnaire is the "building and property survey," where it is primarily concerned with the structural condition and the repairs proposed.
The gray questionnaire, the "Household Survey", can be used to make statements about size, layout and residents of a residence.
The blue "Business Form" is only filled out when in the building are business spaces.
This is to be remembered, as Gotzel pointed out, that a completed questionnaire is not simultaneously a request for funding.
“New construction projects are not eligible for tax credits.”
It added that the distribution of funds based on the "Windhundprinzip" functions - who comes first gets first.
I could not reserve funds for later "reservation".
The closing ceremony included photos of the project "Orchard II" to show the attendees a restoration "clean".
The inventor sets himself up a microchip to come up with a hand motion in house and car
The British inventor is the first in the country to be equipped with a microchip so he can open his house, enter his office and even start his car.
The Northam, 33, had implanted the winged chip between dagger and index finger and now offers the service to companies and individuals who want to simplify their lives with technology through his company BioTeq.
I have teamed up with Dr. Geoffrey Watson, a consultant Anatomist in the Royal Hampshire Hospital in Winchester, Hanover, to ensure that the implant procedure is performed according to medical standards.
The technology is similar to a cat and dog implanted microchip and takes only 30 seconds.
The company of Mr Northam also wants to change the locks to houses and cars so they are compatible with the chip, all for a fee of £300 per lock.
The retired father of one has now added both to his BMW Z4 technology, which starts when his hand is on the wheel.
The advertising costs of the White House cost the taxpayer hundreds
The decision of the White House to fly a Marine vessel to South Carolina for a demonstration marking the moon landing last month will cost taxpayers according to figures of the military, which have been given to TIME magazine, up to $60 million.
The green-colored Sikorsky VH-3D, known as Marine One when the president is at sea, was the heart of the event on July 17th in the White House with U.S. construction programs.
The Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and leading officials of the White House made a tour of products from all 50 states.
In Connecticut, the Hubble Hubble was installed alongside a yacht from Maine, a fire truck from Wisconsin and a gathering truck from Mississippi.
“The military office of the White House demanded the presence of the Hubble in a fragmented order or FRAGO, barely 36 hours before the Hubble landed on the South Lawn, according to the recordings of Marine Helicopter Squadron One (Squadron One),”
"I just wanted to make sure you were aware of it because it is a sophisticated event with high visibility," the commander of the HMS-1 wrote at the conclusion of the event, referring to his predecessor, the commander of the Marine Corps for air
The news showed that the Hubber arrived at 7 p.m. on the South Lawn for the incident at 15 p.m., and so stayed until the grass was cleared between 18:00 and 21:00 p.m. on that night.
The note notes that, if the departure from the White House should be delayed due to the restriction of service hours, a second team would be needed for the return flight.
The original pilot was stationed during the event at the Hub, while the security personnel of the unit spent most of the time on the ground at the aircraft.
The TIME's recordings did not clearly indicate whether eventually a second pilot was needed.
The Hatch Act prohibits federal officials from using government property for political purposes.
The quotes show that HMX-1 asked whether the incident could violate the requirement.
"One of the questions we asked was whether it was a violation of the Hatch Act and we were informed that this was not the case," the commander wrote.
"Kling as if you were confined," replied the lieutenant-colonel.
The event "Made in America" was referred to by the White House as an official event and wouldn't be covered by the Hatch Act.
I also believe that official events have political undertones.
The event gave the president an impulse for reforming health care reform, which was in the Senate, and he promoted the efforts to amend the government’s regulations.
The use of the aircraft, known as Marine One or Air Force One, from politically favored purposes is not a new phenomenon.
I am obliged to use them for the trip.
The use of their use only for a photo-op is unusual.
This led to an investigation in February, when the president piloted the drone before the start of his first campaign rally in Melbourne, Florida, taxi services, and his Twitter account is full of tweets about the use of the drone by his predecessors.
"The White House is delighted with the show "Made In America" - which shows products from all 50 states made by American workers using American materials," said the vice-president of the White House, Lindsay Walters.
IMX-1 battalions frequently conduct training exercises in the area around Washington and in South Lawn, to help the U.S. president in the White House with precision targets.
In July, when Trump was on the G20 summit in Germany, HMS-1 conducted 58 exercises.
The flight for the "Made in America" -event counted in the training needs of the pilots for the month, said a spokesman.
The aircraft flew additionally 11 hours at this time for "National Air Force Unknown Missions".
The White House said the taxpayer has not taken the burden for any of the other remarks made on the event.
The spokesman for Sikorsky said the company was not involved in putting the Hubble on the South Lawn.
IMX-1 does not undertake budgeting for the presidential flights, and it is difficult to estimate the exact cost of the event.
The hours charged by the U.S. Department of Transportation for the fiscal year ended June 2017 is the DOD exemption for the VH-3D however $24,500 per flight.
The records of the unit record the flight time of the plane as 30 minutes from the home base of the Marine Corps Air Force base in Quantico, Virginia.
The White House argued that the actual cost of operation of the Hub is far below this rate.
"The cost for the taxpayer on the basis of estimates for the reimbursement amount is highly improbable," Walters said.
"These figures include personnel, maintenance and many other hidden costs included in the annual budget."
This is based on a RAND study from 2015 which included the compensation rates for DoD not include the personal expenses, but include the cost of fuel, maintenance and contractual agreements.
In this way, the former press secretary of the White House, Sean Spicer, defended the use of drones for the event.
"The idea is to present this week things made in America," Spicer said.
I know Sikorsky and the state of Connecticut are very proud of their contribution to our national security, and I am concerned that hundreds, if not thousands, of people are dependent on them.
I think like most Americans we are all proud of the Hubble and other military equipment for which so many Americans have worked unparalleledly.
"It is natural to highlight that."
I wasn’t sure if Trump intercepted the drone when he took his turn over South Lawn for the incident, but he placed himself in the driver’s seat of a fire truck.
The White House spoke to representatives of Sikorsky and chatted with the media about his own fleet of corporate products.
"I know Sikorsky very well," said the president, "I have three of them."
“Bow Neuss vor knife-thrower”
The second-round pick of the Second Division plays at home to the defending champions of the state.
The TC Blue-Weather is scheduled to play tomorrow at 11 a.m. in Kiel at the home of the league’s defending champion Sucha.
This after five matches still make up for the loss, the top scorer of the Second Tennis League has gained the sense of reality.
The manager, Marius Zay, has certainly respect for the opposition.
I think this is a compact team that always plays in fairly similar form.
"On the behind-the-scenes, I think the team is very good."
It’s class and stability at the top of the hills at the Sheriff’s squadron are primarily the imports from the highlands.
In the meantime, the Irish and Finnish can even vow to play in the Davis Cup.
"She's also strong in doubles," says Zay with Blicks on Harri Heliovaara (Finland), Andre Göransson (Scottland), Sören and Esben Olesen, Martin Pedersen as well as Andreas Bjerrehus (all Denmark).
"That will be as hard for us.
"You also need a good dose of luck."
The neck of the game for the trip to the highlands is practically sealed.
The debut for Blue-Whale might be Maxime Janvier.
The currently playing in the Challenger League in Italy’s Biella active Frenchman doesn’t make it to the Bundesliga play-offs, coming to the game in the Czech Republic playing Zdenek Kolar (Twenty-five) to make his first start in this season.
The previously unbeaten Chilean Hans Podlipnik-Castillo was playing yesterday with the White Russian Andrei Vasilevski still at the ATP Finals in Kitzbuhel.
I should have been in Kiel but as well as Botic Van de Zandschulp, Niels Lootsma (below) and the Belgian Julien Cagnina.
Ignoring his two losses last Sunday against the club at the Alves could also make Máté Valkusz return to the team.
The 18-year-old Hungary, who was in January 2016 still the number one of the Junior World Rankings, doesn’t fill someone out of the coaching staff around Marius Zay filling the roster.
I think America's Occupy Wall Street can hurt the Occupy Wall Street
In fact, Donald Trump didn’t seem happy when he put Tuesday’s signature under the law to curtail sanctions against Russia.
"In his haste to pass the law, the Congress has inserted a few "legal provisions" into it," he said.
The response from Moscow was as shocking as expected, and even Brussels blamed the US for the incident.
The bill also proposes to punish European companies that help the Russians build gas pipelines in the EU.
This has caused concern among investors of the local OMV, which has jointly funded with other European companies the construction of Russia’s North Sea pipeline.
I think the drone is hilarious.
“It is too early for an assessment of the consequences,” according to the official statement of the oil company.
I suppose Donald Trump would have to face the sanctions still per Executive Order to live up to them.
The wounded weapons are up to him to choose.
The "Presse" has looked at what the company could do and which could really weaken it.
Incos Season 3 Trailer: Without Pablo Escobar, the Cali Cartel is brought into the spotlight of Netflix
The second season of Narcos, which reveals Pablo Escobar’s killer, is yet to be released by Netflix.
The seasons three and four have already been confirmed by streaming service Netflix, the first received its first trailer and showed the latest villains of the show.
In the third season, the DEA has focused its attention on the most lucrative organization of drug trafficking in the world: the Colombian cartel.
The four powerful Pattons operate "like a Fortune 500 company" only with more state-owned subsidiaries and corruption.
Io Rodriguez Orejuela (Damian Alcazar) is the leader of the Kartell, Miguel Rodriguez Orejuela (Francisco Denis) is her head, Pacho Herrera (Alberto Ammann) commands the Mexican-American connection, and Chepe Santacruz is the
The new trailer knights Pedro Pascal as Javier Peña, the type of guy who encourages Mexican and Colombian law enforcement to join the war on drugs.
The new cast include Matias Varela, Michael Stahl-David, Matt Whelan, Miguel Angel Silvestre, Kerry Bishe and Arturo Castro.
The third season of Narcos will start on September 1st.
The rise: The city is putting 46 kitchen workers aside
The city organizes the school luncheon again itself.
I have fixed contacts for the children and a commitment to the team.
The borough’s children’s libraries will be re-opened.
This September, the City of Krefeld will take over the food service in the borough’s elementary schools again in its own hands.
Ison Pommeranz, Associate Director of the Department of Youth Services, says this is a good thing: "We all enjoyed it."
The cooking continues outside the house: A caterer takes care of this task and delivers fresh food cooked at home.
The city has 46 kindergartens, in 44 the children get a warm meal.
The past year, each child sat at the table, and the need has risen steadily.
"Mitchell doesn't eat not only children who have 45 weeks of care in the school to midnight," Pommeranz explains.
"This offer is also available in the 35-hour program when children stay until 14 p.m."
The part-time staff will have kitchen service: They heat up the delivered food, add salad, raw vegetables and fruit, portion the meal individually, give the food away, clean up, and clean the kitchen.
"The workers will be placed firmly in a care facility," Pommeranz says.
The size - there are two-group as well as seven-group facilities - determines the hours of service.
"The kitchen assistants are now integral to the Kita team," Pommeranz says satisfied.
"So they are much more involved and it is easier for the school to implement pedagogical concepts".
The same goes for healthy eating and cooking lessons.
"The children should help prepare the food".
The direct connectivity of the kitchen staff to the team is where it is needed.
I'm sorry for the children.
"You have a known force in the school, a person who is familiar with them, and not constantly changing people".
I believe that consistency is important for the children.
The disposal of the child care facilities - previously also assigned to the kitchen staff - will be carried out by specially trained cleaners.
The option - the separation of cleaning and kitchen service - has added to the quality of the kitchen service also the charm that it has made in cost-effectiveness between homeownership and foreign ownership for the city as the most economical, according to the press release.
This, though 46 part-time staff are being re-enlisted.
"Anytime these hours fall at around 750 people in the elderly, they aren't as much of a burden," says Sonja Pommeranz.
“Afghan democracy depends on the political role of women,” says the U.N.
It can only be reassuring when all members of society, including the women, play a role, said the the commander of the U.S. mission in Afghanistan on Tuesday.
The Haysom, amphibious leader of the Mission of the United Nations, said that hundreds of women will be running for elected offices in the provinces. Three women are running for the role of vice-president and more than 30 percent of the newly registered voters are women.
"The role of women cannot be overlooked," he said Tuesday in a statement.
I can only be truly reassuring and credible when women are unaffected and participate in all parts of the election process.
The provincial elections for the province and the presidency are scheduled to be held on April 5th.
The Taliban have published threats against a presidential election that come with the transition of international combat operations to a consultative role.
The elections will be held for the first time the power will be transferred democratically from one democratically elected government to the next.
Isom said a strong role for women will further strengthen the democratic success of Afghanistan.
The afghan Independent Electoral Commission reported that 1,261 women of total registered voters were registered.
In honor of the TV's 75th Anniversary
In honor of its 110th anniversary, the TV Kaisering invites you to a little hike with followed by coffee and cake.
The walk starts at noon in Frohnstead at the water reservoir in the American Way.
This is where you go to the landing site, to the naval basement and over to the woods again to the water reservoir.
The walk takes about an hour.
I'll be in Kaisersville in the school cafeteria serving coffee, cakes, soft drinks, sausage rolls and baked goods.
If you need a ride from Calgary to Frohnstead: Meet in Calgary at the school.
The 14-year-old girl trys to rob
The young men in their 20s and 23s were arrested on Thursday trying to rob a 14-year-old girl.
If information is correct, the men spoke to the 15-year-old girl, who was visiting friends at the Collegiate School, around 14.55 p.m. because they wanted to chat with the phone of the girl.
The 13-year-old refused the request but continued to hang out with her friends.
It was then that one of the robbers tried to grab the phone and the halo of the girl, which failed.
The beast flew the Duo.
The two young men were later arrested by the police.
The investigation is ongoing.
IMB's concerns about investments in the McVitie factory in Glasgow
The union wants to speak to managers of the Biscuit manufacturer McVitie about the long-term commitment to production in their factory in Glasgow.
IMB Scotland said the company has failed to speak about the future of investments at the Tollcross facility.
The more than 500 workers are working in the factory that manufactures along with other products Hobbies and Rich Tea Cookies.
Ivities owner Pladis said he has invested more than £5 million.
I added that employees and civil servants would "be the first to know" when their jobs change.
"In a letter addressed to the Filiale of the company, GMB Scotland McVitie's requested that the financing for the modernisation of production lines be not pursued."
IMB Executive Director Drew Duffy, said: "The fact that we can't gain from the General Manager any clarity on the business needs and investment plans for the future of Tollcross affects our members to a great extent.
The vast majority of families have worked here and the workforce focuses heavily on the local community and the Greater Glasgow area, a vital hub for men’s employment in a region with high levels of poverty and social exclusion.
I needed under the perspective of jobs, the pay and welfare, and ahead of Brexit, rising living standards and the chronic production decline, the northern end of Glasgow needed a florist production presence at McVitie.
The spokesman for Pladis said: "The branch manager at Tollcross has just received a letter from GMB Scotland, and the company will immediately respond as we appreciate the ongoing commitment to employees and union members.
I had a regular meeting with staff and GMB representatives at Tollcross, where some questions were discussed openly.
I discussed with the staff that we as all companies operating in a highly competitive and uncertain economic climate, need to monitor our business continuity - and this applies to all our operations and locations - to remain competitive.
It added: "In recent years, we have invested in our Tollcross facility more than £5 million, including in production lines and operational improvements.
"We recognize the history of Tollcross as a manufacturing facility fully. Should our operations change at the location, the employees and their unions will be the first to know."
It was the Saints Barcelona that were warned three years ago about Neymar?
The side of La Liga may regret their interest in Marco Verratti
The Saints won’t be following in their vow of Neymar after they dropped an offer of £189 million to clear his suspension, but have they warned Barcelona three years ago before the World Cup?
The sensational move has boosted the transfer window in summer, as the Ligue-A champions are ready to break the world record by more than double the previous record, although Paul Pogba has been transferred in the past season for 89 million pounds to Manchester United.
In the end, Neymar will be the most expensive player in the world and the highest paid professional player in the world. Paris offers salaries of more than £500,000 a week.
It is worrisome about the way Neymar has forced his way out of the club, although a source in the vicinity of the Barcelona manager insists that the club has always given his best since his arrival from Santos in 2013.
The football world was warned three years ago by the Paris Saint-Germain president about this prospect?
The Manchester City 2014 interest in signing Blaise Matuidi had led Nasser Al-Khelaifi to a strict warning for any club that wanted to sign one of the best players of the Premier League.
"I am not worried because they know that if they touch one of our players, then we will stand in opposition to them, we will contact their players," Al-Khelaifi said.
I respect all clubs.
"If they try to sign one of our players at once, this will have consequences."
I seem to have crossed this line, although the Portuguese club began to express interest in the Saint-Germain midfielder Marco Verratti.
This made it impossible for the International from Italy to travel under any circumstances, and Barcelona could feel the consequences of this interest by losing one of its price offers for Neymar.
I've been thrown around and damaged
In the early hours of Friday night, a suspected thief has smashed an in the King Street parking lot near the address 30 abroad and caused so far to the interior of the vehicle damage of over $200.
The police Sheriff’s Office, Tel: 07422-2701, asks for information.
If you witness an accident on the highway 215 between Stolzenau and Leese, the police are looking for witnesses.
Ignoring a car on his roadside, the driver of a Volkswagen Touran drove away and touched the Leiter Plane.
The 34-year-old from Rehoboth-Loccum was traveling with his truck at about 19.55pm on the B295 from Stolzburg to Leese.
The area of Stolzenau was approached by a truck on its roadway, so he had to turn left.
I touched the touring car's Leiter.
In the meantime, the Pkw en-route was damaged.
The driver of the opposite vehicle, a Mercedes Benz, had overtaken a Lexus and continued driving without paying attention to the collision.
I can tell you that according to the accident victim well, the Mercedes driver hadn’t noticed the collision.
The police are now asking for any witnesses of the incident as well as the driver of the colliding vehicle to call Crime Stoppers at 519-792-6400 with the Crime Stopper in Stolzenau.
"Dominion's brief endorsement endorses Pope Francis"
The Regents' report on the sexual abuse scandal has been endorsed by Pope Francis.
I mean, according to author and historian Michael Hesemann.
The final report on the sexual abuse scandal at the Regent's Cathedral continues to raise questions.
"Weisenberg, spokesman of the reform movement "We are Christians," said after communicating to the Associated Press, he expects to hear from former Regents and today Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller as well as from Domicile Gregory Ratzinger, the 93-year-old
It would serve the interest of the Catholic Church very well if Müller and Ratzinger expressed their deep disappointment over their own submission or their damaging interpretation of the proceedings.
The Vatican's "Osservatore Romano" however argued that when reporting on violence at the Vatican, it should be measured with "worse measure."
Ignoring the attacks in Regensburg, no one doubts that it was "criminal and damaging acts" that should be punished and in future prevented; on the other hand, the "great media manipulation," according to the author Luce, "is a
"The anger towards the Catholic Church as the source of all suffering is already part of everyday experience and prepares the public to accept that for normal," says Scaraffia.
The Forrest Gloria of Thurn and Taxis said in an interview with the Bay Area Telegraph: "You go to church and that's a found freak".
"However," she said, in her teenage years, "violence was a quite normal parental tool," "to deal with freaking children, like I was one, to be finished."
It would be unfair to apply today’s measurements to earlier years as the world has changed.
The reporting of the sexual abuse cases often included Pope Francis.
I'm sorry to say," says author and historian Michael Hesemann, who co-wrote with Ratzinger the memorial volume "My Brother the Pope" (in 12 languages).
"I have to take George Ratzinger in my care," says Hesemann, "but all this had nothing to do with him," werting the results of the final report.
In what exactly is the 440-page report that the Archdiocese of Regensburg has filed with the Commissioner of Justice Ulrich Weber?
The 547 Regent's Chapels were bombed between 1945 and 1990 "with high probability" of being victims of attacks, 67 Chapels were sexually abused.
The final report says to Georg Ratzinger, who served from 1964 to 1994 in Regensburg: "To date, however, it is also evident that from Domicile R. have been used in many instances forms of physical and mental abuse.
It was at high intensity that the punishment for the students was even brutal.
"In contrast to numerous other suspects, many victims felt the general humaneness of R. and therefore in numerous instances despite violence even felt positive memories of him".
The interview explains how the final report on the miscarriage of the Regent's son-in-law, George Ratzinger, has been endorsed.
In Hesemann's 440-page report on the "cause of violence to protective dogs at the Regent's Palace," he gives a wider picture of Domicile George Ratzinger.
I have seen many students raise their "Mental" level.
In other words, he appears to be a choreographer and perfectionist who was despised handsomely when a Dom’s performance didn’t bring a top performance.
I owe you as his biographer this final report?
This Hesemann: If you want to take the time and read the whole 440 pages long report from the very beginning, you have to wonder why the name George Ratzinger is even mentioned in it.
The book is just eight pages long and it is clear that any conviction of conviction or conviction of sexual assault will be free.
The violence exacerbated at the preschool occurred outside its effect.
I can't blame him all the way for being too late or first and foremost not being taken seriously enough.
The temple on which he performed was regarded by virtually all of the interviewees as - so to speak - "healing", "history" and "brighter world".
It also gives the broader majority of his students George Ratzinger a quite exaggerated grade, describing him as "warm-hearted", "beautiful", "comfortable", "comfortable" and "politically correct", as a highly well-educated teacher who
The minority complained about his perfectionism and his high emotional sensitivity, which also led to whining.
The fact that he was not only hitting stones and throwing the keys on the floor, but also throwing earrings and all manner of freaking boys at the hair or ears has been tolerated, to no avail.
In his honor, however, it must be remembered that such interventions were widespread in the fractured 1960s and 1970s, at parents as well as teachers.
“Do you also have those Zündchen-Methods?”
I, I think every one of us born before 1968.
I have experienced this yet again in a welcoming school, a state school.
I agree with what is supposed to be said in this report, that the ensuing sexual abuse and the violence exacerbated on the preschool, are free to be bagatellised.
I wonder if it has anything to do with his reputation and his role as the brother of Benedict XVI that many media are just screaming at him.
I'm sure you're working with many who never understood him yet still either way.
The truth though is: The report enlightens George Ratzinger in every way possible!
In the media, in the wake of the report, there has been very much talk about the issue of abuse at the Regent’s Chapel.
I wonder if Georg Ratzinger in the final report also has any guilty or conviction in relation to sexual assault?
“Hesemann: Ganz klar,” he said.
The only one of the 67 victims of sexual assault claims to have been the Domicile.
It was once the parents were admitted.
"I have never been afraid to speak with my father or my mother about it," said a victim consciously for the others, "It was all very petty."
I believe the real problem with surveillance of sexual abuse was and is yet to be that the majority of victims are from shame.
I don’t think they had any parents and siblings at all, then quite possibly not a choir director who was supposed to be some sort of colleague of the murderer.
This belongs to the Catholic Church’s role in the Missile Crisis?
The Heseman: A concerned student stated it as follows: "Because of sexual abuse... I... see... no case where auspiciously, he (George Ratzinger) would have had time to make informed decisions and have kept the respective victim on the safe side.
I agree... even if it is really absurd to assume that from him... Bubbas have opened up a lot more clearly or even more openly than their parents, interns, trustees etc.
"If you talk to him about sex... - unthinkable."
The report comes to the quite clear conclusion: "The fact that him in front of affected students and/or their families were at risk was not confirmed in the course of the investigation".
The sexual abuse of minors is Georg Ratzinger also entitled to any conviction.
I may also not be accused of not preventing him or bringing him to trial.
I also have no reason to associate my good name with these wider-ranging crimes, as it has happened in some cases.
In the media, there was much talk of "glamorous scenery" at the Regent's Palace.
The former Catholic priest George Ratzinger is referred to in the report "Weekly".
I suppose he could live with this accusation?
This Hesemann: That’s the big issue, that in reporting everything was missed and misplaced to create a massive mess of sexual abuse and violence exacerbated and somewhere, right there, George Ratzinger.
The exact same is again a misconception of the report.
It's actually cleaned up: Between the Preschool and the College of the Domingues, between sexual abuse and violence exacerbated by the school as well as, say, other allegations.
The report discusses incidents from 1945, also from four decades in which George Ratzinger was not choir director of the Cathedral.
I wholeheartedly apologize to the PBS, the cases in which K-12 students were abused by sarcastic teachers routinely schizophrenic and maltreated and suffered darunter litter, all occurred on the preschool in Ettersburg and the school in the same
It had nothing to do with Dom Pastor Georg Ratzinger, for he got the boys to face him when they were already on the Domspawn gymnasium.
The subject was, as the most prominent witnesses insisted, the subject of "preschool."
I was just happy to be her enemy and enjoyed the so much better treatment and for many even "paranormal" circumstances.
I was going to be different on the Dom’s gymnasium?
Ihemann: There was some disrespect, but just no sadistic violence.
The same is true for George Ratzinger, when the report comes to the conclusion that "some victims cherished the general humanity of R. and therefore in numerous instances despite violence even associate positive memories with him".
It remains at least the presumption to have looked away.
This despite all efforts, the report only defined two periods in which he was informed of the circumstances on the preschool.
The first time was 1970/71, when he was just beginning to develop and from the previous years at a school where he didn't act and be responsible (so the witness) didn't hear anything, and then only again around 1993.
It closed George Ratzinger’s doors before the tides of konseyed the ears?
The Heseman: No, because already 1989 he wrote a letter to the Director of the Catholic High School, which the report even reproduces.
Iin weighed in on this, "that in the preschool, the punishment will continue to be the plight punishment".
Along the way, he warned against negative press releases.
This was obviously to a time when legal clarity was assured as punishments were also in place in California.
Ivory erected themselves in a legal trap, as any of us probably know.
It was also difficult for him to predict where the victims might have been overlooked or dramatized and where really the tolerated threshold had been crossed.
I can't say he'd ever gone away.
I just don’t think so.
It was in 1980 that the punishment was lifted at schools even in California officially.
Instinct Gloria of Thurn and Taxis claimed that it was unfair to apply today’s educational standards to the 1960s.
“How do you see this?” he asked.
Ihemann: We historians are talking about the "faith of the Anatole," which is the danger of judgement based on today's moral standards.
I think the forgiveness has already come.
The same does not apply to sexual abuse, which was to all the time abhorrent and even more so to what was done in the preschool at Widowed and abused children’s seats, which goes far beyond what was then commonplace.
This is all quite scary and I'm glad it's finally being worked on.
Along the way, I must take George Ratzinger in mind, for all this had nothing to do with him.
The means of disguising and besting yourself, such as earring and pulling at the hair and ears, were widespread in the 1970s.
The physical punishment then was also strictly prohibited.
The image of his Regency time has George Ratzinger ever been re-recorded in the conversations with you for the book "My Brother the Pope"?
The issue of punishment comes to mind too?
This Hesemann: Well, in the book, it’s about the life of his brother Joseph, also Pope Francis, told from his perspective, as the Doms played only a minor role.
I didn't mention that he ran there a strict regime.
“But even that must be said: Without this perfectionism, without that requirement of strict discipline, it would have been impossible for him to form from the until now rather nationally known Regent’s Palace a institution of world class, true cultural ambassador of Europe.”
The keenness and Bonfire alone makes you from wider knights now a big singer and stands up for every success, no matter on what level, yet always maintaining discipline, passion and self-discipline.
The what kind of person have you ever encountered George Ratzinger at the talks to her book?
Hesemann: Through the work on the book and beyond, I really have come to know George Ratzinger really quite well and continue to experience him as a wonderful, humorous, fundamentalist, deeply religious and hermeneutical person, of whom you can’t get enough of.
I get regular updates on how many former Doms are still alive, 23 years after his Emergency, keeping regular contact with him, visiting him, reading him - he is almost blind - and treating him like a member of their family.
The ones who have not conceded to him until now that he was once strict to them are also clearly in the minority.
The majority of Doms today are grateful that he has blessed their lives and helped them discover the world of music.
I remember that he was always a good, tender teacher - a strict father, gewiss, that may be - but yet a loving respectful one to whom they still look on and whom they just love.
This please, again, be quite clear: All you are trying to teach him are educational methods that were at the forefront of his mind.
I can't believe we've passed this time.
I think it is hypocritical to make a man, just because he is prominent and has a more prominent brother, to be the media scumbag.
This is the blatant intention that is behind it, just all too obvious.
The report, which has just been published, enlightens him.
It would be the antidote for a 93-year-old man who has earned great respect and without whom outside of California and perhaps even America probably wouldn’t know the Regent’s Palace, finally in peace.
