b'The recently passed law of Missouri that makes it harder for people to win discrimination cases, as well as the criminal courts of the state that are unfair to minorities, forced the group to release the travel warning.'

b'The White House takes the liberty of Trump the freedom of speech'

b'The Miller, one of the key ideologues of the Trump campaign, certainly knew what he was doing when he used a symbolic axe in a fierce debate with Jim Acosta of CNN about the proposals made by the president to drastically restrict legal immigrants with to freedom of movement.'
b'If fair enough, Miller did not touch the statue himself.'
b'The horde of boat owners and Liberty Impressionists would have lynched him if he had done it.'
b'Ignore their significance, and especially the significance that was given to them when the famous poem by Emma Lazarus, composed 17 years after the completion of the monument, was added to its basis.'
b'The Miller Acosta commented: "I don\'t want to go on a complete thing about history, but the Liberty statue is... a symbol of American freedom that illuminates the world.'
b'"The poem you are referring to is later added and is not part of the original freedom statue."'
b'This is sarcastic, but as he himself stated, it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t really relate to storytelling.'

b"I didn't engage in literary criticism - he made clear that these people weren't welcome in Trump's America."

b'Theus - and her friends who were determined to place their words after her death at the basement - knew very well that they were performing a high-profile act.'
b'The sculpture should show the connections between French and American republicanism by showing in a faded classical painting the weakness of liberty.'

b'\xe2\x80\x9cShe gives herself a whole other name: Mother of the Exiles.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'The association of the poem with the image is a brilliant feminist co-operation and a brutal attack on the American nativeness.'
b'The exact same way Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, the people from the right side wanted to reverse this long ago.'
b'The big-mouthed Rush Limbaugh, a sort of Johannes the T\xc3\xa4ter for the coming of Trump, argued 2010, that the Liberty statue shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t attract anyone, but rather be a early neo-liberal symbol that brings the American flame into the umpteenth century:'
b'I shall carry the flag of freedom from the United States into the rest of the world.'
b'"The Faculty shall not illuminate the way in the United States."'
b"I'm surprised Limbaugh is here on something."
b'The significance of the statue is entirely a matter of the standpoint of reason.'
b'The great phenomena of Lazarus was to see her as she was seen by the elderly, but hopeless people after long and often cruel voyages on the decks of ships.'
b'I\xe2\x80\x99m in the realm of seeing the world from the perspective of people looking for refuge and a chance to improve their lives.'
b'The statue speaks to them the words of hope and welcome they must hear.'
b'This is obviously not the perspective that Miller and Trump would ever want to see.'
b"I don't want to illuminate the way, but the hate that is their only source of power."

b'The team\'s captain says she is "extremely proud" of the fact that many of her Landsmen will not only be part of the team, but in some cases will be involved in the Olympics and at the Finals.'
b'The beauty of being Team Captain is that she was chosen by the other members of the team, so it was probably a big honor, but knowing that my teammates voted for me and voted for me makes it something special.'
b"I'm honored to be a part of all the scholarships that come to the team."
b'I just don\xe2\x80\x99t know how far we\xe2\x80\x99ve come.'
b"I'm here as a established athlete, athlete who wants to be on podium."
b'\xe2\x80\x9cWhat about my speech as a captain?\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'I, I think she went well.'
b'I just wanted to let you know that we are in this situation very happy as we have a home-season.'

b'"In 1783, Washington said, "The speech may be taken away - and, dumb and stunted, we shall be led like the horses to the slaughter."'

b"I'm not a reactionary heat gun."
b'I have a firm hand in leading his state and strict enforcement of the principles.'

b'The blocking of individuals coming on to the side of the Governor - which is a public forum that is officially recognized and operated by staff paid with public tax dollars - is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous.'
b'In an interview with The Washington Post, Hogan\xe2\x80\x99s spokesperson Amelia Chasse defended the actions of the governor and argued that blocking comments was nothing more than a moderation.'
b'I think it is too easy to use the image of trolls or spammers or hassle-free people who are online pushing the peeps.'
b'The Post spoke to some of the really people who were blocked by Hogan.'
b'This is just real people talking to their elected leaders: a teacher, a businessman and a pastor, no trolls.'

b'"I don\'t agree with this idea either, when a number of people take up the same issue, then they are seen by some rather than a so called collective effort and not recognized as a large group of affected citizens".'
b'The staff of the governor\'s office called it a "conspiracy spat" would likely call others "fake news."'

b'The Indonesian president, in popularity known as Jokowi, promised during his campaign 2014 to address the unrest and the rights abuses in Papua New Guinea.'
b"The former Zimmerman secured 27 of the total 29 districts of Papua - including Paniai - on the way to the president's palace in Jakarta."
b'In Papua New Guinea, things have changed little, and today the locals feel they are being abused.'
b'"Unfortunately, our hearts are broken because we voted 2014 for Jokowi, with the expectation that he will fulfill our hopes of restoring the peace again," You said.'
b'In contrast, Paniai suffered only two months after Jokowi\xe2\x80\x99s inauguration in October a downturn.'
b'The 7th of December 2014, a group of 11 children were outside and sang Christmas songs before a campfire in Enarotali, when two Indian soldiers on a motorcycle broke through the darkness.'

b'\xe2\x80\x9cOne of the soldiers took notice of her tone and returned later with four soldiers,\xe2\x80\x9d said the local pastor Yavedt Tebai.'
b'The soldiers who had died were hunting and killing the group with their guns, said victims and witnesses.'
b'I fired one of the soldiers into the group of children.'

b'The demonstrators began throwing stones on police and military posts.'
b'"When the mood was up, the soldiers sent a message via an internal communications channel: "If the masses do more than three times resist, they shoot them dead," according to an official document from TIME, which was not released to local media.'
b'Theemias Kayame, 56, the leader of the Kego Koto-Villa of Enarotali, saw the dreadful danger and called for calm and urged the crowd to return home.'
b'I was in the mood to listen.'
b'"When I turned around, I was suddenly shot in my right hand," he said TIME on the veranda of his brightly painted wooden house.'
b'Theme still doesn\xe2\x80\x99t know who escaped, but says that the cub came from the ranks of the here beloved soldiers.'
b'"It was overflowing, many shots were fired," he adds.'
b'The aged man Alfie Youw was shot three times, as was his co-pilot, who was witness to the shootings.'
b'"I ran to him and examined his body to make sure he was it," Yohanes said, who like many Indonesians only wears a name that reads TIME in dim light.'
b'"I saw that he was dead... I\'ve kissed him."'
b'The chief of the Papuan police force, Yotje Mende, told reporters that his officers wanted to protect their station only because it would be attacked.'

b'"It\'s about life and death."'
b'The Human Rights Watch said five young demonstrators were killed and many others were injured.'
b"The news of the killings came out at the following day 'filtered' to Jakarta."
b'This week, Jokowi held in Jayapura a leidensive speech, in which he expressed sympathy for the families of the victims and schworked the historical misfortunes in Papua New Guinea.'
b'"I want this case to be solved immediately so that it won\'t happen in future," he said.'
b'The Minister Wiranto said in October 2016, that he intends to institute an arbitrary process to settle historical human rights abuses.'
b'The excuses began to come almost immediately.'
b'The majority of injuries have occurred before.'
b'I was in the 1990s and early 2000s.'
b'"The point is that we are obliged to address these violations, but there are processes that need to be followed," he said.'
b'It made Wiranto a return as he spoke on June 5 in Jakarta with TIME and said he had no plans to establish in Papua a complaint mechanism.'
b'"Everything is regulated," he said.'
b'Ianto, who has been accused by the U.N. of "crimes against human rights," which resulted in more than 1,000 deaths in East Timor\'s blunt unrest from 1999, said that 11 cases of human rights violations have already been reported in Papua New Guinea'
b'The Paniai victims took such claims with grim remorse.'
b'"I have been interviewed in the past three years four times, but there was no progress," Yohanes says.'
b'"I\'m tired," he said. "I\'m tired."'
b'I tell him that years later he still lives in fear.'
b'"I have fear," he says.'
b'"I have fear of being arrested by the military, have fear of being murdered."'
b'The brother Yacobus again reaffirmed the belief that the people in Paniai fear to discuss the incident.'
b'It says that he was shot by the military after he helped save four of the victims.'

b'I joined the "Free Papua Movement" (OPM), the rebel army that claims to defend the rights of the Papuans by launching sporadic attacks and enemy encroachments.'
b'The top OPM flagships are from Paniai, including Ted Yogi and Daniel Yuda Kogoya.'
b'In response, in recent years, hundreds of people have been arrested in Paniai and willfully placed in jail, under the guise of "suppression of national sovereignty".'
b"I'll never be able to catch up again."
b'The people of Papua New Guinea are known as Paniai as a "tragic, forgotten place."'
b'The poverty increases the unemployment.'

b'I am astonished at the range of Reichweite.'
b'The people here build up everything they eat: most of it is bread and fruit and leaves.'
b'The farming is the responsibility of the women who can each manage four or five fields of sugarcane.'
b'I retain the majority of the crop for the family while the rest is sold on the local market.'
b'The piece of note cost only 10.000 Indian rupees (75 cents).'
b'In recent years, economic uncertainties have risen between the ailing Papuan people and the new migrants who have arrived since opening new flight routes to the airport nearby in greater numbers.'

b'I have rarely had the capital or the necessary skills to run my own companies.'
b'"The young people are not interested in staying in the village... because here there is no jobs or money," says John Gobai, the leader of the Stammes of Paniai.'
b'Ilation keeps the eyes of the world away from Papua.'
b'In addition, restrictions on reporting international media remain.'
b'The French journalists Franck Esquire and Basil Longchamp were denied permission to film because of lack of coordination with respectable institutions from Papua despite being given the rare permission to film.'
b'The Phyllis Kine, the Asia-Pacific director of Human Rights Watch, said the promises of Jokowi\xe2\x80\x99s election campaign to lift restrictions on reporting to promote transparency and development were not realistic.'
b'"There are new threats to Indonesian journalists trying to report from Indonesia\'s undeveloped northern provinces of Papua New Guinea and West Papua: Visa refusals and a blacklist," he said in a statement.'
b'The lack of press control means that the international pressure on the Indonesian government is far from being limited to the immediate vicinity of Papua New Guinea.'
b'In March, six peaceful nations - Tonga, Nauru, Papua New Guinea, Tuvalu, the Marshall Islands and the Salomon Islands - demanded the UN to investigate the "profound and widespread human rights violations" in Papua New Guinea including the'
b'The same countries have historically supported the OPM.'
b'The spokesman for the Indonesian Foreign Minister Armanashi Mehmood wielded the accusations of the group and told reporters in Jakarta: "In Indonesia, there is still a democratic system, and there are free media, so it is difficult to find the evidence for human rights violations."'

b'"Jokowi is a person who has good intentions, but he is surrounded by the people who are involved in the Paniai fights," says Gobai, the chairman of the Stammes Council.'
b'I want to make sure that Jokowi knows that the Paniai population, aside from being under the constant threat of a brutal military presence, is living in arms-of-war facilities.'
b'Iai says that the Paniai people, like other Papuans, view their vote for Jokowi as a "chance" that he has to pay back.'
b'"You don\'t need money, they just want justice," he says.'
b'The threats and assaults carried out by families of the Paniai suicide victims led to a last symbolic act of solidarity: the body of a victim was found on a site just opposite the police and military station.'
b'I know they may never get justice, but at least they let the responsible for their crimes not forget them.'
b'"A member of our family was killed," says Yacobus with geseated head.'

b'The government said it is working on providing support services for the affected people.'
b'The incident may raise questions about the safety of materials used in exterior walls of high-density buildings across the world.'
b'The investigation by the management of the Torch Village after its fire in 2015 revealed that the majority of the damage came from the ventilation, the exterior decoration or insulation.'
b'In Britain, the police said they believe the system of ignition and ventilation at the London Fire Station in June could have contributed to the racket of a fire that killed about 80 people.'

b'The president of the International Tennis Federation (ITF) is upset with his big Davis Cup coveted victory at the General Assembly.'
b'In the meeting in Ho Chi Minh, the for this sport revolutionary proposal to play Davis Cup One only on two wins was hauled up not supported by the required two-thirds vote.'
b'The often very long, but just because very popular Five-Say-Kitch remains the tradition.'
b'I,54 percent of the member states voted for the reform, the goal of ITF President David Haggerty was therefore only knapped.'
b'I respect this decision, but am disappointed that our member nations did not approve the entire reform package for the Davis Cup and Fed Cup.'
b'"We need a change to secure the long-term future of these iconic and historical competitions," Haggerty said.'
b'I will continue to work on improving the recruitment process.'
b'It wasn\xe2\x80\x99t until voting ended after many objections had been made that the proposal was made to hold the Finale at a neutral venue.'
b'It\xe2\x80\x99s just a few minor details: So the finalists in Davis Cup and Fed Cup will now have the first round of the playoffs.'

b'If 1 out of 5 U.S. passengers bring prohibited items into the airplane, find a survey'
b'The survey among flight passengers found that more than 20 percent intentionally or unintentionally threw illegal items at checkpoints of the U.S. Transportation Security Administration, including at least 6 percent who betrayed the plane while carrying illegal guns or other weapons.'
b'The more than 1 percent claimed they had mistakenly discovered that they were irresponsible with guns, ammunition or explosives.'
b'The survey at more than 1,000 people - conducted by a Jet Charter Service, the Stratos Jet Charters Inc. - also found that younger travellers were more likely to violate the rules.'
b'The respondents who said they were able to fly knowingly with something that was banned by the TSA were 19,7 percent Millennials, compared to less than 15 percent who were members of the Generation X.'
b'The most common items that were dropped at TSA agents abroad were food and liquids.'
b'The more than 34% admitted knowingly carrying weapons with knives through security, while 2,24% of the female respondents and 34% of the male respondents also confirmed that they carried abroad illegal drugs in the plane.'
b'The company said it had asked travellers across the country to find out how many had brought illegal cargo through the airport security system and how many had done it abroad.'
b"I'm not surprised that the people who carry the most slipware - knowingly or unknownly - through security were those who were most likely to fly."
b'The company weighs in that the TSA regulations are somewhat complicated and confusing.'
b'The people are often uncertain what liquids they are allowed to take with them or how much of them.'
b'I\xe2\x80\x99m also not surprised that the largest number of the TSA\xe2\x80\x99s possessions are prohibited drugs.'
b'I remember a long time ago people dared to think that TSA could see books as discarded discardware.'
b'Immigration is allowed on inbound flights, but not on international flights.'

b'If you\'re a Tesla fan, you\'ll want to keep up with the huge number of pre-orders for its new Tesla "Model 3".'
b'I have previously underlined that a portion of the customers have cancelled their free reservation already.'
b'The always triumphant figures to revenue growth and yet gigantic sales targets have revealed Tesla\xe2\x80\x99s latest quarterly earnings report has revealed a different, less glancing number: the number of cancellations at the new mass market model.'
b'I had been inundated in the past few months with the more than 500.000 pre-orders for the new car, whose rollout is just beginning.'
b'I agree with Musk: Of the total 51,500 pre-orders, 6,500 have already been cancelled.'
b'I had repeatedly pointed out that it was merely reservations.'
b'If you cancel a reservation, Tesla will refund the $1000 (in the US $1000 and in Britain $1000) "reservation fee" fully.'
b'I estimated that there would be 455,000 such preliminary reservations, Musk said in a phone call with analysts.'
b'The cancellation of previously around 12 percent of all orders could become a problem, the Tesla CEO believes.'
b'The argument: The challenge with the ambitious growth targets is not in supply, but on the production side.'
b'The last year, Tesla delivered 84,000 vehicles.'
b'I hope it will be - all models together - 500.000, 2020 a million.'
b'The demand for it is obvious.'
b"In Musk's case, currently there are 1800 reservations to be made."
b'I just ordered a "Model 3" today, I can expect early in the second quarter of 2018 with the release - if Tesla manages to test its naked, yet never tested production roads without any major undertakings with maximum availability.'
b'The experts doubt that this is possible.'
b"I don't think it's going to cause any major disruptions, then the uncertainty of reservations could become a problem for Tesla."
b'If then the company can\xe2\x80\x99t prevent unhappy customers from running into chains.'
b'IEPA chairman Pruitt pulls himself from the hiatus in the rules of the Obama-era to reduce greenhouse gas emissions'
b'The day after he was dismissed by 15 states, Scott Pruitt, the chief executive of the Environmental Protection Agency, took his earlier decision to delay the implementation of the rules of the Obama administration to reduce the emission of smoke-related air pollution.'
b'Iitt presented the change when his agency responded to the needs of state environmental agencies more responsive than previous administrations.'
b'I did not mention the suit which had been filed against his previous position in a federal court.'
b'I\xe2\x80\x99m talking about a deadline that expired on October 1 for states to comply with the standards of 2015 for bodily ozone.'
b'The governor announced in June that he would extend the amendment to a year to give his administration more time to study the plan and to avoid "sitting into local decisions or hindering economic growth".'
b'Iitt, who before his appointment by President Donald Trump was Chief Justice of Oklahoma City, was long been a reliable supporter of stricter environmental regulations.'
b'Ignoring his arrival in Washington, Pruitt has repeatedly tried to block regulation or delay regulation that threatens the chemical industry and the industries of fossil fuels.'
b'The sudden change from Tuesday is the latest legal backlash for the Pruitts regulatory rollback.'
b'The U.S. Supreme Court has ruled that the EPA has exceeded its authority when it attempted to implement a rule of the Obama administration that requires oil companies to monitor and limit methane gas emissions.'
b'In a Tuesday\xe2\x80\x99s statement, Pruitt suggested that his knee-jerk move at Ozone standards could justify the willingness of the U.S. government to cooperate with the states through the complex process of timely fulfilling the new standards.'
b'"Unlike previous administrations, the EPA has often failed to meet the deadlines for execution and then waited for activist groups and others to intervene, and in a meeting to determine the date for execution," Pruitt said.'
b"I don't believe in regulation by courts, and we take deadlines seriously."
b'"We also take the law and authority that it gives us seriously."'
b'I agree with the statement of the EPA that Pruitt will eventually use its "right to delay and all other legal remedies" to ensure that the regulations "are based on a solid policy and the best available information."'
b'The Republicans in Congress are calling for a comprehensive revision of the Occupy Wall Street Act.'
b'In the last month, Congress approved a bill designed to slow down the implementation of the rules from 2015 to at least eight years.'
b'The measure has not been approved in the Senate yet.'
b'In New York, General Judge Eric Schneiderman, who led the coalition of states that had challenged the EPA in this week\xe2\x80\x99s ruling, said the group beefs up the legal pressure on the U.S. government.'
b'"The removal of the EPA - after our suits - is a major win for the health and safety of these 7,500 New Yorkers and the over 115 million Americans who are directly affected by the smoke that flows into their communities," Schneiderman said.'
b'The Yorkshire counties included in this case California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Minnesota, New Hampshire, Maine, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Virginia and Washington and the District of Columbia.'
b'I-Ozone is created when chemicals from cars, power plants, oil refineries, chemical plants and other sources in the atmosphere react to sunlight.'
b'The resulting smog can cause vulnerable groups of people serious ailments, and each year contribute to hundreds of pre-existing deaths.'
b'The public health and the environmentalists jumbled over Pruitt\xe2\x80\x99s unexpected course of action.'
b'"It is disconcerting how much pressure it takes to get this reasonable step taken by the responsible for protecting the air we aspire to," said Lori Ann Burd from the Center for Biological Diversity.'
b'"We must continue to fight the ideological crossroads of the Trump administration to respond to environmental concerns and their special interests".'

b'Its idyllic setting and nice views of the town make the Historic St Hilary Square a popular place to visit.'
b'The visitors of the sixth Benefit Symposium can be inspired by this kraftful place.'
b'The restoration and preservation of the old building in the town have attracted the friends and supporters of Tumlingens to their cause.'
b'The Martini says: "It\'s a unique dwelling".'
b'"In 1267, the St. Hilary Chapel was first mentioned in the W\xc3\xbcrttembergic census: Graf Hermann von Sulz sold "the hill with the surrounding church to Tumlingen along with the vows" to Magister Earl of Horst, who had been in charge of the church.'
b'The wording of the pamphlet stated that on the Tumling Hill besides the apostle\xe2\x80\x99s chapel was also a heritage site to which the church or the patronage had been assigned and not omitted.'
b'I also saw people living there.'
b'The description of the Mayor\'s Freudenstadt of 1858 indicates that along with the underground and the upper town, which are still to be seen in the town of Tumlingen just now, was the "Berg" the third, the heritage Siege of the'
b'The maps from the year 1600 underline these geographical features.'
b'The patronage law originated from the early medieval property rights.'
b'The Lord who built a church, equipped it with a priest, remained faithful to this church and could repay this property.'
b'It was associated with the right to nominate a priest or recommend the priest to nominate a new priest.'
b'The old church was in the churchyard and two bells were on the turret.'
b'The largest of the two burnt at Christmas 1673.'
b'The newly erected Gloves were first issued in 1692, but had to be withdrawn later in the Second World War in 1942.'
b'It was during the 30-year war (1616-1648) that the windows were assaulted and the bells were broken.'
b'The roof was undone.'
b'This year, French troops were stationed in the vicinity of the church.'
b'I burnt down the cannon and church stoves and used them as fuel.'

b'The 1860s the Tumling Hilary Field also served as the final resting place for the dead from H\xc3\xb6rsfeld.'
b'The church was expanded and the Hilary Chapel was abandoned.'
b'The church was left standing.'
b"The New Year's Eve, 1834, a sword struck the church and the half struck a hole."
b'Ignoring a glitch, the turret was abated.'
b'The now preserved turret remained as evidence of the 750-year-old church history.'
b'I owe Horst Kallenberger and Robert Wasem of the "School Renters" as the replacement of Dieter Dockhorn the Hilary-Annex.'
b"I invite the friends and supporters of Tumlingens to attend the sixth Serenade on the old graveyard to St. Hilary's Chapel."
b'The song is performed by the Combo of the Kepler High School Freudenstadt and with lyrics by Kurt K\xc3\xbcbler and Reinhold Matteis.'
b'Its leader Hartmut Romann speaks the final words.'
b'The program starts at noon.'
b"I'll be at the door at 15.30pm."
b'In honor of the Serenade, a funeral will be held at the graveyard.'
b'"Get a summer night under the shade of old trees and with the farthest view across hills to the forest," the organisers put out the fantastic view.'
b'The Serenade is only held at dry weather.'
b'The organisers hope to attract many supporters to the preservation of the historic St. Hilary Memorial, which is important to Tumlingen and H\xc3\xb6rsfeld.'
b'The friends and supporters of Tumlingen feel the community is especially important to them, as Serenade organiser Walter Martini says.'
b'I want to check approval of wind turbines'
b'The "Boishead Writer" doesn\'t see any legal requirement for the construction and has been referred to the Land Council.'
b'The association "Boise Whistleblower" has asked Landlord Andreas Coenen (CDU) to renew its approval for the construction of proposed wind turbines in the Boise Nettle.'
b'In order to be left-handed.'
b'The association argued that at the time of approval on December 31, 2016, in the Boissali\xc3\xa8re Nette hadn\xe2\x80\x99t even been installed any wind turbines, since to that date in Viersen was only at the city\xe2\x80\x99s northern edge a wind turbine conveyor belt'
b'In this conurbation, construction and operation of wind turbines are generally possible, to the extent that the conurbation has but a restriction on wind turbine use for the remaining urban area.'
b'Thelei Zones are designed to prevent a "sparing" of the landscape.'
b"The City of Viersen had just a few days ago approved by amendment to the land use plan a second wind turbine constellation in the Boundary Nette - which hadn't been approved by the City Council of D\xc3\xbcsseldorf, due to a form error."
b'"Due to the lack of planning permission, the issued permit is after all constitutional and therefore should be revoked," said Christopher Erkens, executive director of "Boishead Writer".'
b'It\xe2\x80\x99s up to you: The City Council approved before the summer session again the wind limit zone in the Boundary Nette; a permit issued by the City Council is yet to be issued.'
b'Ikens: "As a result, at this time, the issue of a permit for the construction of wind turbines is rejected".'
b'The circle confirms the receipt of the request.'
b'"The correspondence has been received since last week by the county," said a spokesman.'
b'The county takes it upon itself to investigate the matter again.'
b'I do not anticipate that the process will be stopped.'
b'Ignoring ongoing hearings at the administrative tribunal, the county council did not inquire into the arguments of the association "Boishead whistleblowers".'
b'The NEW Re, a subsidiary of the NEW, is planning on a site at Boislar Nette the construction of four jet-powered wind turbines.'
b'The company, which is owned by the City of Viersen, has entered into lease agreements with the owner of the approximately 65 acres of the property.'
b"The addition of the four wind turbines will help cover the electricity needs of around 11,400 households - that's about one fifth of the electricity needs of all fourth-generation homes."
b'The NEW Re wants to invest about $20 million.'
b'The previous summer, Viersen City Council gave green light for the purchase of three wind turbines in the Windpark Linnich at Aachen as well as a participation in a wind turbine project in \xc3\x9cbach-Palenberg in the county of Heinsberg.'

b'It will showcase local companies with their training programs.'
b'In addition, the shops of the downtown area will be invited to "Micro-Shopping".'

b'The Municipality and Chamber of Commerce are working together with the Industries Association.'
b'I\'m going to take the Gewerbeverein and the City in a further step of the project "Attractive City".'

b'The client\xe2\x80\x99s needs will be re-established or re-established.'
b'In addition to Kurg\xc3\xa4ste and Tourists.'
b'If even many locals had lost sight of the city when shopping, they would have lost sight of it.'
b"The end-residents would all have to contribute to the city's revitalization - from renters, the businesses of the whole city and clubs."
b'I gel with a network to overcome the lethargy that has been partly rooted out, had King said in spring.'

b'"Nobody knows how we\'re going to play in Aue," says his coach Friedman Funkel, yet Hoffmann is confident of his chances, "because we\'re just in the three-game stretch on the half-time lineup in Kaan Ayhan and Niko Gi'
b'"The prerequisite is, but, that we can harmonize better and we don\'t need to do so many apologies."'
b'It also takes Hoffman to Auburn to win the game.'
b"I suppose you can speak but after an unsuccessful start of a failed start, I don't know."
b'"That performance might be okay," Hoffmann said.'
b'"If we can come away with four points and focus on the playoffs, we will certainly be able to speak of a solid season."'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cOf course,\xe2\x80\x9d said his trainer. \xe2\x80\x9cI didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to know.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'"The start of the season is only after six to eight games," said Friedman Funkel, who doesn\'t want to speak of a advantage against Auburn just because the game of the Eagles in Heidenheim had to be cancelled due to an unfortunate incident.'
b'"Now they can start the season almost with a home game," Funkel said and Hoffman believes that the players from Auburn might be even more fresh as they wouldn\'t have had a hard and complete game like Fortuna against a playoff contender in the Knock.'
b'"Anyway they don\'t know as 100-percent where they are currently," says the defensive coordinator of the Jaguars.'
b'It was expected that the Eagles will go out as a light favorite on Sunday in the match in the finally (finally) completed stadium of Aue.'
b'"That we throw them away just because we have the potential to get under the first seat is bullshit," says Funkel, whose tally at just one loss against Auburn out of nine is certainly positive.'
b'"There is no team in the 2. Bundesliga that you have to beat from the start," says Fortuna\'s head coach.'
b'"Any such statement to make would be arrogant and overreaching".'
b'The sophomore will not be able to see his players on Sunday on a regular basis.'
b'The results of the Swedish Asthma test have been released'
b'The latest results of tests for asylum seekers in Sweden using a new method of medical assessment of their age suggest that more than 80 percent of the tested people are older than 18 years. But not everyone believes in the accuracy of the accurate data.'
b'The Swedish Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (RCDCD) began carrying out the tests last year.'
b'This will help during the asylum process the assessment of age more accurately, after the Swedish Migration Agency (MSA) was criticized for making mistakes in determining the correct age of some asylum seekers who were minors.'
b'This morning Migrationsverket sent 6.880 to test cases and the Forensic Medicine Agency has now released the results of the total of 2.844 tests from mid-March to July 2017.'
b'The majority (2002) were judged to be 18 or older, while in another 25 cases the Forensic Medicine Agency determined that the person was "probably 18 or older."'
b'The 432 cases was the conclusion that the person was "probably under the age of 18".'
b'The tests are performed only in cases where the age of the person is in question.'
b'In Johan G\xc3\xb6ransson of the Forensic Medicine Agency, the results have been consistent at the last few months.'
b'"We don\'t see a big difference in the statistics of the past few months, the numbers are pretty consistent," he told The Local.'
b'The high number of cases where the person was treated as over 18 means not necessarily that the asylum seeker has lied about his age.'
b'In May, the agency published the results of 581 tests and said that there were 443 cases that suggested that the examiner was 18 years or older.'
b'If the newspaper Svenska Dagbladet examined the 581 published results, it found that in 243 of these cases the person had offended that she was in this year\xe2\x80\x99s 18th century.'
b'The method of medical ageing, when scans of weak bones and MRI scans of bones are made, which are then examined by dentists and radiologists, has also been criticized in some areas.'
b'The Skeptic is the Endocrinologist Claude Marcus of the Karolinska Institute, whose work includes examining the genetic history of people to see if they were earlier or later than normal through puberty.'
b"I had reason to think about it, and I don't think the type of measurement should be used."
b'The biological age on this scale is very uncertain.'
b'"If we can\'t be sure, we shouldn\'t do as if we could," he told the newspaper Metro.'
b'Iansson of the Forensic Medicine Agency, however, defended the accuracy of the tests: "In general, you can say that the risk of a child being diagnosed as an adult is low.'
b'"The biggest risk is when the person is younger than 18, in this case this is roughly 10 percent."'
b"It's all in the plan"
b'The work on the three bridges of the landmark Highway 108 between Louth and Cheshire are well under way.'
b'It was installed a seven-foot-tall concrete bridge at the north-east corner of Lauterbach.'
b'"We\'re very good in time, it\'s going great," says Reinhold Leicht, engineer at the department of roads and transportation in the government of Freiburg.'
b'I started the work simultaneously on all three repaired bridges between Shrewsbury and Lauterbach.'
b'The construction is scheduled for October and Lee is confident that the timetable will be adhered to.'

b'The bridge at the town of Lauterbach has now been erected on the north side of the bridge a 1,500-foot-long and seven-tonne-thick so-called bridge.'
b'It is a Random Access Point that is also used as a business path.'
b'The southern part of the bridge will be used on Friday to install a 2,200-foot-long bridge.'
b'It will then be the pedestrian crossing.'
b'In particular, it is made of plastic, a patent of the Scottish company Dizwo.'
b'The other two bridges are already marked with the patented bridge markers.'
b'Their hands-on expertise has required the removal of cables through the construction site in Lauterbach.'
b'This is where there is also a fiber-optic cable that connects many companies.'
b'The residents were informed in advance of the work by hand-letters about the project.'
b'I had to first catch fish and sharks.'
b'The road between the construction site and the Sacred Heart Church is a pedestrian-friendly one-way street.'
b'In the construction of the bridge at Lake Lauterbach, the road in front of the bridge on the right-of-way between the hotels "Tannenhof" and "Sieben Linden" is completely blocked.'
b'The cost of the three bridge repairs amounts to $700,000.'
b'The whole thing is handled by the country.'
b'The DAD in Gersonville: Blessed Protest at American Carnival Foods'
b'I don\xe2\x80\x99t see it so often that parties come together at a gathering, but when it comes to the Alternative for America (AfD), it comes together, which is otherwise only hard to put under one roof.'

b'"The Easter Bunny remains bright".'
b'The City Picnic was originally scheduled to take place under the banner "All at one table" on the Brunswick Square, but now takes place on the parking lot below the roundabout - and thus right in front of those who attended the Affordable Care Act in the City Hall'
b'The busier picture that is offered there.'
b'"What Christa Karoli, founder of Forum One World and one of the most generous organisers, is right: "To see how many people have come here."'
b'"There\'s music and every kind of food, including a "urgent hamburger that even the AfD could eat easily," says the woman who brought him with her.'
b'The police have dispatched many officers to Gerolstein, they show presence mostly at the train station, which is just a few blocks away from the event venue.'
b'The Affordable Care Act is supposed to have come on Gerolstein?'
b'The Hompees of the Affirmative Action Campaign Vulcanicum reported that he has been asked to host such a meeting and received the invitation.'
b'The 45-year-old from G\xc3\xb6ttingen had initially come to Daun, where he received a cancellation because of the already built Laurentius Church\xe2\x80\x99s lack of parking spaces.'
b'This is also the rally, Hompes is pleased that "we can have such a nice event here".'
b'I look at the event on the roundabout, he says: "That\'s the good thing of the people, mainly it stays peaceful".'
b'It does it too: At 20 p.m. on the roundabout, a band will provide entertainment, in the city hall diverse speakers, including the rhetorical Republican U.S. Senator Uwe Young.'
b'The saloon is filled with about 200 attendees who wait for the top candidate for the U.S. Congress, Alice Weidel, and the Republican candidate for the U.S. Senate, Barack Obama, to hold their speeches.'
b'The police presence has been reduced, but previously the officers had a quiet night.'
b'I spent more than an hour attending the Affordable Care Act, the guests on the front have a longer aisle, but even there it is shortly after 21 p.m. on-site.'
b'The police can await - no special circumstances.'

b'I am Petkovic\xe2\x80\x99s soloist at the prestigious Royal Philharmonic in Amsterdam and Frederic Belli is soloist of the Symphony Orchestra of the Royal Philharmonic.'
b'It combines the desire to transcend not only the boundaries on their instruments, but also the boundaries of the different genres.'
b'I hear Johann Sebastian Bach at the two as in a new chorus, Daniel Schnyder\'s "Welcome to Bulgaria" mixes Bulgarian folk, and in the piece "Exchange Suite" of jazz-pianist Nils Wisdom, jazz and folk harmonies harmonize harmoniously.'
b'The core of the program was first performed this spring with huge success in Freiburg.'

b'I. The Democratic Governor of West Virginia, Jim Justice, announced Thursday at a rally with President Donald Trump that he will leave the party.'

b'In a country with only 15 governors and the control of the few constitutional body in history, the announcement of Governor Justice is only the last amendment to a party that is from top to bottom without leadership and is not in a position to make a positive, consensus-driven'
b'Thee loudly praises "evidence of Russia\'s responsibility for doping scandal'

b'"The entire committee and the entire Congress were pleased that the Russian Federation has recognized at once that it has experienced some pretty hot times and will do everything it can to ensure that the Federation is redesigned."'
b'Ie said he was also "excited" that Russia accepted the criteria for its restoration.'
b'"I think it was a very constructive day, and I think progress has been made, but the Congress supports the recommendations of the Task Force that this is not the moment to re-engage Russia again," Coe said.'
b'I have to do in the next few months everything I can to normalize this situation.'

b'In which Prince Henry will be buried, is yet to be determined.'
b'I did not have the intention of being placed in his French homeland.'
b'I never made a heap of sense that he was not happy with his title.'
b'The coronation of his wife Marguerite in 1972 would have made him gern king.'
b'I went into retirement and put down the title "Prince of Wales".'
b"In Denmark, Henrik didn't get the title and the function he wanted, he doesn't see himself being treated like his wife - even after her death, explained Lene Balleby, the chief executive of the Danish Royal Palace."
b'The final resting place of the 83-year-old is yet to be determined.'
b'I did not have the intention of being placed in his French homeland, but in Denmark.'

b'It said the redistricted state government now had to decide whether it could continue in this situation without majority.'
b'I Weil however believes it is imperative that the Landlord impose his self-determination.'
b'The Conservatives will be expected to vote on Tuesday about their next move.'
b'The state constitution also provides for the possibility that the Landlord loses the Minister\xe2\x80\x99s trust and chooses a replacement.'

b'The consumers can protect themselves.'
b'The minister is speaking in an interview with the editor-in-chief of Reporters Without Borders.'
b'The Schmidt, How can the consumer protect themselves from contaminated eggs?'
b'I can only encourage all consumers to look at the eggs in your refrigerator closely and check the scoop pressure.'
b'The consumer protection portal www.lifestylewarning.gov.uk will provide the states with the latest information about the affected eggs.'
b'The eggs should be discarded or returned.'
b'This, if after all we currently know, is virtually impossible.'
b'In fact, now Aldi is taking the best response - all eggs out of the offer - because the central role of the surveillance officer is not really taken seriously?'
b'The food safety is the responsibility of the state.'
b'I have alerted my house immediately and have been in contact with the authorities of the countries.'
b'The information and risk assessment are available for the consumer.'
b'The retailer has as well as the manufacturers to ensure that the sold products are safe and health-conscious.'
b'It is important to note that when eggs exceed the retention threshold of 0.05 mg/kg, these are not safe to consume.'
b'Aborted eggs may be sold and consumed.'
b"I don't think the businesses are blamed."
b'The manufacturing sector and consumers are in the same boat?'
b'It is currently believed that the production companies have no immediate responsibility.'
b'In addition, they must face illegal practices of service providers with economic consequences.'
b'I always find it inappropriate to have too few controllers.'
b"It's just about the personnel or even about the scheduling?"
b'It was just the amnesty controls that revealed the incident.'
b'The truth is however, that food fraud and criminal energy can never be tolerated to 100 percent.'
b'This is why a thorough investigation of such matters and the transfer of evidence to the courts in the cases where criminal charges may be filed are of paramount importance.'
b'I have already made it clear that I expect from the responsible authorities a lightening up.'
b'The regular alert to food poisoning is really necessary?'
b'The consumer has the right to receive exclusively safe and responsibly sourced food.'
b'The use of a non-tobacco product in the food industry is unacceptable to consumers.'
b'Ignoring the greedy means are manufacturers, retailers and consumers in a situation that is absolutely not necessary.'
b'This must be clear: The illegal use of the insecticide Fipronil in the care of livestock is not hinted at and must be stopped immediately.'
b'It must be done on all levels consistently and with high intensity.'
b'I expect from all concerned that the matter is promptly and thoroughly investigated.'
b'Influence of the financial rules of football on Neymar\xe2\x80\x99s move to Paris'
b'The rules aimed at preventing unnecessary spending by European football clubs will not interfere with Neymar\xe2\x80\x99s world record transfer from Spanish Barcelona to French Paris Saint-Germain.'
b'I don\xe2\x80\x99t think any constraints will come for Paris Saint-Germain from the UEFA yet, because the governing body that regulates the European game has the power to ban teams from accessing the prestige Champions League.'
b'The FIFA Fair Play Rules, introduced in 2011 by the UEFA, mean that Paris will eventually have to prove that the transfer of Neymar was made without major losses.'
b'The Brazilian has agreed to pay 222 million dollars (262 million $) to buy the Brazilian from his contract, and Neymar will receive a salary that will be several ten million dollars a year.'
b'This is some of the financial aspects of Neymar\xe2\x80\x99s move to France.'
b'I can withhold the money locked up so Neymar signs and brings him into a galaxy of other stars, at the expense of financing the team through the by the energy republic of Qatar.'
b'The NFL may be allowed to spend for the purchase of players much money, but must compete with legitimate income sources that allow them to make the break-even point in their on-the-go business.'
b'IFP was nominated by Michel Platini after his election to the UEFA presidency in 2007.'
b'The former French player believed that clubs who had in their pursuit of success taken enormous debts on their hands had effectively bet and risked losing money when banks or owners left their support.'
b'In 2011, FFP moved away from focusing on the debts of the clubs on tracking their losses.'
b'The change meant that the business model used by Roman Abramovich originally in Chelsea - a club with potential bought and then invested to improve the team and build a global brand - should be a tougher one.'
b'The current three-year FFP contract, which runs through 2018, can cause clubs losses in excess of $30 million.'
b'This year, although Platini has been dismissed from the presidency in disgrace, his UEFA native Alexis Ceferin continues to insist on being exempt from excessive spending.'
b'"Simple is FFP not dead and we will continue to strengthen the rules for the future," said Andrea Traverso, who is responsible for FFP, to The Associated Press in the past week.'
b'If the Paris Saint-Germain paid the buyout clause of Neymar in a flat fee, they can split the amount for accounting purposes over the duration of his contract.'
b'I have signed a five-year contract so the transfer fee can be paid for the next five years in the amount of $47,500 in the Annual Report.'
b'The first wave of FFP sanctions in 2014 left the Saints together with Abu Dhabi, which is in the possession of Manchester City, with the most severe sanctions.'
b"The Saints received a fine of $60 million (now $82 million), which was later reduced to $20 million - and it was ordered that the team's roster for the Champions League season 2014/15 be limited to 21 players instead of the otherwise normal 25 players."
b'The UEFA is on the lookout for clubs who could try to overwhelm its financial surveillance by raising their revenues through companies tied to the owners of a club.'
b'If a catastrophic company could sponsor the Paris Saint-Germain if the value of the sponsorship exceeded the standard mark-up, the UEFA would not consider this a legitimate income.'
b'This happened in 2014, when the UEFA ruled that the value of the sponsorship of the PSA was upheld by the Qatar Tourism Authority.'
b'I was informed that a portion of the PSG payments to Neymar could come via payments of the Organisation Committee of the FIFA World Cup in Qatar.'
b'The Paris Saint-Germain and Qatar 2022 have concluded that Neymar will be winning the World Cup and a derby could be easy for the UEFA regulators to find out.'
b'The recent sanctions against PSG means that the UEFA will be more careful about any attempt to violate the rules.'
b'The UEFA hadn\xe2\x80\x99t had any pre-game meetings with PSG about Neymar\xe2\x80\x99s transfer, said the people familiar with the situation.'
b'I spoke under the condition of anonymity with The Associated Press as they were not authorized to discuss the PSG situation.'
b'The latest published reports show that PSG 2015/16 made a profit of $542,475.'
b'The accounts for the last fiscal year must still be published.'
b"I expect that Neymar's arrival is a sequel to sponsorship deals, merchandising and jersey sales."

b'This leads to significant failures in asylum procedures.'
b'Immigration and Refugee Services Minister, Frank Weise, has pointed a media report to large gaps in the Immigration and Refugee Services Registry.'
b'Immigration irregularities in the U.S. could lead to asymmetry in asylum procedures and deportation decisions "sometimes resulting in grave mistakes," Weise warned in an analysis published by the "Sydney Morning Herald".'
b'In the register, according to the figures, there are ten million people with out-of-country citizenship, including about 5,7 million from non-EU countries.'
b'The data is collected by about 600 Australian authorities in the U.S.'
b'If the data had not been maintained adequately, the data quality in part had not been good.'
b'The individual cases were found to be data from 1921, "from people who are no longer alive, or from citizens who have become American citizens and should not have appeared in the register at all".'
b'"Fewer data inputs can significantly slow down return processes," according to the report.'
b'The statistics on out-of-country people included overseas EU citizens who wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t even have to travel.'

b'The Bank of England is likely to announce later that the interest rates will remain unchanged after the slowdown in economic growth and the drop in inflation have triggered speculation about an increase.'

b'This will require time for the financing plan to provide by the end of February cheaper financial aid for banks, although said that now is expected to provide 15 billion pounds more in the framework of this system - with 115 billion pounds sterling.'
b'"After the decision on inflation, the Bank said: "In the central forecast of the MPC, inflation remains temporarily low as the pressure on the real income of households continues to burden consumption."'
b'The inflation figures again suggested that "some sort of punishment of money policy" was needed to lower inflation and a "equal" amount of volatility would be needed as the markets expect.'
b'The market is currently forecasting the first increase in the third quarter of next year and a further in 2020.'
b'The bank insisted that increases would be "continuous" and "limited".'

b'It has its growth forecast to be at 1,8 percent in 2018.'
b'The pound fell after these news compared to the dollar and the euro.'
b'The pound fell 0.5 percent to 1,31 US cents and fell 0.3 cents to 1,11 cents.'

b'In the third quarter, growth is forecast to be at 0.3 percent, although it is likely to slow down after the bank\xe2\x80\x99s bankruptcy against the end of the year.'
b'The recent inflation report offered little hope for households affected by a rising inflation and low wage increases as the rising inflation will first make things worse before it gets better.'
b'It added that the money policy in the next few years cannot prevent the income downturn, but it believes that the wages will recover to the end of its three-year forecast.'
b'The economy is also boosted by the rising demand for British goods, which will compensate for the low PNB, which will compensate for a portion of lower consumption.'
b'The decision comes a year after raising the inflation target to zero percent in the last August after the swift EU referendum that caused the sinking of the pound.'
b'The bank estimates that it will likely take four years before this will reach the prices and economy completely.'
b'The recent ruling by the Bank on inflation was raising the prospect of inflation rising the pressure on hard-hit households, although three political decision-makers in July demanded an increase to 0.5 percent.'
b'The inflation rate is down from 2,9% in June to 2,9% in July, although the bank said this was expected and it will return to inflation in the coming months.'

b'The NHS will be able to access HIV treatment after a battle before the High Court over the funding of the drug in the NHS has forced access to a "transformative" HIV treatment program.'
b'The NHS England announced that a prescription prescription drug, which can reduce the incidence of HIV infection among high-risk patients by about 86 percent, has now been approved by the health department through a first three-year pilot study for HIV-positive patients.'
b'I explained that I was willing to pay for the trial after the appeals court had confirmed a ruling of the High Court that the NHS had the authority to pay for the PrEP despite the claim that the local governments had failed to pay for it.'
b'The amnesty was announced by NHS England chief Simon Stevens as a "willow new intervention," while the National Aids Trust called this an "important moment."'
b'It will include clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield, which will allow the registration of people, and additional clinics will be added in October, before it will be introduced in all England.'
b'It is a result of HIV prescription drugs taken before sexual intercourse to reduce the risk of HIV infection.'
b'It has been shown that PrEP reduces HIV transmission among HIV-infected individuals.'
b'IEP before sexual intercourse means that just enough drugs are present in the body of a person to prevent an HIV infection.'
b'The drug can be taken every day or so already two hours before sexual intercourse.'
b'The deceased persons eligible for treatment include gay or bisexual men, transsexuals and persons with HIV/AIDS who have not been successfully treated.'
b'The clinicians will identify suitable participants to participate in the study, including men, women, transsexuals and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status is not known to be controlled by antiretroviral therapy.'
b'If you live in England and are registered with a home-based sexual health clinic, you can also register for a possible participation in their local participating sexual health clinic.'
b'The program will cost \xc2\xa310 million and NHS England signed a contract to deliver the drugs in this week after an international competitive procurement.'
b'The study aims to assess the entire potential of PRP by collecting clinical evidence of how it is being used in large measures, taken and implemented.'
b'Is said: "This major new intervention should complement and overcome the broader and increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV infection.'
b'"This is another milestone in the more than three decades of progress in addressing one of the greatest health challenges facing humanity."'
b'This is a crucial moment in the fight against HIV.'
b'IEP, when it is targeted to vulnerable and disadvantageous people, offers the opportunity to change the English HIV epidemic.'
b'In September, people with high HIV risk will have access to this NHS-funded trial in England to develop a new instrument that is truly individualized and not subject to a negotiation with a partner, which will improve much, much more lives.'
b'"Thank you very much for this announcement."'
b'The Green, executive director of the Terrence Higgins Trust, said: "The priority has now to be placed on making sure the study is carried out quickly in the whole country and that no one who has a risk of HIV is left behind.'
b'"Now that the PrEP has been approved, we are on track to protect more than 10,000 HIV-positive people."'
b'The Hodgson, shadow health minister, said: "The start of the PrEP process is welcomed after months of delay and slow implementation by the government.'
b'The evidence shows how transformative this drug can be as part of our approach to HIV prevention and stop the transmission of this life-threatening infection.'
b'The experiment brings us a step closer to understanding the benefits of PRP.'
b"It is important that this study is carried out as quickly as possible in the whole country to protect people who are HIV-positive, and that it will contribute to making sure we're getting the stopping of HIV in society a step closer'."
b'The big life living: Downstairs and clever designer tricks have transformed this little Earls Court house into a spacious home'
b'Ine Leigh, an ex-banker with a passion for real estate, moved from a large house in Knightsbridge to an Earls Court apartment.'
b"It's located in the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne Terrace - and it's a testament to the new design that Joanne didn't pack her bags and sell them."
b'"I grew up with my ex in Knightsbridge in a much bigger house," says Joanne.'
b'I was looking for something that was comparable to my price.'
b'I was shown this house in Earls Court, and it had the same high ceilings.'
b'"I fell in love with her and made her an offer."'
b'The first inspection of the 1,000-square-foot house was completely overhauled.'
b'It was a one-story apartment with a discreet layout - you had to walk through the kitchen to enter the bedroom - Joanne wanted to add a stainless steel fireplace and an extension to maximize the generous deck height.'
b'I wanted high ceilings, large windows, lots of light.'
b'"That was my request," she says.'
b'The purpose of this project was to use the architectural and design studio Duck & Shed by Eran Azadi from Nottingham to create the 12,5 foot tall deck and create a home that was not only a development, but also a place to live for Joanne.'
b'The deck was not large enough to accommodate two rooms across, so the architectural challenge was to create an intermediate floor where you could stand.'
b'I needed to think creatively to solve the prerequisite.'
b'"The steelwork is pretty complicated," he explains.'
b'This meant we had to arrange the rooms so that they were stacked over each other without having to bounce.'
b'"It wasn\'t just about building a simple platform, but placing the steel so that it had for the function above or below the right height."'
b'The arrangement allowed Erfan to place two rooms in full width over each other - with lots of extra drama.'
b'The mid-terrace is a classic glass window of Retrouvius overlooking the glamorous living area.'
b'The mirrored gold ceiling, silk accents and vintage Serge Mouille lights set the tone for the program.'
b'The use of mirrors plays a role in adding theatre, space and light.'
b'The two engravings are a short crown to make it look longer.'
b'The kitchen feels like a window into a different room.'
b'The entrance offers geometry units space for all of the Bestecks and Gingerbreads of Joanne.'
b'The sense of a glamorous space can shut down the beauty of the living room when it is not used.'
b"I'm sorry, but flat-screen kitchens are nothing new."
b'The specialty of this is that it is a garage door.'
b'"A bit of engineering went into it," explains Erfan of the stainless steel, furnace-like MDF-tube.'
b'"It is against gravity, so it will gleam when you lift the door up very easily."'
b'The clefty use of space and staging allowed Joanne to gain additional 16 m2, a separate bedroom and a improved layout.'
b'"At the end of the day you will sell the ground - or how your property is valued," says Erfan.'
b'"In a rudimentary fashion, a real estate agent will appear and perform a calculation based on the floor size."'
b'It has allowed them to expand the floor space and use premium materials that give the space its luxurious edge.'
b'"The materials are the things that touch you and that therefore help create an emotional bond in a home," says Erfan.'
b"I don't love the electric sleeves in the walls."
b'"They are important, but they don\'t play with your heart."'
b'This shows that a home can be transformed by good design and increased square footage from something standard to something quite unique.'
b'I suppose as Joanne, you could decide not to leave these.'
b"I'm fighting for a $500 million property"
b'The twins are in trouble for four decades after their Italian family founded the dynasty, in an auction for one of the largest real estate holdings Victoria\xe2\x80\x99s in the U.S. in excess of $500 million.'
b"The former director of the 'CarltonFootball Club' and developer Colin De Lutis lives in a villa in Toorak, just three doors from his younger brother Paul. This has brought him to the Supreme Court to determine how their relationship has deteriorated."
b'I wanted to retire from the family business, but a fierce battle over separation takes place in the upper courtroom.'
b'In addition to her mother Anna, the twins own 38 properties worth more than $1 million, accumulated since the family purchased a business in the Smith Street, Collingwood, in 1973.'
b'The family founded Westco Jeans and grew to a chain of 160 retail stores.'
b'It was sold in 1999 for 85 million dollars.'
b'The money was invested in real estate, and the portfolio of De Lutis now includes offices in the city centre, the developments of Brunswick and Sorrento, the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Buller as well as shopping malls in the surrounding area.'
b'In a deal with her deceased father, Colin - described by Paul as "the chief executive officer and the dominant personality" in the family of De Luttis - owns about two thirds of the company\'s assets and Paul about one third.'
b'The court ruled that this means that Colin owns property worth 316 million dollars and Paul is worth 176 million dollars.'
b'The separation of property and bargaining has been a problem for Paul.'
b'"The of Colin\'s proposals have left him with what I thought were the best objects," he wrote 2015 in a first Affidavit.'
b'This past Friday after several failed vow renewals, the first hearing of the Supreme Court was held.'
b'The brothers now fight for control of the existing business - whereas Colin, as Paul claims, has been excluded.'
b'I argument that this is not true, but weakens Paul\xe2\x80\x99s ability to manage some belongings inappropriately.'
b'The early affidavit, which was filed by Colin, says he hopes to settle the dispute.'
b'"My Italian heritage states that the family is the most important priority," he wrote.'
b'The cost rises in the case, with hundreds of pages with Affidavits, emails and reports from companies, including Deloitte, Pitch Partners and Charter Keck Cramer, and with leading lawyers, including Allan Myers, QC.'
b'The deceased and her widowed husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who ran dairy bars and dessert shops from the late 1950s and in the early 1960s bought a business in Brunswick.'
b'I used the security to buy the Collingwood estate, in which Colin opened the first Jeans shop of the family.'
b'"He says he started Westco there when he was "in my last years of high school when Paul was still a little boy (about 10 years old)."'
b'The deceased says that she and Luigi, who died in 2012, hoped to pass their property to their sons.'
b'"Luigi often said to me that he never wanted the twins to land before trial," she wrote.'
b'The other brothers, Mark and Luke, are no longer part of the De Lute Group, although Colin claims Mark paid at the time of leaving the company 10 million dollars and Luke paid 26 million dollars.'
b'The twins, Lukas and Mark, are, as Paul says, "about the conditions of their financial separation."'
b'It has been very back-to-back since he was a former AFL vice-president and according to a memoir from 2015, Eddie McGuire was the best friend of the television star.'
b'Iffax Media took contact with Colin and Paul De Lutis and their agents.'
b'The Colin responded by text to say "I really can\'t say much because the case is before the courts."'
b'"It is very, very sad that my brother Paul decided to bail me out and pull our family name through the courts," he wrote.'
b'The 2016 Colin wrote in a letter to the court that he tried to fulfill the demands of his brother.'
b'"Unfortunately, my father would not have wished that Paul and I would end up in our current dispute," he said and added that he "is still hopeful of a resolution".'
b'The Friday seemed to pass this hopelessness.'
b'"Unfortunately, our case will be solved in the near future by the courts," wrote Colin.'
b'Its new secretary of state plans to restrict media access to the president.'
b'I have tried it and have failed.'
b"I can't believe John F. Kennedy could actually do it."
b'If yes, he will be the first.'
b'Theo reports that the new chief of staff of the White House is planning to limit the information flow on President Donald Trump - including the reports of the news media - in order to keep the chief on a same-day schedule.'
b'The following is a piece by Reporter Josh Dawson:'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cWhen John F. Kelly, the new chief of staff of the White House, arrived at his first meeting with senior officials, he presented a major problem in President Donald Trump\xe2\x80\x99s White House that he wanted to fix: bad information that was inaccurate,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.'
b'"He told the staff that information about him should flow - whether on paper or in briefings - because the president would make better decisions if he had good information."'
b'Its diagnosis makes sense, but others have tried to kill Trump by monitoring his media diary.'
b'The Trump relationship with television dates back decades - and now, where he is in the White House, his television advertising is still strong.'
b'"When candidate Trump was criticized for an unfair reporting practice, it was productive to show him that he received a fair reporting of positions that were to be convinced," former candidate Sam Nunberg said in February to Politico.'
b'Theos Tara Palmeri wrote to the Times that "the key to keeping Trump\'s Twitter habit under control, according to six former presidential candidates, is to ensure that his personal media consumption includes a steady loneliness."'
b'............................'
b'The idea that Trump\'s Twitter habit has ever been "under control" is ludicrous.'
b"I know these campaign officials know something we don't know others - that Trump's tweets without their interventions would have contained even more bullshit."
b'I will likely never know anything about the tweets that Trump didn\xe2\x80\x99t send.'
b'If he and his staff have been able to make it work some times to prevent anger from coming out of him, then their efforts have been rewarded.'
b'It hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been deliberate that Trump provokes controversy.'
b'The part of the problem is that the people in a White House that is composed of competing parties are always trying to advance their own agenda by presenting Trump material that may encourage their views from the world.'
b'Theo - quite familiar with this story - reported in May about the preference of the advisers to send the president out of strategic necessity corrupt information.'
b'I was given an example that was described by Reporter Shane Goldman:'
b'The AAP and former Trump administration officials say that Trump can act like a vulture on negative press clips, especially those with damaging leaks, and that he is secretly trying to figure out where these come from.'
b'The incident occurred last February, when someone threatened the president with a copy of GotNews.com, the website of Internet Provider Charles C. Johnson, who accused the Vice-Chairman Katie Walsh of being a spy.'
b'In Johnson\xe2\x80\x99s case, he was suspended temporarily from Twitter or that he offered no specific evidence or that he made false statements and they were refuted.'
b'"I read the article and favoured asking staff about Walsh."'
b'In addition, the former secretary of state, Reince Priebus, and the general secretary of the White House, Rob Porter, "required to implement a system to manage the paperwork and recordkeeping that Trump receives".'
b"I'm sorry, didn't that work out?"
b'I tried three months later to do the same.'
b'I will see him as a more effective manager than Priebus, but Trump is still his impulsive self, and his advisers continue to look for influence.'
b'This uncertainty makes Kelly\xe2\x80\x99s mission very difficult.'
b'The most wanted criminals get mail from Europol'
b'If the address is unknown, the involvement of the community will be appreciated and appreciated.'
b'The police in all of Europe are sending (virtual) postal mail to dangerous criminals on the run.'
b'If the identifiers of the searched criminals are naturily not known, anonymity will be encouraged and encouraged.'
b'Ifpol reported on Friday of the campaign, which follows the "EU Most Wanted" ad campaign from winter.'
b'The experiences had shown that many fraudsters were secretive at holiday destinations, according to Europol.'
b'I have collected 21 postal addresses for searched suspects from 21 EU countries.'
b'The 2016 website www.eumostwanted.com has been viewed more than 2.5 million times.'
b'In the online investigations, at least nine suspects have been arrested, at least eight of them because of evidence after the closure of the website.'
b"I negotiate over a grave and return to 'Millionaire'"
b'The most well-established houses of the West Midlands are standing again with some enthusiastic travellers on battlefield, who have negotiated a from the community stolen grave to secure a field before their estates.'
b'The travelers parked their 20 homestead vehicles on a field outside a well-established road from Solihull, which is known as the "Million Dollar Road."'
b'I have horses, babies and an army of transport vehicles with me after they were released in May, without being threatened by a from the Rat ratified graveyard to prevent their intrusions.'
b'The taker group found a gap in the defense and pushed their vehicles through a section that was unable to find a way.'
b'In the meantime, residents have threatened the councillor of Solihull, who said it was "necessary to deal with the issue".'
b'The anonymous resident said: "They arrived on Monday night after being sent from Bentley Heath, where they threw rocks on the passengers.'
b'The Rat must be forced by shame to implement in the first place as he was nuts at dealing with the problem.'
b'The travellers were there in May, were further travelled and are now back.'
b'"They arrived yesterday evening, likely today."'
b'I added: "The Mayor of Birmingham knows how to deal with it by holding long-term subscriptions to protect their parks.'
b'"I live on the Street Brook Road and I\'m not happy to continue paying my council tax if the council can\'t stop that."'
b'The anchor, who did not want to be named, said: "It\'s ridiculous, we just saw the last round of these travelers, just to be bombed by another round.'
b'"The numbers have risen this year and you even saw a horse in the park."'
b'The spokesman for the Council of Solihull said: "We are aware of an unknown camp on the land just off the Streetsbrook Road and work with the police of Solihull. We will take the necessary legal steps to make sure they are as quickly as possible."'
b'If you want to support our evidence collection, it is very important that EVERYONE who notices an anti-social or criminal behavior can report it to the police by calling 101.'
b'"This helps to create a picture of the situation in which the court has to consider when we file our case."'
b"The bird's nest will be Waldhotel Luise"
b'The former hotel Birkenhead will be transformed into the Forest Hotel Luise.'
b'The house near the gates of Freudenstadt is currently being renovated and will be opened on March 1st next year.'
b'This is good news for the city.'
b'It was with the closing of the hotel Birkenhead by the former Ambiente Betriebsgesellschaft mbH to April 2014 that its revenues were lost to about 30,500 nights per year and even revenues from the Kurtzberg tax.'
b'The fall of 2014 saw dramatic increases in the number of asylum seekers coming to the county, which offered the hotel building to the Land Board as a saving grace, which caused controversy.'
b'The city prevented the arrival of asylum seekers by putting up a pedestrian crossing to secure the area as a hotel.'
b'The decision was never made in the council\xe2\x80\x99s deliberation.'
b'The former Freudenstadt Mayor Julian Osborne defended the hotel and spoke already of serious interest in the property.'
b'I should have been right.'
b'The group Luisen Hotels with headquarters in Bad Bergzabern has acquired the former hotel Birkenstock at a voluntary auction in Berlin and wants to make it a house of the three-star luxury category under the name Waldhotel Luise.'
b'The group has with the Happy Valley property four houses.'
b'It is one in Bad Bergzabern and one in Bad Herrenalb.'
b'I hei\xc3\x9fen Hotel Luise, Luise Park, Park Hotel Luise and now Waldhotel Luise.'
b'The former hotel Birkenhof has been standing for a long time construction containers near the entrance, and when you enter the house, you will be able to see the extent to which major renovations have been undertaken.'
b'The walls were removed, decks topped up, old bathrobes removed from the rooms.'
b'The entire hotel is a single building.'
b'I still have a lot to do.'
b'"It\'s actually a nice hotel," says Tom Scherer in an interview with our newspaper.'
b'It should be restored to its black-and-white look.'
b'The rooms will be equipped with large beamed bathrooms, the entrance will be renovated, there will be new windows installed.'
b'I should later be "pretty bourgeois," as Thomas Scherer put it.'
b'"We want to make a necklace."'
b'The sauna, steam room and a meeting room are included in the amenities.'
b'I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to be on the high side of the hotels in Lauterbach, yet already on a high street level, says Scherer.'
b'The Forest Hotel Luise with its about 60 rooms wold be breitled across the country, according to Scherer.'
b'If you are a single traveler, groups or business traveller, you should feel comfortable in the hotel.'
b'In meetings with OB Julian Osborne and Tourism Minister Michael Krause, he has already been appointed, according to Scherer.'
b'The vision of the city was deceptively similar to that of the hotel group.'
b'"We are on the same line."'
b'Ignoring the amount of the investments asked for, Thomas Scherer doesn\xe2\x80\x99t want to know exactly.'
b'In under a million dollars, he reckons.'
b'The exteriors are being put on hold, which is already evident.'
b'It will create a large patio that will be accessible from the restaurant, which is public.'
b'"Scherer is optimistic: "French is a good market".'
b'A-Affairs: US Special Counsel sets Grand Jury aside'
b"The Russia investigation into Donald Trump's allegations that Special Counsel Robert Mueller has been used after a report aspired to be a Grand Jury."
b'The committee has taken up the work, the "Wall Street Journal" reported, citing with the matter familiar persons.'
b'The newspaper considered the move as a sign that Mueller\xe2\x80\x99s investigation has been expanded and intensified.'
b'The Sender CNN reported that there had already been first advances of the committee in relation to a meeting between Trump\xe2\x80\x99s older son and a Russian official.'
b'The Kremlin has been accused of targeting Hillary Clinton in the 2016 presidential election.'
b'The investigation examines whether there were compromises between Trump\xe2\x80\x99s campaign and Moscow.'
b'The investigation will involve several men who served in the campaign as advisers to the Republican candidate.'
b'This week, Mueller also took more closely Trump\xe2\x80\x99s private and business life under his wing.'
b'The "Washington Post" wrote earlier this week that the Special Counsel has been personally in touch with Trump and the accusation underscores whether the president in the course of the investigation could have harmed the Justice Department.'
b'The main task of Grand Jury is to examine evidence in potential criminal cases and determine whether to file charges.'
b'The Jurys are therefore referred to as appellate courts.'
b'It is common for them to be acted upon when it comes to larger and controversial cases.'
b'The procedure is always carried out behind closed doors.'
b'The committee may also be appointed by the court to invite persons to appear under oath.'
b'The broadcaster has already released previews of the encounter between Donald Trump Jr. and a Russian agent.'
b'I, who was at the meeting, was asked to make a statement, according to the report.'
b'I should be able to provide documentation.'
b'The Trump Jr. was also Trump\xe2\x80\x99s adviser and son-in-law Jared Kushner as well as his daddy Paul Manafort at the meeting.'
b'The expert said on Thursday night in the U.S. televised show that the assault showed Mueller was not ashamed of his work and that he would, if needed, act quickly.'
b'It mustn\xe2\x80\x99t be said that the Grand Jury will be called at the end of the trial to decide about the issue of an appeal.'
b'The appointment of the committee is the start of a new phase in the investigation and a new reason for concern for President Donald Trump.'
b'Ignoring the new revelations, the president used a speech in West Virginia to portray the Russia case as a campaign of his political opponents.'
b'"The Russia\'s history is a complete inventory," Trump said.'
b'"This issue gives the Democrats a chance to feel "silent because they have nothing else they can talk about".'
b'The Special Counsel Ty Cobb said in a statement that he didn\xe2\x80\x99t know anything about a Grand Jury.'
b'I work but also normally in secret, he insisted.'
b'The White House welcomes any measures that would speed up the work of the Special Investigator on "fair" terms.'
b'The former FBI director James Comey has said three times that he will not be investigated against the president.'
b'I have no reason to believe that anything has changed, I said in the statement.'
b'I was aber erst chosen after Trump had resigned.'
b'It was this racket that sparked controversy against Trump, he wanted to impeach the Justice Department.'
b'Iy said in June before a Senate committee that Trump had asked for a suspension of investigations into the former national security adviser Michael Flynn.'
b'The president is under intense scrutiny because of the investigation.'
b'The report cited US media collected material against the Special Counsel and its staff.'
b'Ignited speculation as to whether Trump wanted Mueller to resign.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cAs an independent Special Counsel of Congress such as in the Watergate scandal surrounding the later resigned president Richard Nixon, Mueller has a position in which he could be the subject of interrogation on behalf of the president from the Justice Department,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.'
b'The Senators at both parties want to prevent a such move but are concerned.'
b'The group of Republican and Democratic Senators presented on Thursday legislative proposals after which the special counsel could no longer be allowed to resign so easily.'
b'Insurrection: Giant Elephant is trapped in the Antarctic'
b'The West Antarctic has become a gigantic island of the roughly seven times the size of New York City from the shakes.'
b'The Bremerhaven-based Alfred Hitchcock Institute for Polar and Marine Sciences said Tuesday that it is working on a pilot project.'
b'The over a billion-pound and 5,500-square-mile-long asteroid is now heading north and will probably need two, three years to be destroyed.'
b'This is with 175 miles of ice and a depth of up to 50 miles, one of the largest glaciers that scientists have recorded in the past three decades.'
b'The danger for people does not go away from him.'
b'The extent to which climate change has played a role in the erosion of the asteroid, according to researchers, is unclear.'
b'It has been known for about 30 years to be a series of unusual collisions of snowflakes in the region, writes the U.S. Center for Snow and Ice Conservation in a fact sheet.'
b'The consensus among scientists is that this could be linked to climate change.'
b'The now abated skeleton was previously a part of Larsen C Sculpture.'
b'Ilfeis swims on the coast and is surrounded by large glaciers.'
b'The whale is therefore continuing to wave in the ocean and bounces regularly.'
b'The Larsen C cavity is located north-east of South America almost at the bottom of the Antarctic Peninsula.'
b'The northern part of this valley had suffered from the balance of wheat and almonds for some years.'
b'The entire cavity has been sealed there, writes AWI researcher Daniela Jansen.'
b'This spree suggests that even the Larsen C squadron is in danger, because the front of the squadron has never been as far back as currently.'
b'The Ice Plate is steadily under pressure and could break down if at a keyhole a piece breaks.'
b'The melting of sharks and eaves does not increase the sea level as they swim on the water and evaporate as much water as it does after the melting itself.'
b'It also leads to the loss of the cherry blossoms, which can flood the Gulf right into the sea and much faster than before.'
b'I could possibly increase the sea level, though only in a small way, writes the British research project to monitor the Antarctic.'
b'The Larsen C cavity is estimated to be the largest cavity in Antarctica with almost 50 square kilometers, making it the fourth largest cavity in the world.'
b'The crossing is up to 700 feet thick, at the front of the freezing lake about 200 feet.'
b'I bounce it regularly.'
b'"Obviously it is a natural occurrence and we are not aware of any direct link to climate change, the glacier is now in a vulnerable position," said Martin O\'Leary of the British Swansea University.'
b'"That\'s the farthest rebound since beginning the recordings," he confirmed.'
b'"The scientists are concerned about whether the Larsen C cavity will now grow or gradually decline and may collide," said his colleague Adrian Luckman and added: "Our models say it will be less stable".'
b'I expect this development will take years.'
b'If these scientists don\xe2\x80\x99t blame the collapse of this gigantic ice cap on climate change, in recent years, there have been very few ice caps of the Antarctic Peninsula.'
b'The longest zip line of the Antarctic Peninsula stretches north toward South America.'
b'The data of the research programme British Antarctic Survey is showing that the ice extent of the Antarctic Peninsula has fallen by 28 percent since 1950.'
b'The rebound has contributed to the temperature increase.'
b'The Antarctic Peninsula has risen in the past 50 years by about three degrees and is considered to be one of the areas where the temperature rises most rapidly.'
b'I want home-care at the expense of the Personal'
b'It is becoming more difficult to fill flexible jobs, the union is asking the union to retire from the employer body to make it more attractive.'
b'The shortly before the summer, the county has created 41 new jobs in the administration.'
b'The more than 1100 staff and volunteers are working for the county government in Mettman.'
b'I have yet to see any of my 17-year-olds get their first job behind them.'
b'The teaching positions at the county are apparently very competitive.'
b'The 620 applications were received for the incumbent positions.'
b'The county needs to retain further personnel to meet the rising demands and tasks.'
b'In the county Mettman, there are as yet 50 not filled positions.'
b'Immigration officers include doctors and engineers as well as forces of general administration.'
b'The CDU wants to now work together with the FDP and the UWG to take the initiative and address the staff shortage in the department.'
b'The administration is to develop after the wishes of the parties "a plan to recruit and retain staff".'
b'This is to not only meet shortage of skilled workers, but to counteract the recruitment shortage, it says.'
b'The overall plan should be based on internal and external factors, include concrete measures for Quebecers on the job and include a training initiative, rejected by Democrats, FDP and U.S. Senators.'
b'I hear it sounds like a good idea.'
b'I think the circle has to do with personal problems you used to not know so well.'
b'The cities are seeking good candidates and applicants abroad and offering more attractive pricing.'
b'I speak of a regulated "Writer\'s Guild of Public Employees".'
b'It comes with a high number of staff who are retired or age-related.'
b'The time has come to act also, so that no more positions remain unfilled.'
b'This week, Kevin V\xc3\xb6lker, VP of the Democratic Party, is going with his party still over the joint petition.'
b'It was unveiled unveiled in the county council for a faint moment when he questioned the personnel allowance and the remaining parties.'
b'I want to ensure that all options are reviewed to allow a retirement from the municipal employer union.'
b'"If we don\'t get here quickly to a satisfactory solution, the county should negotiate with the unions - perhaps in consultation with the county\'s cities - a house tax," says V\xc3\xb6lker.'
b'The Conservatives are trying to pay the agents and officers better than what the Tariff Regulation for the public sector actually requires.'
b'The salaries are currently fixed, increases or more money are available only when you move to a higher grade level that corresponds to your career.'
b'The role of the county has become more important in recent years.'
b'This past week, new spaces had to be installed in order to ensure that agents comply with the provisions of the new Prostitution Protection Act.'
b'In recent years, due to the rising number of asylum seekers, Landlord Thomas Henderson and County Commissioner Martin Richter have a problem: They have too little staff.'
b"I've changed the tone to NGO Migrant Refugee Refugee Refugee Refugee Refugee Refugee Refugee Refugee Refugee Refugee Refugee Refugee Refugee Refugee Refugee Refugee Refugee Ref"
b'The NGO has warned NGOs that use emergency vessels for migrants in the Mediterranean that they cannot continue this operation if they do not hold themselves to new rules for their operations.'
b'"If NGOs don\'t sign a new behavioral code, it\'s difficult to see how they can continue to work," said Interior Minister Marco Minniti in an interview with the Turin-based newspaper La Stampa.'
b"Thenitis warning came a day after the Italian authorities detained a boat of the German aid group 'Juvenile Rescue' because its crew had effectively cooperated with human traffickers in a way that helped the illegal arrival."
b'The humanitarian organization, which has only been in operation for a year, refused to respond to detailed allegations made by Italian prosecutor Ambrogio Cartosio.'
b'"For us, the survival of human beings is and remains our highest priority. It is therefore very regrettable that we are not able to operate in the search and rescue zone," the organization said in a statement to the social media.'
b'"We can investigate all accusations that are currently being made, only after we have collected all information and assess the situation."'
b"The Italian authorities had guarded the boat of 'Juvenile Rescue', the Iuventa, since October."
b'It is believed that its crew will take scuba dive mining vessels that are supplied to them directly by human traders, and that the scuba dives can be shut down so the vessels can be used again.'
b'In fact, a such meeting was supposed to have taken place apparently only 1,3 miles north of the Libyan coast, according to the affidavit of the prosecutor, whose content was published by Italian media.'
b'The beast is suspected of being overseen by the authority of the Italian Coast Guard, which monitors the evacuation operations in the zone from humanitarian reasons and not from any other motive.'
b'The behavioral code requires boats like the Iuventa to have at least one Italian police officer on board that monitors their activities.'
b'The three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue operations have yet to sign up to the code: Save the Children, MOAS from Malta and Pro-Access Open Arms from Spain.'
b'Ire said on Thursday that the new rules would be regarded as unnecessary, but acceptable as they would not bring any "significant changes or limitations" to their evacuation operations.'
b'The defenceless who refuse to sign are the Nobel Prize-winning organization Medical Students Without Borders (MSF).'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cNowadays, the number of migrants arriving after the evacuation operations in Italy has fallen sharply,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, adding that the efforts to strengthen the licensing of Libyan Marines and the cooperation with the rescue operations have been limited.'
b'"In recent days, we have started seeing light at the end of the tunnel," said the minister.'
b'It also announced plans for further meetings with Libyan officials in this month to discuss economic development initiatives and with Tunisia, Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants leaving these countries in the hope of reaching Europe.'
b'Influence and Triggers of the Environment'
b'Then Weilermer bicyclists, the "Berliner Au\xc3\x9fenposten" and two guest drivers arrived in Wachenheim in the north to enjoy four days of triathlons and sightseeing.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cThere were three bespoke guides available.'
b'The lodge in the Wachai Valley proved to be a good starting point for the tours.'
b'The Burgundy and Wine Festival of Wachai was a welcomed extravagance.'
b'The first tour took place at hot summer temperatures along the vineyard to the Michael\xe2\x80\x99s Chapel above Devon.'
b'The following were views, partly on doors, from which you could see farther than the plains and the surrounding hills.'
b'I noticed that there were always longer trials, for the long trials.'
b'The second day we headed to Bad D\xc3\xbcrkheim for the Sausage Festival and the Volksfest Wurst Market.'
b'I ran from viewpoint to viewpoint, connected by "flowing" triangles and moderate increases.'
b'In the last two days, there were again many hills to be climbed.'
b'The hills, walls, castles, ruins and avenues brought welcome breaks.'
b'This morning, the bicyclists at the outdoor indoor spa treated the sore throat.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cNew York City has been taxed.'
b'The 173 miles and nearly 4500 miles of climbing had the group seen the Peak District from its best - physically and spiritually.'
b'Inequality instead of Rasputin - Bundesliga gears up for E-Sports'
b'The sports stars will be forced to compete against computers, instead of battling through wind and rain over the stadium grass?'
b'The fact is: E-sports has become a serious business, to a lucrative business - big stars, millions of fans and huge tournaments with high gamers included.'
b'I have also noticed that the first Bundesliga clubs are becoming increasingly involved in this area.'
b'I started 2015 with the Yankees, followed by the Yankees 04 and lastly the Yankees, who started a eSports team in July and took two players for the computer game FIFA 17 under his wing.'
b'"We hope to attract and retain a lot of new young audiences for the VBS," says chairman Jochen R\xc3\xb6ttgerman.'

b'The ex-manager of Chelsea and Manchester City now owns an agency for virtual football players.'
b'"The real football needs to be especially concerned with the 14- to 30-year-olds, that the young people will continue to go in," says the 52-year-old.'
b'I: The clubs tried to dominate all possible markets, especially the Asian ones.'
b'The prominent e-sports players under contract could be online far more frequent on these markets than just once a year sending the Bundesliga team to Asia.'
b"I'm confused. What's it all about?"
b'The E-sports industry is dominated by computer games like "League of Legends", "Dota 2", "Country Strike Force" or just the football simulator FIFA on competition level.'
b'The NHL has established, as in regular-season sports, leagues in which the professional teams compete against each other.'
b'The Asian Games 2022 are already part of the official program.'
b"I'm wondering if it's even a proper sport?"
b'I think many are sure to be shocked at the prospect.'
b'Ingo Frob\xc3\xb6se has long been concerned with the issue.'
b'The professor at the Royal College of Physical Education said E-sport is a sport because it is compulsory and shows many biological and physiological reactions that you can find in traditional sports - such as increased heart rate, stress responses, hormonal changes.'
b'I need cognitive abilities, a technical and tactical understanding and a quick response.'
b'If you\xe2\x80\x99re a gamer, you shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t just play at the console, but also train your body and focus on diet.'
b'"The fittest player is a good player."'
b'Ibose looks at problems: "Doctoring is becoming more of a concern".'
b'The game mechanics were difficult to follow, and in the scene were missing the structures of traditional sports.'
b'The researchers point out the high integrative effect of E-sports.'
b'The players are international, which is like having a big global family, there are no inter-cultural barriers.'
b'The study commissioned by Deloitte and the National Association of Interactive Entertainment Software says the e-sports industry is predicting a rapid growth.'
b'This would have translated to $50 million, mostly through advertising, sponsorship and large tournaments.'
b'The three-year revenue goal is to be at 130 million.'
b'I think the roughly $2.1 billion of the football league is that little.'
b'"The e-sports industry is no longer far from the other established sports such as baseball, basketball or soccer," Deloitte writes.'
b"I'm sure many countries are already moving forward."
b'The biggest markets are Asia and the U.S., where ex-baseball star Shaquille O\xe2\x80\x99Neal and baseball legend Alex Rodriguez are joining the US team NRG eSports.'
b'I-Star Ashton Kutcher is investing in the e-sports brand Unicorn.'
b"I'm in Europe doing some research."
b'\xe2\x80\x9cIn a Norwegian school, E-Sport has been introduced as a curriculum,\xe2\x80\x9d Frob\xc3\xb6se says.'

b'I Carter for the lyrics that drove Conrad Roy to suicide'
b'The woman from Massachusetts was sentenced to two years in jail because she encouraged her friend through texts and calls to suicide.'
b'The Carter, now 20, will spend 15 months of her sentence behind bars and five years on bail.'
b'I was sentenced in June for faking Conrad Roy, who died on July 13, 2014.'
b'The father of Roy said on Thursday at the hearing: "My family is unhappy.'
b'"My son was my best friend."'
b'I was allowed to stay until the profession.'
b'I was sentenced to a maximum of 20 years, but her lawyers argued that both I and Mr Roy suffered from a mental illness.'
b'The red dress and a creme-colored bow tie, Carter stood there with tears in her eyes, with broken hands and downward looking eyes when she was arrested.'
b'"Ireland\'s actions have killed Conrad Roy," the prosecutor told the court.'
b'It ended her life to make her own better.'
b'"No one has taken responsibility," she said.'
b'"She hasn\'t shown any restraint".'
b'"Catherine\'s lawyer said it was a "ridiculous circumstance, which she completely regrets".'
b'The Lawrence Moniz said however, he did not find that her "age or reluctance or even her mental health have a significant impact on her actions".'
b'I read a statement from Roy\'s mother Lynn Roy, who stated that there is "no day I will not betray the loss of my beloved son."'
b'"I want to make sure he is proud of me and how I deal with everything. I want to, despite all my pain we will carry for the rest of our lives with us, be there for his sisters," it says.'
b'Their sister, Camdy Roy, said she would be "vindicated" that she would never be able to attend the wedding of her brother or be a nanny for his children.'
b'"No longer having that one person I have been with since my birth every day is a pain I will always remember for the rest of my life," she said.'
b'The case seems to be a legal punishment, as there is no law in Massachusetts that makes it a crime to force another to commit suicide.'
b'I was 17 years old when Roy was found dead in 2014 of a cocaine poisoning in a vehicle.'
b'The case sparked national attention after Carter\xe2\x80\x99s text messages revealed that she had encouraged him to end his life.'
b'"Hush up, spring from a building, first you yourself, I don\'t know, there are many ways," she said in several messages she had sent in the two weeks before his death while he was with his family in Greece.'
b'"In the midst of his suicide, Conrad wrote: "You have to do it, Conrad" and "All you have to do is turn off the generator and you will be free and happy."'
b'The Monarch said that Carter was seeking attention by the death of Roy and ordered that she should be benefited by any press coverage of the case.'
b'The case has shared the legal opinion.'
b'The few who defended Carter included Amanda Knox, who was sentenced in 2007 for murdering her British cousin in Italy, before being released two years later.'
b'The Knox, 30, posted in the Los Angeles Times a comment: "Michelle Carter deserves compassion and help, not arrest."'
b'The Kimmich: Learning from the new mini-Lacey of the FC'
b'The fact that Joshua Kimmich appeared at the Audi Cup as the captain is no surprise.'
b"I'm tracing the Confederate Cup to a big season - extra motivation doesn't hurt there."
b'It was there differently on his spot in the cabin, which saw Joshua Kimmich immediately, even though the extra clothing was very, very small.'
b'If there was far and away at the second day of the Audi Cup obviously no Philip Lahm and even no Manuel Neuer to be seen, he made sure to get the him tossed bit at the arm.'
b'"The coach hasn\'t announced it," the Confederate champion told reporters behind the scenes, after his first appearance as a Rangers captain.'
b'I, the Eint would have run better than 0-0 against the SSC Neapel.'
b'The sign of the coach could have been Kimmich too descriptive.'
b'The eight-year-old Arturo Vidal was chosen in the out of juniors, defenceman and just out of the holidays to join the C-League as playmaker, but he.'
b'Thel you may want to distribute to those you care about that you want to keep at Laughter.'
b'If you have also been chosen to attend the event of Lahm, you can use a little extra motivation just fine.'
b'"Mich confirmed: "That\'s what you want to do as a player: take responsibility".'
b'This past Tuesday, the 22-year-old ran as a mini-lap over the field.'
b'I hint, this is now his position, the white ribbon at the arm did its utmost.'
b'The \xc3\xbcberhaupt appeared to be Kimmich in this start as the one who can take the Rude as well.'
b'I gave instructions, trying to control the uneasy crowd.'
b'I had the eye for the whole thing while many others were busy with themselves.'
b'In order to overcome his lack of fitness (didn\xe2\x80\x99t seem to); Renato Sanches trying to catch on to the performances of the Asia trip (didn\xe2\x80\x99t even belong); and Sebastian Rudy and Niklas Syle trying to fit in their first performance'
b'I always thought it was going to work quite well.'
b'I ran along with Kimmich, Rudy before the attack, both acting souverantly.'
b'The namically-designed Napoli striker did frequently struggle, while Scully was also trying to be successful in the play-offs a few times.'
b'The colleague Rudy admitted that the result was "not as we hoped".'
b'I also saw him show off a solid performance.'
b'Iverson, Tempo change: "For this style I was picked up too."'
b'The ungewist nature of this FCW still exists for the newcomers, you saw in the aftermath of the game.'
b'They for example did not give in the catacombs a or two, but determined six or seven interviews.'

b'It has become a symbol of Provence in southern France, but there is a warning that it is vulnerable to climate change.'

b'The Chaisse, expert of the Agricultural Research Institute CRIEPPAM in Provence, said: "The lawn in the Provence is effectively threatened because the plant has suffered in recent years from the effects of climate change, which has caused in the spring much less rainfall than in the summer'
b'I have an impact on the longevity of Lavendel.'
b'"There is also a small bacteria, a microorganism that transmits zika, and at very hot weather there are very few of them."'

b'The Chaisse said: "In order to have very long plants with a large number of flowers, we have smaller, underlying and either missing or damaged plants.'
b'"We have fewer parts with olive oil."'
b'The solutions in mind are a better water distribution and the reduction of evaporation from the ground, but also the treatment of the plants with a protective mixture of tongue and water and the development of cultivars that are more tolerant to dry conditions.'

b'The murder of a journalist underscores the growing threat in Mexico'
b'The staff of the weekly newspaper Riodoce typically meet with reporters to review their plans for reporting on the recent chaos in the state of Sinaloa by the organized crime,corruption and unlawful drug trafficking.'
b'The next day, in the shadow of their own tragedy, they came together to talk about safety.'
b'I was told that it is important to change their routines.'
b'The high-profile journalist discusses what feels more safe: They should take their children with them to the office, which was the target of an attack with Granite, or let them stay home.'
b'The experts have written three words on a table at the front of the room: Attackers, Neutrals, Survivors.'
b'I ask the reporters to suggest names for each column - no evidence is needed, guesswork and brainwaves suffice.'
b'The drug traffickers, politicians, businessmen, journalists, who are suspected to be on the payroll of the government or the carnival, are a catalog of criminals that make the chaos of Mexico dangerous.'
b'I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a pause from the violence, and while in the whole country the dead are getting heavier, more journalists are involved: at least 25, since President Enrique Pe\xc3\xb1a Nieto took office in 2012. 589 are standing up after attacks and threats under federal law.'
b'The last one is her creator and her inspiration from Rio de Janeiro, the founder Juan Antonio Cardenas.'
b'"The biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and be a journalist," wrote Valdez in one of his numerous books on violence involving drugs.'
b'Ignorance is deeply felt, though his presence is everywhere - a large photo of Valdez showing his middle finger with the word "Justice" hanging at the facade of the Rio de Janeiro General Hospital. Two reporters in the three-quarters of the 1970s and early 1980s'
b'The workshop takes place less than two months after his death, and the reporters discuss their shared issues, the trauma, their Alpt experiences, sleeplessness, paranoia.'
b'It was 2010 that a special prosecutorship was established to investigate the cases of journalists, which according to the Committee for the Protection of Journalists only filed two criminal charges.'
b'The vast majority of suicides each year are linked to drug trafficking and organized crime, but the murders of journalists are only rarely prosecuted.'
b'The Riodoce continue to insist on treating the violence of Sinaloa, though they are uncertain and although the Terrace is now more secret.'
b'The information about the murderers, without justice, has made the meeting to discuss security little use, says Ibarra.'
b'"It is very dull to waste my time in this workshop," he says.'
b'"So long as we don\'t know the Why, we miss everyone."'
b'The morning of the 15th, Valdez left the office of the newspaper Riodoce in the town of Culiacan.'
b'I only managed to drive a few blocks far before my red Toyota Corolla was attacked by two men. He was pulled out of his car and 12 times fired on it, probably because of the name of the newspaper - the one with "Zero Chance".'
b'The gunman drove in his car away and killed it in the process.'
b'Iz was 50 years old.'
b'I left behind a wife and two elderly children.'
b'The rumors neighbourhood of Culiacan is free to flee.'
b'The issue of Valdez is practically nothing but silence.'
b"In Guzman's arrest last year and the release in the United States in January, Sinaloa has become one of the most blunt battlefields of the country as rival factions fight here to fill the void."
b'It doesn\xe2\x80\x99t make sense that in Sinaloa every day someone or two people are killed on the street or that the graveyard is full of empty, two-story mausoleums for drug lords, which are bigger than many houses for the dead.'
b'I remember for a minute that there is a state of "Rule" when only a map has the control over the coastal state with its valuable ports and drug trafficking routes into the United States.'
b'This and despite the fact that Valdez was aware of the dangers of his work, is Ismail Bojorquez (60), a co-founder and director of Riodoce, with the regret that he could not protect his friend.'
b'I believe that two misconceptions have contributed to the murder.'
b'It was in February that there was an interview with Damaso Lopez, a leader of one of the rival clans in the war with Guzman\xe2\x80\x99s sons.'
b'The closure may have hurt the sons, presumably Gang members bought each copy of the magazine on the day it was delivered to newspaperskioske.'
b'The second mistake was not to allow Valdez to leave the country after the arrest of another newspaper that had published the same story, leaving the country to its own safety.'
b'Ifz was a legend in Mexico and elsewhere, and his death is regarded as a milestone in the Mexican violence against journalists.'
b'I had lived so long that his friends and colleagues assumed that he would always be there.'
b'I was 2003 an experienced reporter for Noroeste when I teamed up with five colleagues to start Riodoce and sell 50 percent of the company.'
b'"In Sinaloa, it was impossible to run journalism without touching on the drug problem," Bojoquez said.'
b'The newspaper earned a reputation for its muttering and honest reporting, and the revenue and advertising took over.'
b'I loved being able to publish hard-hitting investigations without fear of plagiarism, and the readers were fascinated by a publication where they could read stories that no one else could treat.'
b'The years after the founding of Rio de Janeiro, she received the prestigious "Maria Moormoor Cayo Award" for her reporting in Latin America.'
b"The same year, Valdez won the 'International Press Freedom Award' of the Committee for the Protection of Journalists for his courage in defending the Mexican drug history, wherever it led."
b'I gave up voluntarily that he had fear.'
b'"I want to continue," he said to the time of the CPJ award.'
b'The drug trade in Sinaloa "is a lifestyle," he said in October in an interview with Rompevia TV.'
b"It's up to you to take on the task that you feel is most important to you as a journalist - either that or you play the dumb."
b'"What did you do at the sight of so many dead... why didn\'t you say what was going on?"'
b'This Riodoce team misses Valdez, the funvogel who could flush like a prisoner, the friend who was generous with hugs and prayers, a teacher who knew how to survive.'
b'I trusted on his routine.'
b'I would always wear my hat.'
b'I would always go to El Guayabo, the bar opposite from the office, and sit there always at the same table.'
b'I ask them: Was his love for Rousseau his fate?'
b'The death also forced her to question her own assumptions about how she can best perform her job and stay alive.'
b"I don't like it when you're working with their women, their children, their clean shops, their local start-up and landfills, to move cocaine."
b'"These things weren\'t allowed to happen," Bojorquez said.'
b'The result is, even in the best of times, a high level of self-discipline and self-control.'
b'I trust my own instincts.'
b'In case it smells wrong, stay away from it.'
b'"It\'s frustrating," said the hermit of Rio de Janeiro Andres Villarreal, that "Gerardo has a sense of humor that can be fooled... and then the thing with Javier is happening."'
b"The old rules, as he and others say, don't apply in Sinaloa anymore - as well as in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states, in which a gifted mixture of lusterous slavery routes, poor institutions and corrosive regimes"
b'The landscape changes constantly.'
b'In the room where the staff of Riodoce attended security training were suddenly no cell phones allowed. Days ago, it was revealed that spyware, which is sold exclusively to governments, was used to spy on journalists and activists in Mexico.'
b'I sucked two cops protection from the heat of 104 degrees (40 degrees) in the shadow of a tree.'
b'I was asked to protect the offices of Riodoce in a four-story building in a middle-class suburb of Culiacan.'
b'I inhaled, asking some of the reporters if these officers were to the 50 percent of the police, which the governor himself described as not trustworthy.'
b'This is months since the reporters have been in the mountains where the drug gangs are de facto under control.'
b'The issue of this week has Riodoce on three main stories.'
b'It was the death of the brother of the former legendary boxer Julio Cesar Chavez in Sinaloa.'
b'I also had an excerpt to the State Budget that focused on the hometown of the Governor.'
b'It was a group who broke into one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan, a block from the office of the prosecutor.'
b'I didn\xe2\x80\x99t have an official word on who was kidnapped or how it happened, so precaution was taken when it was time to write what everyone in the city knows: that the restaurant is a favorite of drug dealers and authorities.'
b'The reporter learned from public surveillance that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politician who is affiliated with the Republican Institutional Revolution Party (PRI), which dominated almost the whole century all political levels.'
b'It has been reported that several PRI officials have been arrested for high-profile cases of fraud.'
b'Ireal asked the reporter to write about previous incidents in this pub, including one in which a son of "El Chapo" Guzman died a military overdose.'
b'The few months earlier, the readers would have regarded the column of Valdez as the most informed source about the kidnapping.'
b'"Finally, we\'d already known what happened," said Villarreal, 46, with the nickname "El Flaco" because of his thin body.'
b'"Now all the channels of communication with our sources have been destroyed."'
b'The office of Valdez has been converted to a storage area for signs and posters protesting the murder of journalists, because the staff have become something they themselves never expected: activists in the name of the press.'
b'In the meantime, Miriam Ramirez threw up a few signs and went to a demonstration for a second reporter to the office of the prosecutor.'
b'The Adame disappeared three days after Valdez was killed, in the northern state of Michoacan.'
b'The burnt body was found and authorities say based on DNA testimony that it is his.'
b'The whole country\'s journalists are becoming loudest, by writing in organized protests "SOS Press" on walkways and buildings.'
b'The filmmaker Bolh\xc3\xa3o is away from Washington and is trying to collect international support for the trial in the case of Valdez.'
b'In a meeting with the governor of Sinaloa on the day of the assassination, Ramirez accused the authorities of kidnapping journalists and putting them to death because they have said the truth.'
b'I have since been asked to be re-appointed by the government because I am concerned that her wrath has damaged my objectivity.'
b'Iz had repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico were exposed to organized crime, involved government officials and a same-sex society.'
b'In his last book, "Narco-Journalism," he wrote that reporters are not only killed by drug traffickers, but also on the orders of politicians and security forces who were involved with the organized crime under a cover.'
b'The media whistleblower group "Articulo 19" has identified more than half of the attacks on journalists of police and prosecutors to be illegal.'
b'"In Mexico, you die because they want you to keep the mouth shut," Ramirez said.'
b'I suspect the murders have an abhorrent effect.'
b'I remember the death of blogger Maria Elizabeth Macias in northern Mexico six years ago.'
b'"The body was found along with a note that was supposed to be signed by the Zetas-cartel: "His Majesty, I am sorry for my reports."'
b'The computer and headphones were next to her abdomen.'
b'The Filiales have chosen to close, as the newspaper El Norte in the northern province of Chihuahua after the murder of Corinne Breach in March.'
b'I continue to do as El Manana of Nuevo Laredo did after the assassination of her director in 2004.'
b'I responded to the Diario de Ciudad Juarez publicly with a Leitmotif on the front page with the phrase "What do you want from us?"'
b'The journalists are from their home countries or even from the country.'
b'The decision is a bitter one.'
b'It is hard to find work in exile, and they still watch the streets and look for danger.'
b'The sometimes they are murdered, as it appears to be the photographer Ruben Espinosa, who was murdered 2015 together with four women in a house in Mexico City three months after fleeing from Veracruz.'
b'The ones who stay and continue the work is a daily dance with risky decisions.'
b'Ibarra, who aspired to be a diver, gives to the drug trade.'
b'"Mexico goes to hell, and so I became reporter," he said.'
b'In mid-morning last Friday, when the last issue was already over, the Redskins of Rio de Janeiro sat down on the street near the office and drank cocktails as on one occasion all their phones began to suck.'
b'The series of shootings with bandits and security forces in the area of Mazatlan had left 19 confirmed dead.'
b'The war continued as promised by a series of maps in the region.'
b'The Border Patrol has posted the news on the website of Riodoce via phone.'
b'The title page had to be changed the next day.'
b'Ienen helicopters helicopters helicopters - another shooting in the area.'
b'Ijorquez warned the cops, who held waves, to see if they were in range.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cIf they had any fear, they didn\xe2\x80\x99t show it.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b"The ornate portrait of the fallen founder of the newspaper, whose middle finger was visible for quite Sinaloa, followed the staff of Riodoce's traces."
b'"How can you even think to close it," Bojorquez said, "when at the same time that Javier was murdered, the Praktiker asked me to send her to report on the murder."'
b'Iosaurus used Tartarus to fight his enemies'
b'In the first place it looks like a statue, if not an embarrassing one.'
b'The researchers have found that the first findings of the amazing skeleton of a Canadian alpinist were so well preserved that experts have described it as "Mona Lisa of the Dinosaurs".'
b'I was so well preserved that they even noticed that his shaved skin was of pale brown - and they said it had something of an "unsettled past."'
b'The report in the journal "Current Biology" described him as "the best fossilized dinosaur ever found, and one of the best fossilized dinosaurs of the world".'
b'The fossil is a newly discovered species of nodosaurian that lived in the middle of the Kreide age between 110 and 112 million years ago.'
b'In its incredibly well preserved condition, researchers who describe it as "real beast" are shocked'
b'The report in National Geographic is that the fossilized plant is the best preserved fossil of its kind.'
b'I was found by Shawn Funk on March 21st, 2011 in the Suncor Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in northern Alberta, Canada.'
b'I traf on something that seemed to be feathered feathers, and decided to look closer.'
b'The of his discovery was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology.'
b'I spent the next six years trying to locate the wildebeest creature within the 2.500 pound (1.100 lbs) of it.'
b'The result of all this hard work is now ready to be revealed.'
b'"If you look just a little closer with your eyes, you could almost believe it was sleeping," said the main author Caleb Brown, researcher at Royal Tyrrell Museum, where the creature is to be seen.'
b'"It will be included in the science fiction as one of the most beautiful and atmospheric dinosaur fossils - the Mona Lisa of the Dinosaurs."'
b'The researchers have found that this plant creature, although it is covered with a coat and looks like a walking panther, was likely attacked by flesh eaten dinosaurs.'
b'I strongly believe that the Dinosaur used a red and white tar to protect itself from rabies, and used an abbreviated technique known as counter-terrorism, which is also used by many modern animals.'
b'This would have allowed it to blend better into its surroundings and avoid its foes, say experts, which suggests it was attacked by larger dinosaurs.'
b'The 110-million-year-old creature from the family of Nodosaurians has made headlines in May and is now at Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology.'
b'The researchers have now studied the wildebeest creature and it has been called Borealopelta markmitchelli after the museum engineer Mark Mitchell, one of a team that spent more than 7,000 hours investigating it carefully.'
b'The preservation of the specimen enabled Dr. Mitchell and a multidisciplinary team of researchers to document the pattern and form of claws and rifles on its body.'
b'I discovered the colony defense, a common defense method in the animal kingdom, which means that the top of the creature was darker than its underside.'
b'This is where the constraint is common, as the results are surprising as the size of Borealopelta exceeds at least the size of the today living animals.'
b'It denotes that the dinosaurs were hunted by enough pressure by flesh eaten dinosaurs that the Evolution enabled the spread of conquest as a means of survival.'
b'The most zeitgeist animals that use the condom - think of reptiles, zebras or gorillas - are much smaller and more vulnerable than beasts, which signals that this nodosaurian is going to have a real battle to survive.'
b'"Starry-eyed raptors on a massive, strongly clawed dinosaurs show how dangerous the dinosaurs must have been of the Kreide Age," Brown said.'
b'The chemical analysis of organs in their scales also revealed that the skin of the dinosaur was red.'
b'I continue to investigate the animal on evidence of its life, including its preserved bones, to determine what it has eaten as its last meal.'
b'I believe the dinosaur, when he died, sank into a river and sank into the ocean, where he sank on the bottom to the sea floor.'
b'I remember this time Alberta was as warm as South Florida is today, and rivers and oceans were likely much further north than they are today.'
b'"The nodosaurier is truly distinctive because it is fully covered with preserved skin, but also remains in three dimensions and retains the original shape of the animal," Brown said.'
b'The result is that the animal nowadays looks almost identical to that of the early bronze age.'
b'"You don\'t need much imagination to recreate it. If you just look with your eyes, you could almost believe that he\'s sleeping."'
b'The Kreide Age was a time when gigantic dinosaurs, flew on two legs, ran through the Earth.'
b'The King of them, the Tyrannosaurus Rex, lived millions of years after Borealopelt lived, the fierce dinosaur was hunted by some of its furry predecessors.'
b'This is the Acrocanthosaurus, a 38 foot (11.5 m) tall, six-foot-tall monster.'
b'The scientists whose latest findings appear in the journal Current Biology believe that Borealopelta died after the death in the ocean and was mutilated.'
b'The creature was found by Shawn Funk on March 21st, 2011 in the Suncor Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in northern Alberta, Canada.'
b'In the museum, it is the best-preserved skeleton of the world, including skin and coat, and is completely covered from the skull to the shoulder.'
b'The creatures were in average about 18 feet (5 meters) long and carried up to 3,000 pounds (1.300 kg).'
b'It encompassed two 20-foot-long Spitzes that ran from its shoulders.'
b'The researchers believe that the grey plant was carried through the west coast of Canada until an overgrown lake flooded it into the open sea.'
b'The underwater body of the dinosaur was preserved in exquisite detail.'
b'The hidden remains of this particular specimen are so well preserved that the bones still retain holistic pants along the bones'
b"If Michael Greshko wrote for National Geographic, a such level of preservation is as'seltered' as a win in the Lotto."
b'The more I look at it, the more confusing it becomes.'
b'The boneless remains of the skin still cover the holistic pants that carry the skull of the animal.'
b'The right front flank is at his side, his five fingers are stretched down to the top.'
b"I can count the shovels at his socket'."
b'Ignition: Masses of smoke on A8: Many dead'
b'It happened on Thursday afternoon on the A8: More than 30 vehicles are involved in a mass collision.'
b"I've seen numerous victims, kilometers - and gasses."
b'This morning, on the Autobahn in Stuttgart, about 20 people have been killed in a collision.'
b'The first reports said at about 17.00 a.m. between the intersection of Adelsheim and Omaha (Land of Amish) were about 30 vehicles, including likely trucks, injuring themselves.'
b'The exact number of deaths were initially unknown.'
b'I handled minor to moderate injuries, said a police spokesman.'
b'The large number of ambulances were at the scene.'
b'The A8 was completely blocked.'
b'If you were driving north, you would form a roughly ten mile long back-country.'
b'If a AZ reporter reports, it also came to a halt on the roadway to massive delays - by numerous gators.'
b'The fire department notified the drivers of the vehicles, who now face emptied fines.'
b'The aftermath of the collision caused another accident on the A8, this time between Atlanta and Dasing.'
b'I was involved in a collision between a car and a truck.'
b'The ambulance was on its way to the scene.'
b'"British Railway": Konzern testet "Comfort Check-in"'
b'This is a moment that almost everyone has experienced: Not a minute ago you sat in the train and slept.'
b'The man is deeply invested in his work and has just come up with a brilliant thought.'
b'The next thing you know: puffy.'
b"I'm going to the chase and weigh a unknown or pull the driver mittens out of the workflow."

b'The days of undertakings are soon to be over.'

b'"It will then be available beginning next year on many other train lines in the UK," said a Railway spokesman.'
b'"Comfort check-in" the train calls for the ride-sharing process without cheating.'
b'If you want to use the app, however, you must meet some requirements: You need a smartphone or tablet.'
b'This requires you to book an online ticket - which without doubt already do most riders.'
b'It also requires you to purchase it via the app of the train, the DB Navigator, which is probably the most convenient way to buy tickets.'
b'The last thing you need is a seat reservation.'
b'The "comfort check-in" process works as follows: You step into the train, call your ticket under "My Tickets".'
b'The test customer will then see a button to electronically enter the data.'
b'The train passengers get on their mobile devices a notification that passenger X is in the train and has taken the reserved seat Y.'
b'The train driver at the ticket counter at Place Y knows that there is a passenger with already enrolled online ticket.'
b'I can also continue to sleep, continue to work, continue to cry.'
b'The "check-in" has two benefits: one for the customer, one for the train company - which again will benefit the passengers.'
b'If you want to travel relaxed without ticket control by our trainees, check in the DB Navigator just yourself.'
b'"It allows riders to personalize their journey in the train," says Michael Peterson, marketing director of DB Fernbush.'
b'"And our staff have more time than today to focus on the individual needs of our customers."'
b'If you often travel train, you know that along with delays and missed trains, the ticket controls are among the most annoying.'
b'I often have myself, in any case but one of the fellow travelers, not all the documents you need to retrieve online tickets.'
b'It may be missing the credit card or the Personal Identification Number or otherwise a document you need to show.'
b'The result is endless discussion between train driver and passenger, which leads to bad mood in the elevator or large room and delays in controlling the own ticket and giving the skipper at the end the time to take care of other concerns.'
b'It can only be used by a small number of test customers to use the new service.'
b'The same is also true on the lines 915 Dortmund-Stuttgart and 912 Stuttgart-Essen.'
b'The train numbers on the same line are yet to be released.'
b'"How did an activist come to learn the answer to the question: "Whose Streets?"'
b'The 9th of August 2014, Brittany Ferrell was burnt to her core.'
b'The next day, when she arrived in New York City, the in St. Louis-on-the-Lake girl sat on the bed of an Airbnb apartment she rented and scrolled through Facebook on her phone.'
b'I stumbled across a post from someone from the high school.'
b'"The police just killed an 18-year-old boy, and it is still lying on the street," said there.'
b'Ignoring that no one else had posted on their feed the information, she closed Facebook and opened Twitter.'
b'The user with the handle @TheePharoah was constantly retweeted on their timeline.'
b'The rapper from the area of St. Louis was watching the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed black 18-year-old who was shot by a white cop in Ferguson, Mo., live.'
b"I posted a picture of Brown's leaking body, which was placed on the street and would stay there four hours."
b'"That\'s wild," Ferrell thought at once.'
b'The death was for her and her community nothing new.'
b'I left my phone to later that evening to tweet about people on the Cannon Drive.'
b'"There were photos of the police band and people who shouted, and of a man claiming to be Brown\'s father who wore a helmet with the message: "Ferguson police just killed my uncle!"'
b'I observed a live feed where a police officer stood before a group of demonstrators with a bell-shaped dog.'
b'"In another video, she said, ensconced another officer\'s gun and shouted: "I\'ll kill you... animals all."'
b'"That\'s not common," recalled Ferrell of her statement.'
b'"That\'s not the kind of murder we\'ve become accustomed to and that we can call typographic."'
b'In this moment, I felt shaken.'
b'"He was whispering and weighed in."'
b'I booked a return flight and went home the next day.'
b'In the latter part of the night, she took her 6-year-old daughter out of the house of her father and agreed that the two would drive to Ferguson.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cWhat happened in the following three years with Ferrell and Ferguson,\xe2\x80\x9d is the subject of a new documentary, "While Streets?", set to premiere in the U.S. on Nov. 11.'
b'This is a story of survival and protest, of love and despair, of strength and resistance that exists from the perspective of people who live in the community and have filled the streets asking for answers.'
b'This morning Ferrell with her daughter, who wore a floral dress and a matching crown, drove to Ferguson, beating the two a conversation they had unfolded before this morning \xc2\xbbabout the black experience and the black condition.'
b'"You remember how I taught you when black people have to fight for that which they believe?" she remembered.'
b"I'm going now to Ferguson because the police killed an 18-year-old boy and that wasn't right."
b'"I could not take her with me," Ferrell said later.'
b'I think what happened today is a culmination of what... happened in the past.'
b'I have to know it and see it and draw it on.'
b'This must be well developed, not just activism and organization, but understanding the different layers of black experience and the black constitution and what we must do to be free to be ourselves.'
b'The more I have the privilege of giving her an experience where she personally doesn\xe2\x80\x99t experience any egregious discrimination, the more she is not different from the next black woman.'
b'"I have the feeling I would render her a bad service, keeping her away from me."'
b'The first stop they made in Ferguson was at South Florissant Road, a place near the police station that was converted to a camp as the activists waited for the potential non-disclosure of Officer Darren Wilson.'
b'I have known Ferrell and her daughter with a local businessman who made lunch.'
b'I berefted myself of pockets and helped to pass them to demonstrators.'
b'I began a new kind of activism for Ferrell Gestalt.'
b'"My activism has radically changed after the 9th," she said and recalled that she was a student at the University of Missouri-St. Louis president of the Minority Student Nursing Association and focused on food justice and reducing poverty in black communities.'
b'I had no experience in organising.'
b'"All is come to pass."'
b'I later met Ferrell during an evening demonstration with Sabaah Folayan, one of the co-creators of the film.'
b'Ilayan said she and her cameraman Lucas Alvarado-Farrar were just trying to "document" what happened.'
b'The question came Ferrell in mind: "Would you document or try to find a story you can use?"'
b'The skepticism was fueled by untold cases of people being abused, often by white people - in a community that profited from their pain and their resistance.'
b'"Folayan recently said in an interview: "We had heard that people who were born and raised in Ferguson didn\'t have their voices centered and we wanted to do it differently."'
b'Ilayan had previously worked with the former co-star Damon Davis, a artist from the area known for his activism rumours rumours rumours rumours rumours rumours rumours rumours rumours rumours rumours.'
b'The commitment brought Ferrell closer to the project, along with six other immigrants following the team of "Who\'s Streets?" in the years following Brown\'s arrest.'
b'"This documentary is not someone who speaks for us or talks with us. We talk," Davis said.'
b'"That was the main thing for me to see how these people are portrayed, because so I will be portrayed."'
b'"The goal was not to focus on Ferrell\'s experience - to show that there is attraction to the movement "not a Messiah flag, but a community that comes together," Folayan said - she emerged as the most open-minded participant.'
b'The follow-up to "Whose Streets?" reveals surprisingly personal aspects of Ferrell\'s life as she marries and marries her wife.'
b'"I felt like naked," Ferrell said and laughed as she saw the finished product for the first time.'
b'"After all, I have understood that there must be at this work and at the abuse of black people a certain cruelty."'
b'In addition, Ferrell\xe2\x80\x99s story revisits the role of black women in the broader Black Lives Matter movement.'
b'The three founders of the movement, who after the murder of the black teen Trayvon Martin in 2012 sparked the film "Black Lives Matter" in social media, identify as black.'
b'"Black, white women in leadership positions have shaped the movement overall," Ferrell said, "and so we constantly fight at different fronts.'
b'"White, black women must bear the burden of everything."'
b'Ilayan agreed, saying that "the movement is really being held by black women and many black women on a daily basis".'
b'It is assumed that "this is not an affirmative type of action," when Ferrell was chosen because of her identity as the heart of the film.'
b'"She was the person who burned this energy on her," she said.'
b'This is no surprise, though she was at the front because at one life at these crossroads as a black, white woman so much on the line.'
b'"You can feel their energy through the screen."'
b'The news cameras in Ferguson have long faded, but the rascal links between the community and the police continue to exist.'
b'Yourell is on bail for 21\xe2\x81\x842 years for blocking a road at a demonstration.'
b'It describes the societal atmosphere of the place she calls home: "A Chaos".'
b'I klank at a choir and she feels this choir belongs to her since she spent three years in Ferguson on the streets.'
b'It is our obligation to fight for our freedom.'
b'I am our obligation to win.'
b'I have to love and support each other.'
b'"We have nothing to lose - except our chains."'
b'"Trainspotting" to "Greatest Worst": TV viewers debate about Bit-Gallery'
b'The Bit Gallery moves the people, though it hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been built yet.'
b'The idea of a shopping mall at the south end of the pedestrian crossing has divided the community since its first presentation in 2009.'
b'This leaves the subject barely a mystery.'
b'It\'s on our Facebook page "Volunteer Bitburg" that the issue is discussed.'
b'"The one to the Bit Gallery: "That would be a dream" (Anja Becker) or "That would be really great" (Nicole Schausten), comes from the other side: "Brave no man" (Siggi Betzen) or quite simply: "Get up and'
b'In the hopes that a gallerie will attract more customers to the city, whereas the rest of the shops will benefit, the opposition fears that then the pedestrian zone will collapse.'
b'The Gallery will be located right on the property where the Farmers Market Hall is located, where 13 direct-to-consumer farmers will be able to sell their products.'
b'The start of construction will be concluded with that.'
b'The galleries are hoping to integrate a market hall into the new building - and of course to the Beda space with room to sit outside.'
b'The Zimmerman: "We\'ve been buying almost weekly in the farmers market hall.'
b'In addition to our eggnogs, but also the yummy cakes of the landlords always enjoy them very much.'
b'The meth has been discovered for us.'
b'I would hope that even during and before the construction of the galleries there is a chance to maintain this offer.'
b"I've seen other cities do that too."
b'"All the small market hall in Frankfurt is interesting."'
b'Id Densing: "Obviously, having direct sales in a market hall in the galleries comes down to the cost of rent.'
b'"Well, at that new project, it probably won\'t be just low."'
b'The Kilic: "Where are shopping malls in Bitch?'
b"It's clothes, shoes, drugstore or grocery stores: I don't think that's overrated."
b"I've seen plenty of them in our city."
b'I see how many stores here are empty - some for months and years.'
b"I don't think there is here yet a proper weekly market, so it's important that we at least retain the market hall."
b'I always find that the local produce is fresh, is mostly direct from the producer and is obscenely priced.'
b'This way you can see that stores in a shopping mall are only rented by larger companies, because the local rents are often not worth it for a single storey mall.'
b'"Oh, specialty shops almost no longer exist and what remains of them will then probably be disappeared."'
b'The Fandel: "A shopping mall with a market place doesn\'t fit for me.'
b"I don't think the galleries fit into Bitch's."
b'The most important thing: Where should the farmers market hall be during construction?'
b'The old Edeka would be the solution - even on a temporary basis, if the BitGallery ever actually comes along.'
b'"Does the creepy Bit-Gallery have any intention of shutting down all the shops out of Bit-Gallery?"'
b'The Marquis: "That will just not work.'
b"I don't need a shopping mall that is empty either."
b'I think it would have been better to promote a proper farmers market rather than this galleries.'
b"I forgot to mention that for a farmer's market hall, there is no place left thanks to the waht-like many - as far as I'm concerned - sinnless construction projects in Bitburg."
b'"When the farmer\'s market hall is burnt down again, a piece of culture will disappear."'
b'The perfect match: Artist creates portraits with Chelsea Manning DNA'
b'In the corner of the Fridman Gallery in New York City are many faces to be seen - white, black and brown, which seem almost identical - that hang at cables from the ceiling.'
b'The 30 portraits were created by the artist Heather Dewey-Haggerty from curls and haircuts that were sent to her by Chelsea Manning.'
b'Inning sniffed the extracts from Fort Leavenworth, where the former CIA analyst was sentenced to a 35-year prison sentence after she disclosed secret diplomatic messages via the website WikiLeaks.'
b'The new exhibition, which opened on August 2, is called A Becoming Resemblance (An appropriate resemblance).'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cThis is the product of two years of co-operation between Dewey Hawke, whose disability combined her expertise in technology, computer science and art, and Manning, a transgender and away-from-home disability, whose arrest by Barack Obama'
b'Iwey-Hagborg has created through the algorithmic analysis of DNA that was extracted from Manning and from the 30 portraits created as to how someone could look with these genomic data, a sharp, if slightly iffy comment not only to the form of the genomic data but'
b'Inning, who was born as Bradley Edwards, but has been open about her identity as a woman since 2013, was charged with 20 charges, including six violations of the spying law, computer fraud and theft.'
b"In the prison, her image was undermined so much that there was only one photo - a dark, black selfie, in which Manning looks uncomfortable on a driver's seat and wears a platinum pearl necklace."
b"The year 2015 Dewey-Hagborg came just from the great success of her 2012-project 'Strange Visions'."
b'The artist produced portraits of foreigners from forged artefacts like cigarette smoke and cocaine, using the DNA from the trash to create a picture of how these people might look.'
b'This was the moment she received an email from a newspaper.'
b'"She conducted an interview with Chelsea Manning while she was in jail, and they wanted a kind of portrait to support this article," Dewey-Hagborg explained at a press conference of the new exhibition.'
b'I didn\xe2\x80\x99t see Chelsea to this day and she couldn\xe2\x80\x99t be photographed, so I took contact with Chelsea and asked if she wanted to do a DNA profile.'
b'The artist and her infamous Muse became unofficial letter friends who exchanged in the course of two years several letters.'
b'The sculpture even included a by Shooley Kanungo illustrated comic "Suppressed Images", which predicted a future in which the president would change Chelsea\'s ruling and she would be in a position to see the exhibition personally.'
b'The fact that Obama actually only a few days after the book was published would demand Manning\xe2\x80\x99s release after seven brutal years in a military prison in Kansas City was a welcomed kind of happy reunion.'
b'In fact, there is also now at the opening of the exhibition something deep and starry-eyed as Donald Trump is leading a war against informants from the government camp and against transgender trolls to find new, tweetable ways to address the starry-eyed divide he is supposed'
b'"When Dewey-Hagborg was asked about the strange timing of all these things, she said that "Drugs happen out of a certain reason".'
b'The one on the wall of the galleries\' lobby called for Manning with her oversized signature below (the "i" in her family name is with a heart) a stopping of "automatic slavery, whose basis is gender, race, and religion."'
b'The side of the wall is their mitochondrial DNA sequence - a tautogram of Cs and Gs and As, written in Bleach.'
b'Iwey-Hagborg hoped through the incorporation of the 200 words (or Nukleotide after the highly evolved philosophy of the artist) to show how distinctive, at least in biological terms, we all are.'
b'"What people will hopefully take away from this is that our genome doesn\'t care about who we are and how open genetic data are for interpretation and how subjective they are," said Dewey-Hagborg, whose video clip from 2007, Spurious Memories, also included'
b'"DNA can tell so many different stories, so that\'s why the 30 of these stories are."'
b'The last piece in the exhibition, which is in a separate room, is a page from the above comic novel.'
b'It shows Manning how she can be reached with a free phone in hand from the displaced Americans of the United States like King Kong.'
b'"If they put your speech cold, then they have won," says it.'
b'"As long as you don\'t halt the mouth".'
b'"It came straight from a letter she sent me," said the artist, who grew up in Philadelphia.'
b'"I still get giggles when I talk about it."'
b"Inning hasn't been to the exhibition yet - as predicted in the comic book - but if she should, then she'll be greeted in the middle of the room by the masks, of their own genomic simulations, which look like they're going to be"
b'I was also targeted, as was everything in the exhibition, up to the size (5 " 2, Manning Stairs), at which their genetic haplogroups were written with Blemish marks.'
b'"In the past I had them at the wall, but I wanted them to look like a human being," Dewey-Hagborg said of the portraits.'
b'"I wanted it to feel like a mass movement forming with Chelsea, like the movement that was also behind their liberation."'
b'The University of North Carolina and a faculty member of the University of Oxford have been arrested for murder'
b'The nation\xe2\x80\x99s largest human trafficking case is in the works for a professor at North Carolina State University and an assistant professor at the University of Oxford, who are being investigated as suspects after a man was stabbed in a luxury apartment in Chicago with fatal injuries.'
b'This past Monday, for Wyndham Latham (49) and Andrew Warren (56) were sentenced to death for their supposed involvement in the death of Trenton H. James Cornell Davis, according to the records of Cook County Superior Court.'
b'The documents say that Cornell Davis, 26, died after several stabbings.'
b'If the police department of Chicago publishes a collective warning system, the leak was discovered on July 27.'
b'I received a call, came to the Grand Plaza Apartments and found the victim with multiple injuries to his body.'
b'Ill-Duranleau was still at the scene of the crime for dead, and detectives are investigating the stabbing as a suicide while the police are actively looking for the two suspects, said detectives.'
b'Ihem is a doctoral candidate in molecular biology and immunology at North Carolina State University.'
b'I. Cubbage, the Vice-Chancellor for University Relations, said in an email that Latham has now been placed in suspension and has been barred from attending the campus of North Carolina State University.'
b'"This is now a criminal matter that will be investigated by the appropriate authorities, and the North Carolina State University is involved in this investigation," Cubbage said.'
b'I am Senior Treasury Officer at the University of Oxford.'
b'The spokesman for the University and the Somerville College said in an email that "we are in contact with the police in Britain and ready to help the US authorities on any occasion."'
b"The statement added that Warren's colleagues were stunned and wanting him to step up."
b'The communications officer of the police department of Chicago, Anthony Guglielmi, said, he foresaw the suspects forcing them to put themselves in front of the authorities.'
b'"The police has a vision of their location, and our efforts to locate them are growing," Guglielmi said.'
b'Iglielmi said that local, regional and national authorities are helping to locate the suspects.'
b'Iglielmi said that the police received a call from the building manager of the Grand Palace, who had just received a clue that indicated that in apartment 1008 something had happened.'
b'The police described the scene as very sad.'
b'Iglielmi said it was unclear whether the incident also took place on July 27.'
b'I was told by security cameras that Latham and Warren were in the building.'
b'"We believe that Professor Latham and the victim had a relationship," Guglielmi said.'
b'The management team of Grand Plaza released a statement to the residents: "The police are currently working on the timeline and background of the victim and investigating a variety of motives, including a possible suicide."'
b'"We will conclude the WADA plan in near future" - the Russian Vice-President Mutko'
b'The Russian vice-president Vitaly Mutko said it will not be long before the remaining criteria of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) will be implemented for the restoration of Russia\xe2\x80\x99s anti-corruption system.'
b'In a certain stage of fulfilling the criteria of the Fahrenheit Plan, RUSADA has the right to plan in cooperation with UKAD (UK Anti-Doping Agency).'
b'"The WADA schedule has been updated in this regard," Mutko said on Thursday.'
b'The PM commented on the second part of the Fahrenheit Plan of the WADA to implement the Code of Conduct, which defines the criteria for re-establishment of RUSADA and has recently been published on the website of the organization.'
b'The Mutko contains nothing that could give Russia reason to worry.'
b'A lot has been promised, everything is being implemented.'
b'"The results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and the WADA in near future," he added.'
b'I agree with the in the list listed criteria, however, that the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (Russia Anti-Doping Agency, Russia Anti-Doping Agency, Russia Anti-Doping Agency, Russia Anti-Doping Agency, Russia Anti-Doping Agency, Russia Anti-Do'
b'The matter said Mutko: "We are conducting the investigation as our anti-doping system has made a mistake.'
b'The measures have been implemented.'
b'"There were no government programs, and we will not admit something that doesn\'t exist."'
b'Ikos words contrasted with those of Vitaly Smirnov, the head of the independent Russian anti-doping agency.'
b'The conversation with the Russian distributor RSport to start the day revealed Smirnov problems of past in Russian anti-doping organizations, adding then: "We have repeatedly said that the report contains umbrella positions and regulations.'
b'"I have no intention of accepting this report," Smirnov added.'
b'IRUSADA was suspended in November 2015 in the wake of the doping scandal by the WADA for the purpose of conducting doping tests in Russia.'
b'I was allowed to plan tests under the supervision of international experts and the UK Anti-Doping Agency (UKADA).'
b'In a visit to the headquarters of the organization in Moscow in July, WADA General Director Olivier Niggli said RUSADA is moving "in the right direction" to be used again.'

b'The Start-Ups that will help your company not become the next Uber'
b'The Errett wanted to measure your staff\xe2\x80\x99s happiness at your e-commerce start-up, but the surveys didn\xe2\x80\x99t work.'
b'I was often vague, little helpful or - even worse - fraudulent.'
b'The even though you promised anonymity, some workers did not trust the process.'
b'"There was just never conviction and objectivity," said Errett, who runs the 75-person San Francisco e-commerce hairdressing company Madison Reed.'
b'I have called people from outside for help.'
b'The new breed of human resources start-ups is at the forefront to help companies figure out how their employees feel.'
b'The creation and license of software that has the specific purpose of measuring employee engagement, it allows companies to conduct surveys, target specific groups and demographic groups, offer employees anonymity and complaints-hours, and provide feedback on their performance.'
b'"You now have tools like Strava and Fitbit for tracking your health, but where is the Fitbit for your company?" asked Jim Barnett, co-founder and chief executive of Redwood City start-up Glint, whose software-based tracking tools are based on'
b'Irett said she gained a better understanding of what your employees think and feel in the three years with Glint.'
b'In addition to the Snap Polls and surveys of certain teams, it also provides a heat map of the company that shows on a screen which units have the most complaints and which managers have low approval scores - so you can go afterbo.'
b'I come to a conclusion that you need to stay at the top of the workplace culture so you don\xe2\x80\x99t become the next Uber that has been caught in scandal since a former employee posted a blog post that describes an environment of intimidation, at which you\xe2\x80\x99re vulnerable.'
b'The start-up like Glint is making this need for an up-to-date list a lush business opportunity.'

b'Iverville, Colorado, start-up Converse, which helps companies prevent bad behavior and detect it, saw a surge in interest and activity beginning this year in the Uber fiasco in Mississauga.'
b'The company has almost 600 clients, including Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.'
b'I have been registered as a client.'
b'This glitch, allows Convercent to send companies customized "Polls" surveys, collect anonymous responses in real-time and view the heat maps of your problem areas.'
b'The company also offers an anonymous SMS call with which staff can report bad behavior.'
b'If the principal executive is involved, complaints are directed to the Board of Directors.'
b'"The court of public opinion has caught the Regulators," said Patrick Quinlan, the founder and CEO of Convergence.'
b'If a company is found to treat its employees poorly or be unethical, it may experience costly consequences through consumer boos, employee complaints and lawsuits, Quinlan said.'
b'The Tuesday, the restaurant chain with more than 5,000 employees and over 500 locations, has used Convergence for more than a year to ensure that staff are aware of the policy and procedures and have a simple way to reach their company\xe2\x80\x99s offices.'
b'It used to be that if an employee wanted to report a problem, he or she needed to find a phone number or email address for the company\xe2\x80\x99s customer service department, submit a form of complaint and hope that he or she was taken seriously.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cIt was often a humiliating and unpleasant experience,\xe2\x80\x9d said James Vitrano, Ruby Tuesday\xe2\x80\x99s General Counsel, who said there was no good way to track complaints from staff.'
b'I, as the company Convergence acted, can identify problems previously hidden by executives who sat in offices in cities or states - such as discrimination, discrimination or unfair practices- to be identified and addressed.'
b'"I can get closer to this wholesale, 360-degree experience with employment," Vitrano said, who leads the risk management group of Ruby Tuesday.'
b'"And we protect our shareholders from employment- law disputes."'
b'I began to consider ethics, values and employee engagement in 2002 after the bookmaker Arthur C. Andersen collapsed due to ethics violations by the Enron scandal, Quinlan said.'
b'It took until the "Society Media to their senses", that companies recognized that they could not prevent that their dirty laundry went online.'
b'"For the use of technology to monitor the Evidence, people used hope as a strategy," he said.'
b'This way, Glint and Converse offer your software as a service, and burden the companies with back-end fees for the use of their products.'
b'This is a business model and a chance to find the approval of Venture Capital Investors who have supported both startups.'
b'Ivercent received $10 million in funding in February from companies like Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, whereas the entire capital raised $47 million.'
b'Itzern secured $10 million in November from Bessemer Venture Partners and raised its entire funding on $60 million.'
b'The investment comes surprisingly, given the connected nature of companies, culture and Venture Capital.'
b'It\xe2\x80\x99s a growing complexity of research that shows that today\xe2\x80\x99s employees expect more from their jobs than ever before.'

b'The employees want to feel that you are respected and appreciated and that you are giving your time to a company with a positive mission.'

b'The Analytics Tools Third-Party promise to increase engagement and the use of the staff, it\xe2\x80\x99s no wonder you\xe2\x80\x99re finding support.'
b'The data on employee engagement after the experts of workplace culture are important.'
b'The data is nuisance when the controller of a company does not take any measures.'
b'If a company employee asks for your feedback, it may have an expectation that change is on the way.'
b'If the change doesn\xe2\x80\x99t come fast enough, or even not, this can breed enthusiasm and demotivate employees.'
b'"If you want to ask for 4,000 suggestions, you have to have 4,000 conversations," said Russell Raath, President of Consulting at the business consulting firm Kotter International, who has seen companies falling too far behind collecting data.'
b'Then if you don\'t follow staff will ask, "Have you really listened to me?'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cWhy do you care about that?\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'"While you don\'t care, why should I? "'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cReed, who now conducts monthly staff surveys, was able to take action at the same time when a problem is reported about Glint,\xe2\x80\x9d said Errett.'
b'The aftermath of receiving feedback from frustrated employees was prompted by the speed of decision making and quality of communication, in order to organize several teams within the company and add a communications training session to address the issues.'
b'This Ruby Tuesday gives the company new insights into the staff, and it hopes that on a long-term basis, this will lead to better recruitment of workers in a sector known for high turnover.'
b'"If you are not committed to creating a culture of transparency, you will lose the people," Vitrano said.'

b'"That\'s going to be for the boys the next three days a real treadmill," Bruins coach Jim Mora said shortly before the Monday became Tuesday.'
b'The NCAA eliminated two-day practices to alleviate the burden of the players, and it has actually extended their days - at least until the final on Friday.'
b'The first three practices of the UCLA team should start at 19:15 p.m. to match the already full time schedules of the players.'
b'The compromise away from the two days is more than a day that the Bruins missed the start of the camp almost a week after the last season and during the summer school for the first time during Mora\xe2\x80\x99s six games in Westwood practiced practical drills.'
b'I will be suspended in August for 18 practices. 20 before beginning the formative play-offs for their upcoming game against Texas A&M in September.'
b'I said that he supports the rule change of NCAA, even if it adds to the much-loved routes of the players a further point.'
b'"We place this enormous burden three or four days on them, and it is very challenging," Mora said.'
b"I've just been through it, they're placing themselves further, they're great people."
b'"As soon as we get to Saturday and we have more time, it will be really big."'
b'IUCLA will be suspending its practices as soon as the camp is concluded, which is an indication of clear viewpoints of its fields from an adjacent parking lot and the nearby Luskin Center, a hotel of high class, which has already been equipped with foot'
b'Iins-players are supposed to be in the hotel this weekend, but Mora said there could be a problem once these rooms are available during the season.'
b'"We will fight for our safety," said Mora.'
b"I think that's a real issue, and it's not far fetched to think that the people will rent a room and then put themselves there to record an exercise."
b"If you have the videoband of a workout, it's a pretty good deal."
b'I have security there, and we have security guards on parking lot 8.'
b'I will do the best I can with what we have.'
b"I don't make myself any more of a worry."
b'"We have a plan."'
b'The FBI will expand fact-checking in the fight against fake news'
b'I will send more potential articles with false claims to fact-checkers from third parties and publish their results under the original post then, said the world\xe2\x80\x99s largest online social network on Thursday. It is one of its efforts to catch so-called fake news.'
b'The company said in a statement on its website that it will begin using updated cognitive learning techniques to identify potential false statements and send them to fact-checkers who may be able to interpret results of the fact-check from the original article.'
b'It has been cited as one of the main contributors to so-called fake news, of which many believe that it has also influenced the 2016 presidential election.'
b'The issue is also becoming a major political issue in Europe, although the French elections in May were flooded with false stories, and Germany supports a plan after which social media networks are to be penalized if it violates the law.'
b'The company said Thursday in a separate statement on English that in the U.S., France, the Netherlands and Germany, a test of the new fact-checking system will be launched.'
b'"Near the realization of what stories are being investigated by fact-checkers third-party, the people want more context to make informed decisions about what they read and share," Sara Su, product manager for Facebook News, said in a statement.'
b'I added that Facebook will continue to test its feature to the "incoming article" and work on other changes to its news feed to prevent false messages.'
b'The creation of a comic novel: A castle in the history of England'
b'In his younger days, the little Scotch Castle was featured in a Squeeze music video and was for Margaret Thatcher in the 1970s and 1980s.'
b'The Scotch has witnessed 700 years of turbulent history from its humble seat in the Beamish River Talon in Kent and is now the inspiration for a fictional novel by Jamie Rhodes, a moggy Yorkshireman with a love affair with historical documents.'
b'"I think it\'s so nice to see the handwriting of someone who has been dead for 300 years," he says weighed in.'
b'"What a personal commitment to hold this letter in my hand."'
b"The 'A Castle in England' chronicles the period from the Middle Ages to Edwardian times and documented the families who lived in Scotland. Each story was illustrated by another, on-site British artist - Isaac Lenk, Briony May Smith, William Exley, and others."
b"This is not the first book of Rhodes based on an archival collection: He wrote 2014 'Dead Men's Teeth and Other Stories', a collection inspired by documents in the British Library - a project he uncovered emotionally."
b'"I only reacted to the damning letter on the side of a letter written so far by a double agent in the 1700s who worked for the Jakobiner," he says.'
b"I think that's his daddy's signature!"
b'The letter always smelled of smoke, because then you burnt a fire because of the light.'
b'The person who lives 300 years later has the scent acted as if he were himself also there.'
b'"Oh, I love archives!"'
b'The someone who is so meticulous with old paperwork that he is supported by the National Trust and Arts Council England and spent almost four months living in a castle ("To be honest, I missed my welcome letter a little over the top") seems this all too nice to be true.'
b'Theos spent his days exploring the Victorian "new" castle, visiting the archives and studying the many treasures and curiosities of the castle, such as the montified Hyacinth paintings on the walls and the bottles, bottles and glasses.'
b'I wandered through the grounds and ruins of the old castle and spoke with landscapers, gardeners and sometimes even with the artists who worked on the illustrations of his book.'
b'I, night, drank "Whiskey and started to write".'
b'The intricate history of Scotch is relatively unknown as the National Trust only received full access when the last widow, Elizabeth Hussey, died.'
b'It was Rhodes a few years later that the officers were just beginning to care about the archives, which he described as "half century ago, when Aristotle said "Oh, we\'re going to put it on the roof."'
b'"Books, letters from the time of the English Empire, maps showing who was who: "You might think land battles would be boring," Rhodes says, "but there was a bird to which the two families fought.'
b'"Look, let everything go its way!"'
b"The stories in the collection use the castle as an introduction to broader British history, including 'The Labourer', which follows a man who leaves the newly erected castle to join the farmer's battle of 1381."
b'"There is a record of a survivor who died 1380 in the castle, in this book entitled \'The Knights of Kent and Sussex\' ", Rhodes says.'
b"The farmer's strike began in this area and I thought a strike was a good start."
b'"How are the two connected?"'
b"The stories are firmly rooted in the history of the castle - like 'The Priest', which tells the story of the Jesuit priest who hid the family Darrell seven years during the English Reformation."
b"This is 'The Smuggler', in which the skeleton Arthur Darrell is portrayed from the 18th century, who performed his own funeral by filling a grave with stones (a discovery made only years later when his grave was filled with stones)."
b'The Darrells are Rhodes\'s family of Scots: "The gentlemen seemed to be pretty generous, always making mistakes and spending money for things they could not afford.'
b'"Generations of Darrell Morgan solved their debt problems by marrying remarkable old women - I imagine them to be a bunch of well-dressed guys with a talent to advertise marriages."'
b'The end of his stay in the castle is Rhodes on the hunt for other unique writing experiences'
b'It has a two-year stay in the Finnish wilderness for a comic book about El\xc3\xa4m\xc3\xa4nm\xc3\xa4ki behind it, the site of a sanatorium from the early 20th century that has since been reclaimed by the nature again.'
b'The Scotsman has a special place in his heart.'
b'"I was sad to go back," he says.'
b'"After all, now I have to be done with that stupid life."'
b'In progress: Over 300-year-old Marien-Cathedral in Rovaniemi burnt down'
b'The re-opening of the 301-year-old Mary Magdalene cemetery in Rovaniemi has sparked the city\xe2\x80\x99s campaign to introduce a new Dachsmark (Rovaniemi from Thursday).'
b'This week, Mayor Otto Neuhoff and his marketing team to Nelson Artz want to keep the logo and slogan secret.'
b'This August, as part of the campaign, there will be a festival on the island of Grafenwerth.'
b"It's too beautiful for us."
b'"Why?", ask the organisers of the campaign since yesterday on the posters at the Royal Chapel.'
b'"We don\'t think that (actually!) doesn\'t really exist," they write on their yesterday\'s free website.'
b'IAre you using this measure to gain your attention?'
b"I'm trying to make clear that some things are better than it seems."
b'"We are of the belief that we as Bad Honolulu residents know the beauty and charm of our city very well."'
b'The campaign is about more than "just" a logo and a slogan, it continues.'
b'"It is necessary to formulate a single promise, one that gives the city an unparalleled Allegiance".'
b'I steadfastly believe in the competitiveness of other municipalities.'
b'The medium-sized five-dollar bill lets the city of Bad Honnef pay for its new roof and the campaign.'
b"Immigration reforms in the Middle East - Erdogan's fear of the military"
b'This year beginning August, in Ankara, the Chief of Staff is meeting to discuss pensions and promotions in the armed forces.'
b'The same as this week.'
b'The first step is a normal one.'
b'The nothing is routine at the Turkish military a year after the coup.'
b'The meeting did not take place in the building of the General Assembly, as previously, but in the office of the Minister.'
b'The consultations took place under the chairmanship of the Prime Minister now also included the five vice-premiers as well as the Ministers of Defense, Interior, Justice and Public Safety.'
b'The civilians in the YAS were in attendance.'
b'The government is pulling in the military trains.'
b'The commander Hulusi Akar remains in office, but the commanders of the armed forces, the air force and the Marines were dismissed.'
b'The failed coup has dismissed 169 of the 326 commanders and advisors.'
b'The 10.000 troops were removed from the ranks of the armed forces - mostly because of supposed links to the movement of ex-President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who is seen as a draconian force behind the coup.'
b'The 485 people who were directly involved in the protests are in since this week\xe2\x80\x99s meeting in Ankara.'
b'The day after the coup, Erdogan had referred to the protest as a "gourmet gift" as he offered to give him the opportunity to "clean up the military".'
b'It has Erdogan\xe2\x80\x99s armed forces really in hand?'
b'In February, the newspaper "Huffington Post" published an article with the headline "Unrest in the military compound".'
b'In general, there are concerns about an increasing "Islamophobia" of the armed forces, which manifests itself in the removal of head-to-head restrictions for soldiers, the newspaper noted.'
b'It\xe2\x80\x99s big work at the military and the security sectors at the same time.'
b'In July, Erdogan fired per decree more than 7,500 police officers, including 2303 officers and 550 soldiers.'
b'I thought it looked like Erdogan had kidnapped the military.'
b'The Corporals galtled earlier than the actual gentlemen of the country.'
b'It put them under the spotlight for their role as whistleblowers of the welfare state.'
b'In his election 2002, Erdogan drained the power of the military step-by-step, notably under pressure from the reforms of the European Union.'
b'The retired officer says Erdogan is planning to target a radical Islamist attack on the armed forces.'
b'The magazine "Vocal Europe" warned a nameless non-combatant, who had been detained after the coup out of fear of infiltration in the country, the Syrian army will be "full of extremists and Salafists".'
b'If that were to happen, a such development could not scare the Nato.'
b'This is why in the Allianz after the slaughter, there is concern about the use of the Turkish military force.'
b'The leadership and operational capabilities are "critical," say Nato officials.'
b'I change the rules for the Green Card'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cThere will be a new US-immigration plan to change the rules of the Green Card,\xe2\x80\x9d said President Donald Trump, quoted by the media.'
b'Immigration reforms see legal immigrants cut to $50,000 per year, stricter regulations for obtaining visas for a temporary work permit and restrictions on family-friendly visas.'
b'The new rules are being drafted by the Republicans and supported by the president.'
b'The bill is to be debated in the two chambers of Congress.'
b'"This bill will reduce poverty, raise wages and save billions of dollars for the taxpayer and will do this by changing the way the Americans are given green cards."'
b'The law will prevent the chain migration and replace the current system.'
b'"This new recruiting process will help the candidates who speak English who have the financial means to support themselves and demonstrate knowledge that will benefit our economy," Trump said, quoted by the U.S. media.'
b'I want to fix the track for race cars'
b"I've talked in the past about the future of the rally shuttle - now it's going to be quite quick."
b'It will be completed before the end of the year at the maroon track, on which the tourist train rides.'
b'In order to secure the future of the Rennsteig shuttle long-term, according to the transportation ministry, construction is still being undertaken at the track.'
b'"With the decision to order the line Ilmenau Road to be ordered further and to be repaired, Egypt\'s government is committed to maintaining this important connection," Transport Minister Khalid Sheikh Mohammed said Friday in Erfurt.'
b'The cost of repairing the track was estimated at about \xc2\xa32.5 million.'
b'This sum will overcome the country 75 percent.'
b'The contract, on which the shuttle will be ordered also in the future from the country, is currently finalized, S\xc3\xbchl said.'
b'It said the Ministerial and the Southern Railway as operators were aware of the technical details already.'
b'"That\'s why the Fahrplan, the used vehicles and the quality standards have been negotiated," Snell said.'
b'The proposed contract between the Ministerial and the Railway Company will be for a period of eleven years.'
b'It is expected to be delivered to the racecourse by December 2017.'
b'The Rensselaer Railway Station is a popular tourist attraction between the train stations Ilmenau and Rensselaer.'
b'It has been tested in the course of a pilot operation to see if the train is being used by enough people to order it in future.'
b'The track is also in some parts stark pedestrian-friendly.'
b'The rising number of sex robots is real, and we should be worried'
b'If you thought it couldn\xe2\x80\x99t get any weirder in 2017, a new report comes out about the technological advances in the field of sex robots.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cYes, indeed,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.'
b'I-Robots are currently a big thing.'
b'The Foundation for Human Rights (SFHR) published a report on the development of sex robots in the next five to 10 years.'
b'The Noel Sharkey, emeritus professor of robotics and artificial intelligence at the University of Sheffield and co-founder of the FRR, says we need to take their uptake seriously.'
b'I can choose the eye color of the robot, its shape of the breast and the type of fingernails.'
b'"The people make jokes about them, but the companies deliver every bit of it, and we\'re going to see them much more often," Mr Sharkey said at the release of his new report.'
b'The sex puppets have been transformed from their on-the-go partners to robots with a Silicone head that feels warm - with intentional human responses achieved by the artificial intelligence.'
b'The user can also customize their robot according to their beliefs and choose anything from the eye color of the robot to the shape of the breasts to the type or colour of its fingernails.'
b'It will be even more concerning as many robots have the "permissive features" that would make a Stepford woman look progressive.'
b"I've seen sex robots evolve to robots with a Silicone face."
b'The RealBotix robot allows its users to customize their robots based on the features they find most appealing such as security.'
b'In addition, there are the from True Companion developed Roxxxy Gold Sex Robots with pre-programmed personalities like "Faith Farrah", which gives the impression of protectiveness and "Wild Wendy" with a "abnormal" personality.'
b'"Roxxxy Gold has a personality that matches your personality as much as possible," says the website of True Companion.'
b"I like what you like, and I don't like what you don't like, etc."
b"I've noticed that in the course of the day, they also have their moods - quite like real people!"
b'"She may be tired, on concussion fix or she may be "in mood"!"'
b"I have many bewildering aspects to this upsurge in sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the underlying feminine traits, the accusations of sexual abuse when you take a step on Frigidaire (heck, it's a joke) and"
b'The website compares True Companion Roxxxy with a vibration, but for men.'
b'"If women (sic) can have a vagina, why can\'t men have a vagina then?" says it on the website.'
b'The sex robots are not just a fetish or just a different sex toy.'
b'The Entity and its increasing refinement weigh on something dark and deep in our culture, on a retreat from the ideal of equal treatment of the sexes to a desire for sex with submission as an option.'
b'The vast majority of men will seek to hold no sex robots, and while the FRR acknowledges their growing popularity, they remain at the forefront of consumerism.'
b'I think what comes out of the margins can be very helpful in terms of the spirit of the time we live in.'
b"I don't think many people are not racist or discriminatory until they get the free market to give them the permission to do so."
b'In fact, there is a certain overlap that these high tech sex robots appear in a time when the rights of women are being threatened worldwide, in a time when there is a candidate running for president who has praised women to be sexually abused.'
b"The abhorrent aspect of the television series 'The Handmaid's Tale' ('The Report of the Maggie') is not the graft, the missing body parts and the excruciating eyes, but how realistic this vision looks."
b"The Republic of Gilead is a blast, but in hindsight, this doesn't feel like a big blast."
b'The goal behind these sex robots is to create a physical resemblance to actual women as realistic as possible (even with porn stars).'
b'I want to make them feel human, that they follow the movement of a real body.'
b'I, on the other hand, when it comes to their "permissiveness" the robots do not pose any real women.'
b"I can't be separated from my companion or just go away."
b'I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a vow or background, nothing that hinders unity or anything that could disturb the Phantasm total submission.'
b'In other words, they are gentle slaves.'
b'The way to put it in the context of 2017: servicemen'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s the big deal about that?\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'I make Mitt Romney into the incarnation of the healthy human being'
b'This has become a symbol of the Trump administration that the political divisions that have polarized the US have also divided families in small-scale.'
b'The week before Christmas and Thanksgiving, there were in the US newspapers with advice on how to deal with the horror of Trump\xe2\x80\x99s choice of candidates.'
b'This strengens us all apparently to make sure our filters don\xe2\x80\x99t plague us.'
b'I have noted the power of Trump to bring families together.'
b'I mention this because my co-worker, a lefty diver who lives in Chicago and has been working with the Republicans in our family, visited me this week in New York.'
b'It reminded me that uniting against a common foe can have a powerful effect.'
b'In Trump\xe2\x80\x99s White House, everyone she knows, including the Republicans with whom she had fought for decades because of the policy, is suddenly and entirely on the same side.'
b'The Esquire is certainly a good thing, but it comes in a further context that this also brings significant risks.'
b'The right-wing movement has been strengthened by Trump, but the enthusiastic effect of his presidency has given us the power to push us all toward the right.'
b'If we\'re talking about "normalization" and Trump, we\'re talking about the gruesome possibility that we\'ll be able to ignore his muses one day.'
b'I do however have a more disturbing long-term scenario in which Trump Republicans of the right are "normalized", which on top of their standards suddenly appear to be inconsistent.'
b"I find myself nowadays of a passive notion for Mitt Romney's urging version of the villain - the dog on the dashboard, the 14 percent income tax (but at least we knew how his tax return looked) - which were both in comparison to Obama's"
b'If Trump goes, the next candidate of the Republicans must be mentally fit to qualify as an unqualified improvement.'
b'I remember when my co-worker was in town, we brought our kids to the carnival in Central Park, the largest of the carnivals of New York City, and the best three dollars you can spend in the city if you don\xe2\x80\x99t need coffee.'
b'The horses are enormous, the Fiberglas designs on the central cylinder - all clowns are knuckleheaded and the animals turn around to look intently over their own shoulders - extremely finicky and the climbing music portrays this on merkable levels.'
b'The many clich\xc3\xa9s of a city ensue: The views of high buildings are old, the skyline is too familiar to offer much entertainment, and the reality of the city does not match the dream.'
b"It's twenty years later, and I'm still not quite overwhelmed by the fact that Swiss Cottage is in fact not a Swiss Cottage - the theme pub Ye Olde Swiss Cottage doesn't count - but a large circle in the north of London."
b'The Central Park Carnival is however still a surreal experience as here two two-year-olds, a 11-year-old and two women in the 40-something years can go on it and all have a great time.'
b'If I could have judged the Karussell, I would have given him the full score, but to no avail, no one asked for it.'
b'I was forced to spend this week in a grocery store to evaluate my "experience" with transactions on a scale from one to five stars before I could use my credit card.'
b'The coffee shop at the corner of my street is the same, plus the option to subtract the rating with a 15% drinking fee - this to buy something over the counter.'
b'This does not only lead to a distraction of what should be a neutral exchange, but also exert pressure on the server to include personality in a situation where there is no need.'
b'The poor woman in the store stood enthusiastic grinning, while I was tired of the experience of paying her my credit card with five stars.'
b'The Pistons have been transferred to the hospital with bruxism from the jail'
b'I Pis Pis Pis Pis Pis Pis Pis Pis Pis Pis Pis Pis Pis Pis Pis Pis Pis Pis Pis Pis Pis Pis Pis Pis Pis Pis Pis Pis Pis Pis Pis Pis Pis Pis Pis Pis Pis Pis Pis Pis Pis Pis Pis Pis Pis Pis Pis Pis Pis Pis Pis Pis Pis Pis Pis Pis Pis Pis Pis Pis Pis'
b'This past year, he was treated for cuts to his hand bones in the hospital, which he was told the prison authorities to have caused after a case in his cell.'
b'The 33-year-old was charged with murder after an appeal to the court for a first-degree murder trial.'
b"I killed Steenkamp in the early morning hours of Valentine's Day 2013, when he shot more than twice through a door of the toilet in his house in Pretoria on her."
b'The Pistorius claimed that he was mistaken for his girlfriend for a night-time intruder who was hidden in the cabin.'
b'The court has announced its intention to appeal this week against the six-year sentence of Pistorius, of which they say it is too after-effective.'
b'The National Crime Agency said it will file a motion at the Supreme Court of South Africa, and the motion may be heard in this year\xe2\x80\x99s trial.'
b'It runs the risk that his sentence will be increased to 15 years if the prosecutors are successful.'
b"I don't think there is a death penalty in South Africa."
b'The farmer Arnold finds a strange egg'
b'The last of the Blumberger schools were the fourth-grade students from Fulton and Epsom in the summer and transferred to the secondary schools.'
b'The enrolled students will now go to GCSE, four will go to the high school.'
b'The board of trustees welcomed on Tuesday evening the parents and representatives of the public at the Civic Center Bistro in Epsom.'
b'The symbol of the school\xe2\x80\x99s acceptance, the 29 students of the fourth grade under the guidance of Sophia Schumacher and Regine Meder chose a young Adler who will be raised in the shelter, then forced into the freedom.'
b'I led the munter crew to perform a musical called "The Adler in the Hill on".'
b'The Arnold found a strange egg, and let it be eaten by his hens.'
b'I saw a hunk came out a little adder.'
b'The hope of making out of him a shepherd broke out, the Adler broadened on a high hill his legs and encroached upon it.'
b'I showed the classes three and four in the assembly of Yvonne Frank performing a hammock.'
b'The heiress danced with the young goats, who wore cylinders to the game.'
b'The advisory committee steers clear of discrimination, said school principal Angelika Sitte.'
b'I thought the bird was different from the other birds (cocktails), geckos, etc.'
b'I will be but never be like a hunter.'
b'I believe His obligation is to be free.'
b'I wish every fourth grader to feel welcomed in his new school.'
b'I followed up with a thank you to the staff, the former school principal Michael Moore, who always intervenes when students are absent, and the parent volunteers.'
b'In the meantime, it is now over, explained classmate Sophia Schumacher.'
b'I enrolled my students after two years of teaching only very unfortunately, because it was a really great time.'
b'This time she has been able to rely on the fourth graders.'
b'In closing, all of the students sang a song of summer and holidays.'
b'The bravery of the children was greatly appreciated.'
b'The new school year has already attracted eight first-year students.'
b'The Bulgarian man arrested for illegal camping in Greece'
b'The Bulgarians were arrested for illegal camping in Greece, according to the Ministry of Interior, quoted by the BBC.'
b'The morning of August 1, in Sithonia was arrested by the police a group of illegal zygotees, including the two Bulgarians.'
b'The same day they were released, while currently undergoing an investigation.'

b'The Greek authorities have tightened control over the free campgrounds and placed anyone found to stay at a place that is not intended for this purpose substantial fines.'

b"I don't know exactly where the software update takes place?"
b"I'm trying to get diesel cars to participate in the campaign?"
b'The most important questions and answers in this guide.'
b'The Diesel Summit has offered BMW, Daimler, Opel and the Volkswagen Group software updates for more than 5,500 cars.'
b'It aims to improve the fuel efficiency of cars of the fuel class Euro 5 and partly Euro 6 engines.'
b'I-4-Diesel or worse are excluded.'
b'In addition, Smetanin from the ACE Auto Club Europe gives anecdotal evidence:'
b'The new campaign is mandatory?'
b'I agree that the agreed software updates are voluntary.'
b'"The mandatory updates previously applied only to the vehicles that have shoebox software," says Anja Smetanin.'
b'It has been recommended that the Kraftful Vehicles Act (KWV) be amended.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cWhen and how will customers be informed about updates?\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'The manufacturers have promised a speedy implementation in the coming months, but have not announced a specific date.'
b'I have asked for any affected person to contact me.'
b'I without a doubt will have an inspection pending, which will be done in their discretion.'
b'I wonder how long would the upgrades have to go overall?'
b'"Scary to say it," says Smetanin.'
b'I hesitate to mention the commitment of the manufacturers as well as the political pressure.'
b'"From what we have seen, voluntary actions of the automakers have not been taken on the issue of environmental concerns."'
b"I'm wondering how long does this update take?"
b'The repair itself could only take three to four hours.'
b'The longer it takes, the harder it becomes to get a date.'
b"I make cars that don't drive a car from BMW, Mercedes, Opel and the Volkswagen Group?"
b'The ACE advises you to wait.'
b'I would expect foreign manufacturers to follow suit, according to Smetanin.'
b'I now see a massive price drop from Euro-4 cars?'
b'The ACE believes that.'
b'This is just in the regions where speed limits are imposed.'
b'In the rural area, there was no value-added benefit for older diesel engines.'
b'The ACE advises, with a sale still to be made.'
b'I Cool J erh\xc3\xa4lt Kennedy Center-Preis'

b'If Haslach is formed for the Council as a Understanding Building Code Authority, the candidate must present appropriate certificates of completion.'

b'If they can\xe2\x80\x99t fill this out, the citizens would have to drive to Offshore.'
b'The citizenship of the city and its residents is important, says Wacker, who speaks of a good working environment as well as good communication between government and citizens.'
b'The more than 30 years in office have resulted in some significant projects, on which Wacker has prided himself with pride.'
b'"We make the city more livable," he is confident about the building department and its staff.'
b'This year, a number of aesthetic projects are on the agenda: The redevelopment of the former Hukla Avenue and the Lower Park area are being targeted.'
b'The Kincaid Bridge between Bolton and Steinway is being repaired, even though the stadium is still subject to renovation.'
b'I\'m guessing that last one will fetch about $1.5 million to $1.5 million, "if we\'re doing it right," Wacker says.'
b"Along the way, I'm expecting great things from my successor."
b'"Working here makes me feel better."'
b'I believe that for a city builder, there is great flexibility.'
b"If Haslam's own building and gardens can be adapted to Many, it could be fairly flexible."
b'"You can do much," says Wacker, and the design of the green spaces will be mentioned by residents and visitors often.'
b'The town as an ensemble undergoing restoration is important to have "a sense of what fits in," when new buildings are approved, says the borough\'s mayor.'
b'Along the way, the city builder bears high responsibility.'
b'"Builder," he says, "among other things, everything is going to run here over my table".'
b'The care and coordination can be found on long-time staff: Marc Neumann (Houston) has been there for ten years, Manfred Sch\xc3\xb6ner (Twenty) has been there for 15 years.'
b'"That his replacement is long gone," says Wacker: "We\'re looking for someone who is really committed to the position and wants to stay".'
b'Immigration was not only important for a good working environment, but also for the further design of the city.'
b'The Roland Wacker who wishes to be buried should be able to demonstrate to the City of Hasselt a bachelor\xe2\x80\x99s degree in Architecture or Bachelor\xe2\x80\x99s degree with a minor in Architecture and have good knowledge of the areas of construction and planning law.'

b"I've been thrown on pipes: South-facing tunnel is shut down"
b'The police had suspected the previously unknown thieves had thrown the blue bike from the train crossing in the area of Leoben Street (B118) onto the pipes.'
b'It was damaged so severely that the approaching cargo had to be escorted at all costs.'
b'The detectives are looking for two male suspects and have been searching for them since the night.'
b'The scene was watched by witnesses a red Roller Roller and a bicyclist.'
b'"That goes far beyond a lawn mower," said \xc3\x96BB spokesman Christoph Posch to the AP.'
b'The or the robbers had put themselves in great danger and also threatened the train service.'
b'The damage to the locomotive and the facility as well as the missed minutes and the cost of the locomotive repairs could also leave pockets of the Railway customers on the hook.'
b'I am of a "erroneous" mind," said the spokesman.'
b'The damage was repaired Friday afternoon, the train traffic on the southern line was able to operate without disruption.'
b'The ten person trains were cancelled Friday morning, two of which betrayed the ferry service.'
b'The trains did not fall out, they had however delayed.'
b'A \xc3\x96BB-Sprecher Christoph Posch had to replace about 200 meters of Oberleitung.'
b'The lawn and masonry were also damaged.'
b'Inflammatory foods such as meat, dairy products and chocolate could help reduce IBS (inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract)'
b'The meat and chocolate can be bitter for your digestive system like a Alptraum.'
b'The new study claims exactly the opposite: A diet rich in lean proteins and dairy products could alleviate the symptoms of patients with encephalitis.'
b'The uncomfortable condition, which affects around 1,3 million Americans and in Britain, causes migraine headaches and bowel problems, back or blurred vision, weight loss and extreme fatigue.'
b'If the sufferer is normally advised to cut out meat and dairy products to alleviate their symptoms, researchers at Washington University found that the essential amino acid tryptophan of proteins helps to develop immune cells.'
b'The lead researcher, Dr. Marco Colonna, explained that immune cells in the digestive tract are patrouilized to ensure that bacteria that lurk in food do not enter the body.'
b'The enzymes that are impairing the immune response are replaced by enzymes that promote the immune response and protect the body without damaging tissues.'
b'The balance is too far in favor of enlargement neck can result in an enlargement of the colon.'
b'In experiments, it was found that a type of tolerant immunity has been observed in mice carrying a specific bacteria in their intravenous tubes.'
b'The bacteria requires tryptophan - one of the building blocks of proteins - to produce the appearance of the cells.'
b'I Colonna said: "We have a connection between a bacterial type - Lactobacillus reuteri - which is a normal part of the digestive tract, and the development of a population of bacteria that promote the immunity.'
b'"The more tryptophan the mice had in their diet, the more they had of these immune cells".'
b'The researchers concluded that the combination of L-resinic acid and an anxiolytic rehydration tolerant diet promotes less endocrine disruption when the same system is also applied to humans.'
b'The post-doctoral researcher Luisa Cervantes-Barragan examined a type of immunity that promotes tolerantness when she found that a group of studym\xc3\xa4us had such immunity, but a different group of the same genome, which was separated under the same genome.'
b'I suspected that the difference had something to do with the digestive tract of the mice - the community of bacteria, viruses and bacteria that normally live in the digestive tract.'
b'The intestines of the mice were DNA-sequenced and there were six bacteria types found in the mice with the immune system, but without them at the time.'
b'The mice were placed in a sterile environment so that they didn\xe2\x80\x99t have a colonoscopy and they didn\xe2\x80\x99t develop this kind of immunity, and they received the L. replication and the immunity was created.'
b'In order to understand how the bacteria were affecting the immune system, the researchers placed L. reuteri in a flask and then transferred small amounts of the flask - without the bacteria - to uninfected immune cells.'
b'The immune system developed to the tolerant cells.'
b'If the active component was removed from the flask, it appeared to be a component of the Tryptophan Metabolism, which is known as insulin-like molecules.'
b'The researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in the feed of the mice, increasing the number of such cells by about 50 percent, but when the tryptophan levels were halved, the number of these cells sank by half.'
b'I. Cervantes-Barragan explained that humans have the same tolerant immune system as mice, and that most of us have L. reactive proteins in our immune system.'
b'It is not known whether tryptophan-like compounds from L. reactive proteins develop the immune system in humans as well as in mice, but mutations in genomes in relation to tryptophan have been found in people with encephalopathy.'
b'I said: "The development of these cells is likely something that we want to promote as these cells regulate infections on the inner surface of the digestive tract.'
b'"Perhaps high triglycerides levels in the presence of L. reuteri may lead to an increase in this population."'
b'I believe that Manchester United has signed with Nemanja Matic a "guy"'
b'The Manchester United has signed with Nemanja Matic a "great deal," according to Jose Mourinho, after the midfielder had made his debut against Sampdoria.'
b'The 40 million pound subscription of Chelsea started off with a 2:1 victory in Dublin, the last pre-season game before the UEFA Super Cup against Real Madrid begins on Tuesday, and proved invaluable in the Halsey role as people like Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereira scored'
b'Itic was however excluded from the pre-Autumn tour of the Blues and only managed 45 minutes, which meant that he had to improve before starting the Premier League season.'
b'"He needs time, but his experience, intellect, a genius in the way he thinks - he thinks football," Mourinho said.'
b'"We will help him, sooner than later."'
b'The Mavs also started Victor Lindelof and Romelu Lukaku in the Aviva Stadium as Mourinho formed his starting XI for the start of the season.'
b'The Independent endorsed in this week that Mourinho would like to have three more transfers, but he insisted that the club had already done a "fantastic job" of fulfilling three of its four pre-season transfers.'
b'"Did you get four of four, for that I thank the club," he added.'
b'"I will be happy if they get forgiveness for me four of four, but they have been great."'
b'I "painted" Dreamliner in the sky'
b'The US aerospace company Boeing has painted the silhouette of a Dreamliner in the sky.'
b'The pilots floated from Seattle in the US state of Washington, the zeppelin started but floated into Marquette in US state of Michigan and landed in the shape of a Dreamliner over the United States, which is several hundred miles away.'
b'The campaign lasted 18 hours and one minute.'
b'It was the shape of a Dreamliner.'
b'The whole thing was an endurance test for new engines.'
b'I had already seen such advertisements before.'
b'The number "787" and the Boeing logo were painted in the sky.'
b"I'm sorry for the deep dish for Martin Luther King Jr. - Atlanta, we have a problem"

b'The Martin Luther King, Jr. party has changed radically.'
b'This week, the staff from the Willy-Brandt-House have watched with growing enthusiasm the happenings in the Republican-controlled local governments.'
b"In fact Schulz has been coming from there since the beginning of the year, wouldn't be described with counterwind not even in context."
b'I was experiencing tremendous storms.'
b'I suppose one after the other.'
b'The Conservatives see the unexpected end of the redistricting coalition in North Carolina a general signal against coalitions of Democrats and Republicans.'
b'"This shows once again: Republicans can\'t justify regaining power," Democratic General Counsel Peter Tauber told the editorial board of the New York Times.'
b'The unexpected resignation of a Republican governor has thrown the government of minister Stephan Weil (UKIP) into a bitter mess.'
b'This month, his conservative coalition lost its one-third majority to the opposition from Democrats and Republicans.'
b'The Republican Congressman Michael Kellner has urged the aboriginal niece of the Republican candidate, Eleanor Twesten, to return her office.'
b'The move to the Conservative Party means a clear misrepresentation of the voters.'
b'"Twesten has to immediately give up her seat," said the vice chairman and candidate of the Green Party to the editor-in-chief of the New York Times.'
b'"That shouldn\'t even be true," sighs a Republican candidate as the new Hispanics message reaches the party\'s parliament.'
b'The Weil, Republican governor of North Carolina, stands up after the removal of Republican candidate Elke Twist to the Conservative Party without own government.'
b'This is the precursor to a whole series of big and small crises in Democratic lands.'
b'I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what comes next.'
b'The misfortune began with the unprecedented dramatic victory at the Saarland election in March.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cBlue eyed, more not,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Genovese of that time.'
b'The landmark elections in Scotland and Wales will be all the same.'
b'If it was then - and indeed it was - everything was much worse.'
b'The victory in Kiel put the SPD in its place, the D\xc3\xbcsseldorf victory made the party glatt.'
b'The Genovese rallied again in the weeks following.'
b'I, when they just had new courage, came the G-20 summit from Hamburg.'
b'I met with him the next deep blow.'
b'The Oval Office, the last strong Republican governor, lost its Nimbus because he sat in the Elysium while his city burnt down.'
b'I because he was in crisis communication after so much of what you can do wrong.'
b"It is Scholz's political destiny."
b'I also have Stephan Weil.'
b'In the VW scandal and his role in the board, the niece has been in the spotlight for some time.'
b'In addition to the survey results, other statistics came along.'
b'I, or perhaps just because, tried Weil in the past week to push stronger in the Bund.'
b'The best wishes of the former mayor of Hannover to expand his power in Berlin remained secret, even Genovese in the vicinity of Martin Luther King Jr. remained secret.'
b'I let him, as they were promised by Weil a stability of the party.'
b'This could be the exact opposite.'
b"This strikes Weil at the partisan zing of the niece's conservative party in the first place."
b"I don't think Schulz already."
b'This is why the Genovese are trying to keep the own ranks closed.'
b'The outrage is directed at the Republicans, and here it is most likely to be the abhorrent Senator Twesten.'
b'"It is unacceptable and democratic to assume that Mrs. Twenty-something puts her own career interests over the interests of all others," says Matthew Miersch, head of the party\'s editorial board in the House of Lords, the editorial board of the'
b'It is not because of her person as a candidate, but through the state list of Michigan Republicans in the House of Representatives, according to the Michigan Republican.'
b'I suppose the logical consequence would be that she returns her mandate.'
b'The Oppenheimer, chairman of the House of Lords, blames a "undemocratic maneuver".'
b'"The vote of four years ago was clear: The people have made Stephan Weil to Minister of Interior," says Oppermann, who leads the niece\'s party as the top candidate in the House of Lords, the RNC.'
b'"Nun misleading the personal career of a candidate is to mislead the candidate\'s vote," Oppermann said.'
b'I asked for the behind-the-scenes to be investigated.'
b'I want to know if there was more or there were further calls from the Democratic Party of Michigan.'
b'I. Funding for Orthodox Church III'
b'If you want to replace your inherited house, you can get the help you need from the government.'
b'I informed Mayor Albert Schindler and three representatives of STEG City Development on Tuesday in Earl\xe2\x80\x99s Court.'
b'The beginning of the information session gave Schindler a glimpse of what has been going on.'
b'In 1991 there were in Epping Sanctuary Sanctuary Areas.'
b'This year, in Sanctuary I from 1991 to 2004, the state has still taken up two thirds of the fund.'
b'I Sanctuary II from 2005 to 2016, the exemption was still at 60%.'
b'In Schindler\'s words, the recent renovations are a "success project" - it was finally important to encourage the interior development, and not just create new construction areas.'
b'The 4th April, you received from the Government of Kentucky the information that there will be a Sanctuary III.'
b'The grant amounts to 833 333 euros, of which 500 333 will come from the state, the rest from the county of Epping.'
b'The result is now a Sanctuary?'
b'I will, so Smith continues, investigate where the "real old" houses are.'
b'It also plays a part in whether in the proposed area there is any interest in replacing it.'
b'It may be that the territory borders could be crossed again.'
b'The STEEL performed on Tuesday night Martin Keller, Gabby Pietschman and Sarah Gotzel.'
b'I presented the contents of the federal program "Solar City", in which the repairs would then be performed.'
b'The goals of the program are the revival of inner cities, the improvement of living standards and creation and upgradation of infrastructure.'
b'The measures would be subjective, that is, per property.'
b'The Sanctuary would then finally be established as a charter.'
b'The application period for the funds has been extended from January 2017 still until April 2026.'
b'I would have to wait until September this year to do the assessment, in order that the at-risk residents would be given a questionnaire to fill out.'
b'The November or December will be sufficient to make the bylaw, so that in the coming year, the repairs can begin.'
b'Izschman then explained that each municipality had to perform the required pre-surgery tests.'
b'I\xe2\x80\x99m going to review the city\xe2\x80\x99s neglected infrastructure and decide when it will be repaired and in what order.'
b'It will be recorded for that particular property then a Sanitation Certificate in the grounds register.'
b'Itzschman will be able to come back to Earl\xe2\x80\x99s house and take a look at the situation, she promised.'
b'Izel said, a key success factor for the project was the involvement of the stakeholders.'
b'I will be sending out questionnaire which will be sent out in the next few weeks to the citizens and can be filled out by the end of the summer.'
b'The green questionnaire is the "building and property survey," where it is primarily concerned with the structural condition and the repairs proposed.'
b'The gray questionnaire, the "Household Survey", can be used to make statements about size, layout and residents of a residence.'
b'The blue "Business Form" is only filled out when in the building are business spaces.'
b'This is to be remembered, as Gotzel pointed out, that a completed questionnaire is not simultaneously a request for funding.'

b'The British inventor is the first in the country to be equipped with a microchip so he can open his house, enter his office and even start his car.'
b'The Northam, 33, had implanted the winged chip between dagger and index finger and now offers the service to companies and individuals who want to simplify their lives with technology through his company BioTeq.'
b'I have teamed up with Dr. Geoffrey Watson, a consultant Anatomist in the Royal Hampshire Hospital in Winchester, Hanover, to ensure that the implant procedure is performed according to medical standards.'
b'The technology is similar to a cat and dog implanted microchip and takes only 30 seconds.'
b'The company of Mr Northam also wants to change the locks to houses and cars so they are compatible with the chip, all for a fee of \xc2\xa3300 per lock.'
b'The retired father of one has now added both to his BMW Z4 technology, which starts when his hand is on the wheel.'
b'The advertising costs of the White House cost the taxpayer hundreds'
b'The decision of the White House to fly a Marine vessel to South Carolina for a demonstration marking the moon landing last month will cost taxpayers according to figures of the military, which have been given to TIME magazine, up to $60 million.'
b'The green-colored Sikorsky VH-3D, known as Marine One when the president is at sea, was the heart of the event on July 17th in the White House with U.S. construction programs.'
b'The Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and leading officials of the White House made a tour of products from all 50 states.'
b'In Connecticut, the Hubble Hubble was installed alongside a yacht from Maine, a fire truck from Wisconsin and a gathering truck from Mississippi.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cThe military office of the White House demanded the presence of the Hubble in a fragmented order or FRAGO, barely 36 hours before the Hubble landed on the South Lawn, according to the recordings of Marine Helicopter Squadron One (Squadron One),\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'"I just wanted to make sure you were aware of it because it is a sophisticated event with high visibility," the commander of the HMS-1 wrote at the conclusion of the event, referring to his predecessor, the commander of the Marine Corps for air'
b'The news showed that the Hubber arrived at 7 p.m. on the South Lawn for the incident at 15 p.m., and so stayed until the grass was cleared between 18:00 and 21:00 p.m. on that night.'
b'The note notes that, if the departure from the White House should be delayed due to the restriction of service hours, a second team would be needed for the return flight.'
b'The original pilot was stationed during the event at the Hub, while the security personnel of the unit spent most of the time on the ground at the aircraft.'
b"The TIME's recordings did not clearly indicate whether eventually a second pilot was needed."
b'The Hatch Act prohibits federal officials from using government property for political purposes.'
b'The quotes show that HMX-1 asked whether the incident could violate the requirement.'
b'"One of the questions we asked was whether it was a violation of the Hatch Act and we were informed that this was not the case," the commander wrote.'
b'"Kling as if you were confined," replied the lieutenant-colonel.'
b'The event "Made in America" was referred to by the White House as an official event and wouldn\'t be covered by the Hatch Act.'
b'I also believe that official events have political undertones.'
b'The event gave the president an impulse for reforming health care reform, which was in the Senate, and he promoted the efforts to amend the government\xe2\x80\x99s regulations.'
b'The use of the aircraft, known as Marine One or Air Force One, from politically favored purposes is not a new phenomenon.'
b'I am obliged to use them for the trip.'
b'The use of their use only for a photo-op is unusual.'
b'This led to an investigation in February, when the president piloted the drone before the start of his first campaign rally in Melbourne, Florida, taxi services, and his Twitter account is full of tweets about the use of the drone by his predecessors.'
b'"The White House is delighted with the show "Made In America" - which shows products from all 50 states made by American workers using American materials," said the vice-president of the White House, Lindsay Walters.'
b'IMX-1 battalions frequently conduct training exercises in the area around Washington and in South Lawn, to help the U.S. president in the White House with precision targets.'
b'In July, when Trump was on the G20 summit in Germany, HMS-1 conducted 58 exercises.'
b'The flight for the "Made in America" -event counted in the training needs of the pilots for the month, said a spokesman.'
b'The aircraft flew additionally 11 hours at this time for "National Air Force Unknown Missions".'
b'The White House said the taxpayer has not taken the burden for any of the other remarks made on the event.'
b'The spokesman for Sikorsky said the company was not involved in putting the Hubble on the South Lawn.'
b'IMX-1 does not undertake budgeting for the presidential flights, and it is difficult to estimate the exact cost of the event.'
b'The hours charged by the U.S. Department of Transportation for the fiscal year ended June 2017 is the DOD exemption for the VH-3D however $24,500 per flight.'
b'The records of the unit record the flight time of the plane as 30 minutes from the home base of the Marine Corps Air Force base in Quantico, Virginia.'
b'The White House argued that the actual cost of operation of the Hub is far below this rate.'
b'"The cost for the taxpayer on the basis of estimates for the reimbursement amount is highly improbable," Walters said.'
b'"These figures include personnel, maintenance and many other hidden costs included in the annual budget."'
b'This is based on a RAND study from 2015 which included the compensation rates for DoD not include the personal expenses, but include the cost of fuel, maintenance and contractual agreements.'
b'In this way, the former press secretary of the White House, Sean Spicer, defended the use of drones for the event.'
b'"The idea is to present this week things made in America," Spicer said.'
b'I know Sikorsky and the state of Connecticut are very proud of their contribution to our national security, and I am concerned that hundreds, if not thousands, of people are dependent on them.'
b'I think like most Americans we are all proud of the Hubble and other military equipment for which so many Americans have worked unparalleledly.'
b'"It is natural to highlight that."'
b'I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t sure if Trump intercepted the drone when he took his turn over South Lawn for the incident, but he placed himself in the driver\xe2\x80\x99s seat of a fire truck.'
b'The White House spoke to representatives of Sikorsky and chatted with the media about his own fleet of corporate products.'
b'"I know Sikorsky very well," said the president, "I have three of them."'

b'This after five matches still make up for the loss, the top scorer of the Second Tennis League has gained the sense of reality.'
b'The manager, Marius Zay, has certainly respect for the opposition.'
b'I think this is a compact team that always plays in fairly similar form.'
b'"On the behind-the-scenes, I think the team is very good."'
b'It\xe2\x80\x99s class and stability at the top of the hills at the Sheriff\xe2\x80\x99s squadron are primarily the imports from the highlands.'

b'"That will be as hard for us.'
b'"You also need a good dose of luck."'
b'The neck of the game for the trip to the highlands is practically sealed.'
b'The debut for Blue-Whale might be Maxime Janvier.'
b'The currently playing in the Challenger League in Italy\xe2\x80\x99s Biella active Frenchman doesn\xe2\x80\x99t make it to the Bundesliga play-offs, coming to the game in the Czech Republic playing Zdenek Kolar (Twenty-five) to make his first start in this season.'
b'The previously unbeaten Chilean Hans Podlipnik-Castillo was playing yesterday with the White Russian Andrei Vasilevski still at the ATP Finals in Kitzbuhel.'
b'I should have been in Kiel but as well as Botic Van de Zandschulp, Niels Lootsma (below) and the Belgian Julien Cagnina.'
b'Ignoring his two losses last Sunday against the club at the Alves could also make M\xc3\xa1t\xc3\xa9 Valkusz return to the team.'
b'The 18-year-old Hungary, who was in January 2016 still the number one of the Junior World Rankings, doesn\xe2\x80\x99t fill someone out of the coaching staff around Marius Zay filling the roster.'

b'In fact, Donald Trump didn\xe2\x80\x99t seem happy when he put Tuesday\xe2\x80\x99s signature under the law to curtail sanctions against Russia.'
b'"In his haste to pass the law, the Congress has inserted a few "legal provisions" into it," he said.'
b'The response from Moscow was as shocking as expected, and even Brussels blamed the US for the incident.'
b'The bill also proposes to punish European companies that help the Russians build gas pipelines in the EU.'

b'I have fixed contacts for the children and a commitment to the team.'
b'The borough\xe2\x80\x99s children\xe2\x80\x99s libraries will be re-opened.'
b'This September, the City of Krefeld will take over the food service in the borough\xe2\x80\x99s elementary schools again in its own hands.'
b'Ison Pommeranz, Associate Director of the Department of Youth Services, says this is a good thing: "We all enjoyed it."'
b'The cooking continues outside the house: A caterer takes care of this task and delivers fresh food cooked at home.'
b'The city has 46 kindergartens, in 44 the children get a warm meal.'
b'The past year, each child sat at the table, and the need has risen steadily.'
b'"Mitchell doesn\'t eat not only children who have 45 weeks of care in the school to midnight," Pommeranz explains.'
b'"This offer is also available in the 35-hour program when children stay until 14 p.m."'
b'The part-time staff will have kitchen service: They heat up the delivered food, add salad, raw vegetables and fruit, portion the meal individually, give the food away, clean up, and clean the kitchen.'
b'"The workers will be placed firmly in a care facility," Pommeranz says.'
b'The size - there are two-group as well as seven-group facilities - determines the hours of service.'
b'"The kitchen assistants are now integral to the Kita team," Pommeranz says satisfied.'
b'"So they are much more involved and it is easier for the school to implement pedagogical concepts".'
b'The same goes for healthy eating and cooking lessons.'
b'"The children should help prepare the food".'
b'The direct connectivity of the kitchen staff to the team is where it is needed.'
b"I'm sorry for the children."
b'"You have a known force in the school, a person who is familiar with them, and not constantly changing people".'
b'I believe that consistency is important for the children.'
b'The disposal of the child care facilities - previously also assigned to the kitchen staff - will be carried out by specially trained cleaners.'
b'The option - the separation of cleaning and kitchen service - has added to the quality of the kitchen service also the charm that it has made in cost-effectiveness between homeownership and foreign ownership for the city as the most economical, according to the press release.'

b'"The role of women cannot be overlooked," he said Tuesday in a statement.'
b'I can only be truly reassuring and credible when women are unaffected and participate in all parts of the election process.'
b'The provincial elections for the province and the presidency are scheduled to be held on April 5th.'

b'The 14-year-old girl trys to rob'
b'The young men in their 20s and 23s were arrested on Thursday trying to rob a 14-year-old girl.'
b'If information is correct, the men spoke to the 15-year-old girl, who was visiting friends at the Collegiate School, around 14.55 p.m. because they wanted to chat with the phone of the girl.'
b'The 13-year-old refused the request but continued to hang out with her friends.'
b'It was then that one of the robbers tried to grab the phone and the halo of the girl, which failed.'
b'The beast flew the Duo.'
b'The two young men were later arrested by the police.'
b'The investigation is ongoing.'
b"IMB's concerns about investments in the McVitie factory in Glasgow"
b'The union wants to speak to managers of the Biscuit manufacturer McVitie about the long-term commitment to production in their factory in Glasgow.'
b'IMB Scotland said the company has failed to speak about the future of investments at the Tollcross facility.'
b'The more than 500 workers are working in the factory that manufactures along with other products Hobbies and Rich Tea Cookies.'
b'Ivities owner Pladis said he has invested more than \xc2\xa35 million.'
b'I added that employees and civil servants would "be the first to know" when their jobs change.'
b'"In a letter addressed to the Filiale of the company, GMB Scotland McVitie\'s requested that the financing for the modernisation of production lines be not pursued."'
b'IMB Executive Director Drew Duffy, said: "The fact that we can\'t gain from the General Manager any clarity on the business needs and investment plans for the future of Tollcross affects our members to a great extent.'
b'The vast majority of families have worked here and the workforce focuses heavily on the local community and the Greater Glasgow area, a vital hub for men\xe2\x80\x99s employment in a region with high levels of poverty and social exclusion.'
b'I needed under the perspective of jobs, the pay and welfare, and ahead of Brexit, rising living standards and the chronic production decline, the northern end of Glasgow needed a florist production presence at McVitie.'
b'The spokesman for Pladis said: "The branch manager at Tollcross has just received a letter from GMB Scotland, and the company will immediately respond as we appreciate the ongoing commitment to employees and union members.'
b'I had a regular meeting with staff and GMB representatives at Tollcross, where some questions were discussed openly.'
b'I discussed with the staff that we as all companies operating in a highly competitive and uncertain economic climate, need to monitor our business continuity - and this applies to all our operations and locations - to remain competitive.'
b'It added: "In recent years, we have invested in our Tollcross facility more than \xc2\xa35 million, including in production lines and operational improvements.'
b'"We recognize the history of Tollcross as a manufacturing facility fully. Should our operations change at the location, the employees and their unions will be the first to know."'
b'It was the Saints Barcelona that were warned three years ago about Neymar?'
b'The side of La Liga may regret their interest in Marco Verratti'
b'The Saints won\xe2\x80\x99t be following in their vow of Neymar after they dropped an offer of \xc2\xa3189 million to clear his suspension, but have they warned Barcelona three years ago before the World Cup?'
b'The sensational move has boosted the transfer window in summer, as the Ligue-A champions are ready to break the world record by more than double the previous record, although Paul Pogba has been transferred in the past season for 89 million pounds to Manchester United.'
b'In the end, Neymar will be the most expensive player in the world and the highest paid professional player in the world. Paris offers salaries of more than \xc2\xa3500,000 a week.'
b'It is worrisome about the way Neymar has forced his way out of the club, although a source in the vicinity of the Barcelona manager insists that the club has always given his best since his arrival from Santos in 2013.'
b'The football world was warned three years ago by the Paris Saint-Germain president about this prospect?'
b'The Manchester City 2014 interest in signing Blaise Matuidi had led Nasser Al-Khelaifi to a strict warning for any club that wanted to sign one of the best players of the Premier League.'
b'"I am not worried because they know that if they touch one of our players, then we will stand in opposition to them, we will contact their players," Al-Khelaifi said.'
b'I respect all clubs.'
b'"If they try to sign one of our players at once, this will have consequences."'
b'I seem to have crossed this line, although the Portuguese club began to express interest in the Saint-Germain midfielder Marco Verratti.'
b'This made it impossible for the International from Italy to travel under any circumstances, and Barcelona could feel the consequences of this interest by losing one of its price offers for Neymar.'
b"I've been thrown around and damaged"

b'If you witness an accident on the highway 215 between Stolzenau and Leese, the police are looking for witnesses.'
b'Ignoring a car on his roadside, the driver of a Volkswagen Touran drove away and touched the Leiter Plane.'
b'The 34-year-old from Rehoboth-Loccum was traveling with his truck at about 19.55pm on the B295 from Stolzburg to Leese.'
b'The area of Stolzenau was approached by a truck on its roadway, so he had to turn left.'
b"I touched the touring car's Leiter."
b'In the meantime, the Pkw en-route was damaged.'
b'The driver of the opposite vehicle, a Mercedes Benz, had overtaken a Lexus and continued driving without paying attention to the collision.'
b'I can tell you that according to the accident victim well, the Mercedes driver hadn\xe2\x80\x99t noticed the collision.'
b'The police are now asking for any witnesses of the incident as well as the driver of the colliding vehicle to call Crime Stoppers at 519-792-6400 with the Crime Stopper in Stolzenau.'
b'"Dominion\'s brief endorsement endorses Pope Francis"'
b"The Regents' report on the sexual abuse scandal has been endorsed by Pope Francis."
b'I mean, according to author and historian Michael Hesemann.'
b"The final report on the sexual abuse scandal at the Regent's Cathedral continues to raise questions."
b'"Weisenberg, spokesman of the reform movement "We are Christians," said after communicating to the Associated Press, he expects to hear from former Regents and today Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig M\xc3\xbcller as well as from Domicile Gregory Ratzinger, the 93-year-old'
b'It would serve the interest of the Catholic Church very well if M\xc3\xbcller and Ratzinger expressed their deep disappointment over their own submission or their damaging interpretation of the proceedings.'
b'The Vatican\'s "Osservatore Romano" however argued that when reporting on violence at the Vatican, it should be measured with "worse measure."'
b'Ignoring the attacks in Regensburg, no one doubts that it was "criminal and damaging acts" that should be punished and in future prevented; on the other hand, the "great media manipulation," according to the author Luce, "is a'
b'"The anger towards the Catholic Church as the source of all suffering is already part of everyday experience and prepares the public to accept that for normal," says Scaraffia.'
b'The Forrest Gloria of Thurn and Taxis said in an interview with the Bay Area Telegraph: "You go to church and that\'s a found freak".'
b'"However," she said, in her teenage years, "violence was a quite normal parental tool," "to deal with freaking children, like I was one, to be finished."'
b'It would be unfair to apply today\xe2\x80\x99s measurements to earlier years as the world has changed.'
b'The reporting of the sexual abuse cases often included Pope Francis.'
b'I\'m sorry to say," says author and historian Michael Hesemann, who co-wrote with Ratzinger the memorial volume "My Brother the Pope" (in 12 languages).'
b'"I have to take George Ratzinger in my care," says Hesemann, "but all this had nothing to do with him," werting the results of the final report.'
b'In what exactly is the 440-page report that the Archdiocese of Regensburg has filed with the Commissioner of Justice Ulrich Weber?'
b'The 547 Regent\'s Chapels were bombed between 1945 and 1990 "with high probability" of being victims of attacks, 67 Chapels were sexually abused.'
b'The final report says to Georg Ratzinger, who served from 1964 to 1994 in Regensburg: "To date, however, it is also evident that from Domicile R. have been used in many instances forms of physical and mental abuse.'
b'It was at high intensity that the punishment for the students was even brutal.'
b'"In contrast to numerous other suspects, many victims felt the general humaneness of R. and therefore in numerous instances despite violence even felt positive memories of him".'
b"The interview explains how the final report on the miscarriage of the Regent's son-in-law, George Ratzinger, has been endorsed."
b'In Hesemann\'s 440-page report on the "cause of violence to protective dogs at the Regent\'s Palace," he gives a wider picture of Domicile George Ratzinger.'
b'I have seen many students raise their "Mental" level.'
b'In other words, he appears to be a choreographer and perfectionist who was despised handsomely when a Dom\xe2\x80\x99s performance didn\xe2\x80\x99t bring a top performance.'
b'I owe you as his biographer this final report?'
b'This Hesemann: If you want to take the time and read the whole 440 pages long report from the very beginning, you have to wonder why the name George Ratzinger is even mentioned in it.'
b'The book is just eight pages long and it is clear that any conviction of conviction or conviction of sexual assault will be free.'
b'The violence exacerbated at the preschool occurred outside its effect.'
b"I can't blame him all the way for being too late or first and foremost not being taken seriously enough."
b'The temple on which he performed was regarded by virtually all of the interviewees as - so to speak - "healing", "history" and "brighter world".'
b'It also gives the broader majority of his students George Ratzinger a quite exaggerated grade, describing him as "warm-hearted", "beautiful", "comfortable", "comfortable" and "politically correct", as a highly well-educated teacher who'
b'The minority complained about his perfectionism and his high emotional sensitivity, which also led to whining.'
b'The fact that he was not only hitting stones and throwing the keys on the floor, but also throwing earrings and all manner of freaking boys at the hair or ears has been tolerated, to no avail.'
b'In his honor, however, it must be remembered that such interventions were widespread in the fractured 1960s and 1970s, at parents as well as teachers.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cDo you also have those Z\xc3\xbcndchen-Methods?\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'I, I think every one of us born before 1968.'
b'I have experienced this yet again in a welcoming school, a state school.'
b'I agree with what is supposed to be said in this report, that the ensuing sexual abuse and the violence exacerbated on the preschool, are free to be bagatellised.'
b'I wonder if it has anything to do with his reputation and his role as the brother of Benedict XVI that many media are just screaming at him.'
b"I'm sure you're working with many who never understood him yet still either way."
b'The truth though is: The report enlightens George Ratzinger in every way possible!'
b'In the media, in the wake of the report, there has been very much talk about the issue of abuse at the Regent\xe2\x80\x99s Chapel.'
b'I wonder if Georg Ratzinger in the final report also has any guilty or conviction in relation to sexual assault?'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cHesemann: Ganz klar,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.'
b'The only one of the 67 victims of sexual assault claims to have been the Domicile.'
b'It was once the parents were admitted.'
b'"I have never been afraid to speak with my father or my mother about it," said a victim consciously for the others, "It was all very petty."'
b'I believe the real problem with surveillance of sexual abuse was and is yet to be that the majority of victims are from shame.'
b'I don\xe2\x80\x99t think they had any parents and siblings at all, then quite possibly not a choir director who was supposed to be some sort of colleague of the murderer.'
b'This belongs to the Catholic Church\xe2\x80\x99s role in the Missile Crisis?'
b'The Heseman: A concerned student stated it as follows: "Because of sexual abuse... I... see... no case where auspiciously, he (George Ratzinger) would have had time to make informed decisions and have kept the respective victim on the safe side.'
b'I agree... even if it is really absurd to assume that from him... Bubbas have opened up a lot more clearly or even more openly than their parents, interns, trustees etc.'
b'"If you talk to him about sex... - unthinkable."'
b'The report comes to the quite clear conclusion: "The fact that him in front of affected students and/or their families were at risk was not confirmed in the course of the investigation".'
b'The sexual abuse of minors is Georg Ratzinger also entitled to any conviction.'
b'I may also not be accused of not preventing him or bringing him to trial.'
b'I also have no reason to associate my good name with these wider-ranging crimes, as it has happened in some cases.'
b'In the media, there was much talk of "glamorous scenery" at the Regent\'s Palace.'
b'The former Catholic priest George Ratzinger is referred to in the report "Weekly".'
b'I suppose he could live with this accusation?'
b'This Hesemann: That\xe2\x80\x99s the big issue, that in reporting everything was missed and misplaced to create a massive mess of sexual abuse and violence exacerbated and somewhere, right there, George Ratzinger.'
b'The exact same is again a misconception of the report.'
b"It's actually cleaned up: Between the Preschool and the College of the Domingues, between sexual abuse and violence exacerbated by the school as well as, say, other allegations."
b'The report discusses incidents from 1945, also from four decades in which George Ratzinger was not choir director of the Cathedral.'
b'I wholeheartedly apologize to the PBS, the cases in which K-12 students were abused by sarcastic teachers routinely schizophrenic and maltreated and suffered darunter litter, all occurred on the preschool in Ettersburg and the school in the same'
b'It had nothing to do with Dom Pastor Georg Ratzinger, for he got the boys to face him when they were already on the Domspawn gymnasium.'
b'The subject was, as the most prominent witnesses insisted, the subject of "preschool."'
b'I was just happy to be her enemy and enjoyed the so much better treatment and for many even "paranormal" circumstances.'
b'I was going to be different on the Dom\xe2\x80\x99s gymnasium?'
b'Ihemann: There was some disrespect, but just no sadistic violence.'
b'The same is true for George Ratzinger, when the report comes to the conclusion that "some victims cherished the general humanity of R. and therefore in numerous instances despite violence even associate positive memories with him".'
b'It remains at least the presumption to have looked away.'
b'This despite all efforts, the report only defined two periods in which he was informed of the circumstances on the preschool.'
b"The first time was 1970/71, when he was just beginning to develop and from the previous years at a school where he didn't act and be responsible (so the witness) didn't hear anything, and then only again around 1993."
b'It closed George Ratzinger\xe2\x80\x99s doors before the tides of konseyed the ears?'
b'The Heseman: No, because already 1989 he wrote a letter to the Director of the Catholic High School, which the report even reproduces.'
b'Iin weighed in on this, "that in the preschool, the punishment will continue to be the plight punishment".'
b'Along the way, he warned against negative press releases.'
b'This was obviously to a time when legal clarity was assured as punishments were also in place in California.'
b'Ivory erected themselves in a legal trap, as any of us probably know.'
b'It was also difficult for him to predict where the victims might have been overlooked or dramatized and where really the tolerated threshold had been crossed.'
b"I can't say he'd ever gone away."
b'I just don\xe2\x80\x99t think so.'
b'It was in 1980 that the punishment was lifted at schools even in California officially.'
b'Instinct Gloria of Thurn and Taxis claimed that it was unfair to apply today\xe2\x80\x99s educational standards to the 1960s.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cHow do you see this?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.'
b'Ihemann: We historians are talking about the "faith of the Anatole," which is the danger of judgement based on today\'s moral standards.'
b'I think the forgiveness has already come.'
b'The same does not apply to sexual abuse, which was to all the time abhorrent and even more so to what was done in the preschool at Widowed and abused children\xe2\x80\x99s seats, which goes far beyond what was then commonplace.'
b"This is all quite scary and I'm glad it's finally being worked on."
b'Along the way, I must take George Ratzinger in mind, for all this had nothing to do with him.'
b'The means of disguising and besting yourself, such as earring and pulling at the hair and ears, were widespread in the 1970s.'
b'The physical punishment then was also strictly prohibited.'
b'The image of his Regency time has George Ratzinger ever been re-recorded in the conversations with you for the book "My Brother the Pope"?'
b'The issue of punishment comes to mind too?'
b'This Hesemann: Well, in the book, it\xe2\x80\x99s about the life of his brother Joseph, also Pope Francis, told from his perspective, as the Doms played only a minor role.'
b"I didn't mention that he ran there a strict regime."
b'\xe2\x80\x9cBut even that must be said: Without this perfectionism, without that requirement of strict discipline, it would have been impossible for him to form from the until now rather nationally known Regent\xe2\x80\x99s Palace a institution of world class, true cultural ambassador of Europe.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'The keenness and Bonfire alone makes you from wider knights now a big singer and stands up for every success, no matter on what level, yet always maintaining discipline, passion and self-discipline.'
b'The what kind of person have you ever encountered George Ratzinger at the talks to her book?'
b'Hesemann: Through the work on the book and beyond, I really have come to know George Ratzinger really quite well and continue to experience him as a wonderful, humorous, fundamentalist, deeply religious and hermeneutical person, of whom you can\xe2\x80\x99t get enough of.'
b'I get regular updates on how many former Doms are still alive, 23 years after his Emergency, keeping regular contact with him, visiting him, reading him - he is almost blind - and treating him like a member of their family.'
b'The ones who have not conceded to him until now that he was once strict to them are also clearly in the minority.'
b'The majority of Doms today are grateful that he has blessed their lives and helped them discover the world of music.'
b'I remember that he was always a good, tender teacher - a strict father, gewiss, that may be - but yet a loving respectful one to whom they still look on and whom they just love.'
b'This please, again, be quite clear: All you are trying to teach him are educational methods that were at the forefront of his mind.'
b"I can't believe we've passed this time."
b'I think it is hypocritical to make a man, just because he is prominent and has a more prominent brother, to be the media scumbag.'
b'This is the blatant intention that is behind it, just all too obvious.'
b'The report, which has just been published, enlightens him.'
b'It would be the antidote for a 93-year-old man who has earned great respect and without whom outside of California and perhaps even America probably wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t know the Regent\xe2\x80\x99s Palace, finally in peace.'
