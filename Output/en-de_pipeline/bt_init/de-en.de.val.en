b'\xe2\x80\x9cHe has taken over the elderly farm and beefs this without chemical fertilizers and fertilizers, even though he does not have a bio farm,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.'
b'The Mayor Thomas Schneider was clear: "The local community has recognized the importance of the Weidezaun project and is pleased with the Leader funding".'

b'Ich hoffe that with that, the surveillance of the area could be extended a lot further.'

b'\xe2\x80\x9cThe total cost was $71,500, of which $71,500 was raised through Leaders, a fourth was donated to the village of Fischerbach,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.'
b'The landlords spent 12 610 euros to invest in 16,2 kilometres of weeds.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cThe big advantage is the longevity of the zinc alloys,\xe2\x80\x9d said Schwendemann.'
b'The Kovacs said: "I\'m doing a good job, without landlords and landlords, it\'s not going to happen".'
b'Ich f\xc3\xbcr Peter Wei\xc3\x9f stands to say: "Hier werden the best foods produced".'
b'The Landscape Protection Regulation (LPR) of the United States allows the federal government to subsidise the construction of Weider walls.'

b'The White House takes the liberty of Trump to the Supreme Court'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cThe most secure sign of a Regiment\xe2\x80\x99s weakness is when they start attacking the statues.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'The Americans value these as much as any other - therefore the sorghumously instigated Sturz of Saddam Hussein on the Firdos Platz in Bagdad in 2003.'
b'Dash Miller, one of the key ideologues of the Trump administration, knew certainly what he was doing when he was a symbolic axe in a fierce debate with Jim Acosta of CNN about the proposals of President Trump to drastically limit legal immigrants\xe2\x80\x99 access to the United States with'
b'The fair to say, Miller did not take the statue himself.'
b'The hordes of boaters and Liberty Impressionists would have killed him if he had done it.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cHe considered their significance, and particularly the significance that was given to it, when the famous poem by Emily Dickinson, published in 1903, 17 years after the completion of the Denkmal, was added to his base,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.'
b'The Miller Acosta said: "I\'m not going to tackle a whole lot about history, but the freedom statue is... a symbol of American freedom that illuminates the world."'
b'Dashboard, on which you are referring to, was later added and not part of the original freedom statue."'
b"Ich liegt sage, aber wie he himself said, it's not really about storytelling."
b'It\xe2\x80\x99s about the timely resurgence of the oppressive words of Lazarus, the only ones in which a state doesn\xe2\x80\x99t just accept any old immigrants, but the desperate of the poor: \xe2\x80\x9cDearest, your poor, / your poor, / your poor, / your'

b"It did not engage in literary criticism - he made clear that these people weren't welcome in Trump's America."
b'The conflict about the significance of a statue is part of a broader political and cultural debate: It is in fact a conflict about the significance of America.'
b'Theus - and their friends who were willing to put their words after her death at the base - knew very well that they were executing a high-profile act.'
b'The sculpture should show the connections between French and American republicanism, by showing in an abstracted classical representation of the weaving of liberty.'
b'Ichus changed this meaning: In her poem, the weasel is not more abstract - she has gained a voice.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cShe gives herself a whole other name: Mother of the Exiled.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'The connection of the poem with the image is a brilliant feminist co-operation and a brutal attack on the American Native.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cJust like Lazarus changed the meaning of the Statue,\xe2\x80\x9d said the people from the right, \xe2\x80\x9cthey wanted to reverse this already long ago.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Dashner, a sort of Johannes of the T\xc3\xa4ter for the coming of Trump, argued 2010, that the libertarian statue is not an early Neoliberalism to bring the American flame into the umbrella world:'
b'Ich soll carry the Fackel of Liberty of the United States in the rest of the world.'
b'Ich solle not illuminate the way to the United States."'
b"It's strange that Limbaugh is here on something."
b'The significance of the Statue is entirely a matter of the Standing Frame of Mind.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cThe great phenomena of Lazarus was to see them as they were seen by the elderly, elderly, but hopeful people after long and often scary travels on the deck of ships.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'It\xe2\x80\x99s about seeing the world from the perspective of people looking for refuge and a chance to improve their lives.'
b'The Statue speaks to them the words of hope and welcome that they must hear.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cBut that\xe2\x80\x99s obviously not the perspective that Miller and Trump want to see.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'It does not illuminate the way, but the hate that is their only source of power.'

b'It was passionate and the real feeling that embraced it quite naturally was tremendous."'
b'The Commonwealth-Silver medalist, who will be competing at her five-year Olympic Games at the London Olympics, says it\'s "unprecedented" that there are 16 Scots in the British team.'

b'The Mannschafts-Captain says she is "extremely proud" of the fact that many of her Lands are not only part of the team, but in some cases will be involved at the Olympic Games and at the Finals.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cThe great thing about team captainship is that she was chosen by the other members of the team, so it was probably a big honor, but knowing that my teammates voted for me and voted for me makes it even more special.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cOffensively, I\xe2\x80\x99m very proud of all the Scots that make up the team.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'It shows only how far we\xe2\x80\x99ve come.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99re here as established athletes, athletes who want to climb to Podiums,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.'
b'Died my speech as a Captain?'
b'Died, I think she went well.'
b'Ich have only pointed out that we are in this situation very fortunate because we have a home-season record.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s also really important to focus on this home support and to benefit that we\xe2\x80\x99re back in Olympia.\xe2\x80\x9d'

b'The American Civil Liberties Union filed suit against him earlier this week.'
b'The Stab of Governors enacted the suit as frivolous, and the online commentary was full of a counterargument with "Nah, and?".'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s just Facebook\xe2\x80\x9d, said many people.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s important to remember it\xe2\x80\x99s important.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s particularly important when it\xe2\x80\x99s a type like Hogan.\xe2\x80\x9d'

b'It has the two-thirds majority of the 50 Governors of the Nation.'
b'Ich bin kein reaktion\xc3\xa4rer Hitzkopf.'
b'It has a firm hand at leading his nation and strict compliance with the principles.'
b'It was also very bold to use Facebook as a pricing tool to connect with his voters and play his hairy head after chemotherapy on his side.'
b'It is the blocking of individuals coming on to the side of the Governor - which is a public forum that is officially chartered and operated by employees paid with public tax dollars - unnecessary and ultimately dangerous.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cIn an interview with The Washington Post, Hogan\xe2\x80\x99s spokesperson Amelia Chase defended the actions of the Governor and argued that the blocking of comments is nothing more than a moderation.\xe2\x80\x9d'

b'The Post spoke with some of the real people who were blocked by Hogan.'
b'It\xe2\x80\x99s just real people talking with their chosen leaders: a teacher, a businessman and a pastor, no trolls.'

b'\xe2\x80\x9cI commented sternly that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to hate crimes and other current news,\xe2\x80\x9d she wrote in the comments section of the newspaper.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t value this idea too much, if a number of people take up the same issue, then they\xe2\x80\x99ll be seen by some more as a so-called collective effort and not as a large group of affected citizens.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Died the staff of the Governor\'s office as a "contaminated Spam-Answer", others would probably call it "Fuck."'
b'The Facebook-era makes it easy to edit a post by simply blocking a critic or a negative comment.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cThis is much cleaner than in previous times,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cif you\xe2\x80\x99d done the same thing that employees enrolled to collect newspapers with critical Leitmotifs and to burn or arrest demonstrators and bring them to prison,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.'

b"The EPA's chief executive leaves office due to the revised rules of Obama's Environmental Protection Act to reduce emissions"
b'The day after he was arrested by 15 states, Scott Pruitt, the chief executive of the Environmental Protection Agency, reversed his earlier decision to suspend implementation of the rules of Obama\xe2\x80\x99s Clean Air Act to reduce the emissions of smoke-related air pollution.'
b'Ichitt presented the change as his agency adapted to meet the needs of the state environmental agencies more conservatively than previous administrations.'
b'It did not mention the suit which was filed against his previous place in a federal court.'
b'It\xe2\x80\x99s about a deadline that was set for October for states to comply with the standards of 2015 for bodily ozone.'
b'Dieitt announced in June that he would extend the amendment to a year to give his administration more time to study the plan and to avoid "sitting in local decision making or impacting the economy".'

b'\xe2\x80\x9cIn a amnesty statement, President Donald Trump suggested that his knee-jerk approach to Ozone Standards could justify the willingness of the U.S. to cooperate with the states through the complex process of ensuring the timely implementation of the new standards'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cUnlike previous administrations, the EPA has often failed to meet deadlines for the implementation and then waited to be challenged by activist groups and others, and in a compromise to set the date for the implementation,\xe2\x80\x9d said Pruitt, who chairs the EPA\xe2\x80\x99s'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cWe don\xe2\x80\x99t believe in regulation by courts, and we take deadlines seriously.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Ich take also the law and authority that it gives us, seriously."'
b'It belongs to the statement of the EPA that Pruitt eventually will use his "obligation to expedite and all other legal remedies" to ensure that the regulations "are based on a solid policy and the best available information"'
b'The republicans in Congress are pushing for a comprehensive revision of Ozone regulations.'
b'Died in the last month, the proposed legislation will reduce the implementation of the rules of 2015 by at least eight years.'

b'The removal of the EPA - after our lawsuits - is a major victory for the health and safety of these 6,7 million New Yorkers and the over 115 million Americans directly affected by the smoke that is coming into their communities.'
b'Died in this case California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Minnesota, New Hampshire, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington and the District of Columbia.'
b'Die-Ozone occurs when chemicals from cars, power plants, oil refineries, chemical plants and other sources in the atmosphere react to sunlight.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cThe buildup of smoke can cause vulnerable groups of people serious respiratory problems, and each year contribute to hundreds of pre-existing respiratory illnesses,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.'
b'The public health and the environmentalists shook their heads over Pruitt\xe2\x80\x99s unexpected move.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s bewildering how much pressure it takes to get this verified step taken by the responsible for protecting the air that we await,\xe2\x80\x9d said Lori Ann Burd, director of the Center for Biological Diversity.'

b"It's 2005 when citizens return to Moore's Ford Bridge to watch the nightmare that two black couples - Roger and Dorothy Malcom sowie George and Mary Murray Dorsey - were murdered by the Ku Klux Klan in 1946."
b'\xe2\x80\x9cNo one was ever charged with the murder.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s really shocking that in all these years no one has been arrested - although we see them in our churches, although we don\xe2\x80\x99t know who they are,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tyrone Brooks, who works at the Organisation of Nachos.'

b'\xe2\x80\x9cHowever, it turns out, it was Harrison who prepared and ordered the murders,\xe2\x80\x9d concludes hereafter a FBI report.'

b"Ich can't build a relationship with you if you don't listen to me or don't listen to what I've been through."

b'\xe2\x80\x9cAnyway, I think it\xe2\x80\x99s very important to keep this story alive because we don\xe2\x80\x99t want to return to these times.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'The other side of the room were the actors Darrius Bradshaw and Nick Rascona, who play Roger Malcom and Barnett Hester.'

b'It is alarmed and confused.'
b"It's been too hard for me to work hard?"
b'\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d said Greene, still kicking back.'

b'\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re working hard to make this right, not just because of the game, but also because of the memory of the four dead people.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'The scene begins again.'
b'The next time Rascona says the N-word, he says it sharply and with precision.'
b"It's nobody laughing."
b'It ends violently and quickly.'

b'The woman, wearing a trance dress, stands over the corpses of the actor and leads Bill Holiday\'s trance song "Strange Fruit" out.'
b'The voice bounces at every second.'
b'It\xe2\x80\x99s about a hundred yards down the road where a group of about four-hundred-minutes-old audience members are crying and crying out for help.'
b'The audience is almost identical between black and white.'
b'The couple is originating from Ithaca, New York, to see the performance, many coming just down the street.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cAll of us have spent at least eight hours experiencing Georgia\xe2\x80\x99s wicked humidity when Brooks takes them on a pilgrimage to the graveyards of Malcoms and Dorseys,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cTo this point, the Lynch murders have been anecdotal, but now, when you\xe2\x80\x99re on the same land where the Lynch murders took place, the air feels tighter.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Died the last note of the song, Greene invites the crowd to get closer and to inquire about the Leisure Name.'
b'The hounds hover around their heads, registering the fake blood and the still body and favouring each other.'
b'It\'s not really dead", murmurs a little boy, as if he\'d want to remember.'
b"It takes some time to thank Greene of the crowd - and suddenly, it's over."
b'\xe2\x80\x9cThe actors throw the Lynch seat away and wipe their tears away.\xe2\x80\x9d'

b'We know that this is not in your heart.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cBut you did that out of a reason.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'The audience sits down with the actors to eat dinner.'
b'Died at a table, a white couple from Atlanta is angry over the aftermath of a black couple they just met.'

b'Ichansson of the Forensic Medicine Agency defended the accuracy of the tests: "In general, you can say that the risk of a child being undiagnosed is low."'

b'\xe2\x80\x9cBut always there are too few controllers.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cIs it just about the staff or even the scheduling?'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cBut weren\xe2\x80\x99t just the amnesty controls that have revealed the facts.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'The truth is however, that food fraud and criminal energy are never to be taken to 100 percent.'
b'It is therefore critical to a thorough investigation of such matters and the oversight to the courts in cases where convictions may exist.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cI have already repeatedly stated that I expect from the responsible governments a lightening up.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cIs the regular alerting at food-related incidents really necessary?\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'The consumer has the right to obtain only safe and pesticide-free food.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cWhen a non-tobacco product is used in the food industry, consumers are to blame.\xe2\x80\x9d'

b'It must be clear: The illegal use of the insecticide Fipronil in the breeding of livestock is not hinted at and must be stopped immediately.'

b'\xe2\x80\x9cHow do the financial regulations of football affect Neymar\xe2\x80\x99s move to Paris?\xe2\x80\x9d'
b"The rules that are intended to prevent ungewist spending by European football clubs will not affect Neymar's world record transfer from the spanish Barcelona to the French Premier League."
b'The consequences for Paris Saint-Germain may yet come, because the governing body that governs the European game has the power to ban teams from accessing the prestige Champions League.'
b'The fair markets established by the UEFA in 2011 mean that PSG will eventually have to prove that the transfer of Neymar was made without huge losses.'
b'Dash has agreed to pay 222 million dollars (262 million $) to buy Neymar out of his contract, and Neymar will receive a salary of several ten million dollars a year.'
b'It\xe2\x80\x99s some of the financial aspects of Neymar\xe2\x80\x99s move to France.'
b'Ichiro can withhold the money locked up so Neymar can sign and bring him into a galaxy of other stars, at least given the financing of the team by the by the energy reputed royal family of Qatar.'
b'Iche d\xc3\xbcrfen for the purchase of players spend lots of money, must do so with legitimate income sources that allow them to make the Break-Even Point in their on the pitch business.'
b'It was designed by Michel Platini after his election to UEFA president in 2007.'
b'It was former French players who believed that clubs that were in desperate need of success had taken enormous debts onto themselves and risked losing their support when banks or owners returned their support.'
b'Died in 2011, FFP moved away from focusing on the debts of the clubs on the monitoring of their losses.'
b'The change meant that the business model, which Roman Abramovich used to use 2003 in Chelsea - a club with potential and then invested to improve the team and build a global brand - was going to be a tougher affair.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cIn the current three-year FFP cycle, which runs through 2018, clubs may face losses in excess of 30 million pounds,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.'
b'Ichiro, who was suspended from the presidency in 2015, continues to lobby UEFA to cut overseas budgets.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cSimple yet, FFP is not dead and we\xe2\x80\x99re going to make the rules for the future likely to be even stronger,\xe2\x80\x9d said Andrea Traverso, who is responsible for FFP management, to The Associated Press in the past week.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cWhen the Paris Saints paid the buyout clause of Neymar in a flat rate, they can use the amount for payment over the term of his contract,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cWe have signed a five-year deal, so that the deal for the next five years will be in the amount of 44,4 million pounds,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.'
b'The first wave of FFP sanctions in 2014 has the Paris Saints together with Abu Dhabi, which is in control of Manchester City, faced the most severe sanctions.'
b"Dash received a fine of 60 million pounds (estimated 82 million pounds), which later was reduced to 20 million pounds - and it was an order to limit the team's players for the Champions League of 2014/15 to 21 players instead of the otherwise normal 25 players."
b'It is on the look-out for clubs that might try to overwhelm UEFA\xe2\x80\x99s financial surveillance by capturing their revenues through companies that are associated with the owners of a club.'
b'It would be a catastrophic company to sponsor the Saints if the value of the sponsorship would exceed the standard market value, would the UEFA consider this as legitimate income.'
b'It happened 2014, when the UEFA enacted that the value of the sponsorship of the PSA was raised by the Qatar Tourism Authority.'
b'We\xe2\x80\x99ve heard that a part of the PSG\xe2\x80\x99s payments to Neymar could come through payments to the Organisation of the 2022 World Cup in Qatar.'
b'The Paris Saints and Qatar 2022 have bestowed the 2022 World Cup on Neymar and a derive of such a deal would be easy to figure out.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cThe recent sanctions against PSG mean that the UEFA will be more careful with every attempt to comply with the rules.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b"The UEFA had no plans to hold talks with PSG over Neymar's transfer, said the people familiar with the situation."
b'It was under the influence of anonymity with The Associated Press, since they weren\xe2\x80\x99t permitted to discuss the PSG situation.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cThe latest published reports indicate that Paris Saint-Germain ended 2015/16 with a revenue of 542,4 million euros and a profit of more than 10 million euros,\xe2\x80\x9d the report said.'
b'The balances for the last quarter must still be published.'
b'It\xe2\x80\x99s expected that Neymar\xe2\x80\x99s arrival will be a seed for sponsorship deals, merchandising and jersey sales.'
b'It\xe2\x80\x99s estimated that the revenue will grow by at least 30 percent.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cThe spanish Premier League was clearly irked to see one of the best footballers go, and they tried to prevent Neymar\xe2\x80\x99s exit by claiming that PSG would lose the FFP,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.'
b'It\'s a clear case of"financial domination" with the club and the state", said the president of the La Liga, Javier Tebas, the spanish newspaper AS in relation to Qatar\'s final ownership to Paris Saint-Germain.'
b'The Arsenal manager, whose club is in the hands of an American sports tycoon, disagrees with the views of La Liga against a state that funds a club.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s the consequence of ownership and that has changed the entire landscape of football in the last 15 years,\xe2\x80\x9d Wenger said.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cSometimes when a country has a club, anything is possible.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cIt will be very difficult to respect the financial fair play because you can go different routes or have different interests when a country has such a large stakeholder to represent a country.\xe2\x80\x9d'

b'It\xe2\x80\x99s all about the marketing: For a chocolate manufacturer, it\xe2\x80\x99s a prerequisite.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cHow many candidates will be hired at the new recruitment,\xe2\x80\x9d the Swiss say.'
b'The question comes but only to Swiss manufacturers.'
b'The newspaper said Chocolat Frey is looking to renegotiate the contract over the spring of 2018.'
b'The sda was the largest Swiss chocolate manufacturer not available for comment.'
b'Ichkoladen-Tafeln has been serving the Swiss since 2006 at the start of their flights.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cWhen the Swiss signed a deal with the Migros daughter, Barry Callebaut in collaboration with Hug the chocolate toys were delivered,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.'

b'The airline works closely with different Swiss chocolate producers.'

b'The cultural artifact is equally an insult and a betrayal of our Facebook-generated era of permanent memories.'
b'Ich als Franchise feels like the time is running out.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cFirst Day of Camp\xe2\x80\x9d worked surprisingly well, not least because of its absurd humor (it encompassed an original story for a talking doughnut that was spoken by H.J. Benjamin).'
b"It wasn't that they weren't sticking to the core of the gag - actors mid-sized to play geek kids who will grow up - but they did manage to get the last part of the gag back."
b'Dash\'s "Ten Years Later", with his adult characters now adults, is less emotionally charged and his jokes tend to go more to the ginormous ginormous, including a riff on the Stalker movies of the 90s such as "The Hand That Rocks the'

b"It's six long episodes to go by, and the comedy is not quick or often enough."

b'The Bank estimates that it will likely be four years before this will reach the prices and economy completely.'

b'The Green, chairman of the Terrence Higgins Trust, said: "The priority must now be to get the study done quickly across the country and that no one who has a risk for HIV will be left out."'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cNow that the PrEP is available, we\xe2\x80\x99re on track to protect more than 10,000 HIV-positive people.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'The Hodgson, shadow health minister, said: "The start of the PrEP is welcome and overdue after monstrous delays and zilch of implementation by the government."'
b'The evidence shows how transformative this drug can be as part of our approach to HIV prevention and stop the transmission of this life-threatening infection.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cThis experiment brings us a step closer to understanding the benefits of PrEP.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cIt is important that this study is carried out as quickly as possible in order to protect people who are HIV-positive, and that it will help to make sure we get to the stopping of the spread of HIV in the society a step closer,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.'
b'Dash to the big life: Inside and cleave designers have transformed this little Earls Court apartment into a spacious home'
b'Ichne Leigh, an ex-banker with a passion for real estate, relocated 2014 from a large house in Knightsbridge to an Earls Court apartment.'
b"We're sitting in the first floor of a elegant Queen Anne Terrasse - and it's a sign of the new design that Joanne's bags haven't been packed and sold."
b'Ich grew up with my ex in Knightsbridge in a much bigger room.'
b'Ich was looking for something that was comparable to my price.'
b'Died this house in Earls Court, and she had the same high ceilings.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve fallen in love with her and at that time I made a deal.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'It was the first time the 1.000 sq. ft. home was completely overhauled.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cThis was a one-bedroom apartment with a loose layout - you had to go through the kitchen to get into the master bedroom,\xe2\x80\x9d said Joanne. \xe2\x80\x9cWe wanted to add storage and a second floor to make the generous decking area optimal.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Ich wanted high ceilings, large windows, lots of light.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cThat was my request,\xe2\x80\x9d she says.'
b'It was designed by the architectural and design studio Duck & Shed of Erfan Azadi from Nottingham to use the 12,5 foot high decking to create a home that was not only a development, but also a place to live for Joanne.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cThe deck was not large enough to hold two rooms over one another, so the architectural challenge was to create an intermediate floor in which you could stand.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Diefan had to think creatively to solve the challenge.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cThis steelwork is pretty complicated,\xe2\x80\x9d he says.'
b'We had to arrange the rooms so that they were stacked over each other without having to bounce each other.'
b'Ich ging not just to build a simple platform, but to make the steel so that it had for the function above or below the right height."'
b'Die Anordnung allowed Erfan to place two rooms in full height over each other - with lots of additional drama.'
b'It has a classic glass window of Retrouvius overlooking the glamorous living room.'
b'The mirrored gold furniture, silhouettes and vintage Serge Mouille lights set the tone for the program.'
b'The use of mirrors plays a role in creating theatre, space and light.'
b'The two ends are a shorter corridor to make him longer lasting.'
b'The mirror in the kitchen feels like a window into a different room.'
b'The entrances offer geometry units to provide space for all bottles and glasses of Joanne.'
b'Die the sense of a glamorous room can shut off the beauty of the living room when it is not used.'
b'Die-cast-back cooktops are nothing new.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s special about this is that it\xe2\x80\x99s a garage door.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cA little engineering went in there,\xe2\x80\x9d says Erfan of the stainless steel, furnished MDF tubing.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s against the wall, so it\xe2\x80\x99s when you lift the door up, very easy to gleam.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'The clerk of use of space and staging allowed Joanne to gain additional 16 m2, a second bedroom and a better layout.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cAt the end of the day, you\xe2\x80\x99ll be able to sell the property - or how your property is valued,\xe2\x80\x9d says Erfan.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cIn a rudimentary form, a property manager will appear and make a calculation based on the floor area.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cWe have managed to reduce the floor area and use high-quality materials to give the room its luxurious appeal.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cThe materials are the things that touch you and that therefore help to create an emotional connection in a home,\xe2\x80\x9d says Erfan.'
b"Ich verify that you don't love the electric sleeves in the walls."
b'It\'s important, but they don\'t play with your heart."'
b'It shows that a home can be enhanced by good design and increased square footage of something standard in something quite unique.'
b'The truth is, like Joanne, you might decide not to leave this place.'
b'Dieder k\xc3\xa4mpfens for a 500-million-dollar property investment'
b"The twins are four decades after their Italian family founded the Dynasty, in a battle over one of the largest estates Victoria's worth over $500 million."
b"The former director of the 'Carlton Football Club' and developer Colin De Lutis lives in a villa in Toorak, just three doors from his younger brother Paul. This has brought him to the Supreme Court to try to settle how her"
b'It wanted to retire from the family business, but a scheduling battle over the separation takes place in the Supreme Court.'
b'Died with her mother Anna, the twins own 38 properties worth more than $1 billion, since the family purchased 1973 a business in Smith Street, Collingwood.'
b'It was founded by the family Westco Jeans and grew to include a chain of 160 retail stores.'
b'It was purchased 1999 for 85 million dollars.'
b'The money was invested in real estate, and the portfolio of De Lumea includes now offices in the city centre, the developments of Brunswick and Sorrento, apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Buller, and shopping malls in the surrounding area.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cAfter a deal with her paternal grandfather, Colin - described by Paul as the "dominant figure" in the family\'s business - holds about two-thirds of the company\'s assets and Paul holds about a third,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cThis means that Colin owns property valued at 316 million dollars and Paul\xe2\x80\x99s property valued at 176 million dollars,\xe2\x80\x9d the court said.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cThe separation of property and cash has been a problem for Paul,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cThese of course have left him with the hinterland of what I thought were the best objects,\xe2\x80\x9d he wrote 2015 in a first Affidavit.'
b'Died Friday after several failed vindications, the first hearing of the Supreme Court was scheduled for Monday.'
b'The twins are now fighting to maintain control over the existing business - whereas Colin, as Paul claims, has been excluded.'
b'It arguments that this is not true, but weakens Paul\xe2\x80\x99s ability to manage some belongings incompetently.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cIn a early Affidavit filed by Colin, he says he hopes to bring the dispute to order.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cMeanwhile, my Italian heritage says that the family is the most important priority,\xe2\x80\x9d he wrote.'
b'The costs rise in the case, with Hundreds of pages with Affidavits, emails and reports from companies, including Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer, and with leading lawyers, including Allan Myers, QC'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cDe Lucia and her husband, Luigi, were Italian immigrants who operated milk and cheese shops from the late 1950s and early 1960s and in the early 1960s bought a business in Brunswick.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'It used the security to buy the Collingwood estate, in which Colin opened the first Jeans shop of the family.'
b'It says he started Westco there when he was "in my last years of high school when Paul was a little boy (under 10 years old)."'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cDe Lucia says she and Luigi, who died in 2012, hoped to give their property gently to their sons.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cLuigi said often to me that he never wanted to see the brothers get arrested,\xe2\x80\x9d she wrote.'
b'The other twins, Mark and Luke, are no longer part of the DeLuxe Group, although Colin claims that Mark paid 10 million dollars and Luke 26 million dollars.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cHowever, both Lukas and Mark were,\xe2\x80\x9d says Paul, \xe2\x80\x9cover the conditions of their financial separation verified.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'It has been very backwards, although he was a former AFL president and after a biographical memoir from 2015 by Eddie McGuire was the best friend of the television star.'
b'Diefax Media met with Colin and Paul DeLucia and their attorneys.'
b'The Colin answered by texting to say "I can\'t really say much", because the case is before the courts.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s very, very sad that my brother Paul has decided to kill me and cast our family name through the courts,\xe2\x80\x9d he wrote.'
b'It was 2016 when Colin wrote to the court that he had tried to fulfill the demands of his brother.'
b'Ich h\xc3\xa4tten\'t expected that Paul and I would end up in our current dispute", he said and added that he\'s "immersively looking forward to a solution".'
b'Died Friday, this hope seemed to be over.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cUnfortunately, our case will be solved by the courts,\xe2\x80\x9d wrote Colin.'
b'Its new chief executive officer plans to limit media interference of President Trump.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ve tried to do it and we\xe2\x80\x99ve failed.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Ich kann John F. Kelly it actually do.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cIf he\xe2\x80\x99s the first, he\xe2\x80\x99ll be the first.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b"Icho reports that the new chief of staff of the White House is planning to restrict the information flow on President Trump's administration - including the reports of the news media - in order to keep the chief on a similar track."
b'\xe2\x80\x9cThis is a piece of reporter Josh Dawson:'
b"Died John F. Kelly, the new chief of staff of the White House, at his first meeting with leiteant employees, he identified a major problem in President Donald Trump's White House that he wanted to fix: bad information that instills fear in Americans."
b'Dash told the employees that information about him should flow - whether on paper or in letters - because the president would make better decisions if he had good information."'
b'Its diagnosis makes sense, but others have been trying to kill Trump by monitoring his media diary.'
b"The Trump administration's relationship to television goes back decades - and now that he's in office, his TV advertising is stronger than ever."
b'\xe2\x80\x9cWhen candidate Trump was criticized for an unfair reporting system, it was critical to show him that he was getting a fair reporting of positions that were to be convinced,\xe2\x80\x9d said former campaign manager Sam Nunberg in February.'
b'Ichos Tara Palmeri wrote to the time that "the key to keeping Trump\xe2\x80\x99s Twitter habits under control, according to six former presidential candidates, is to make sure his personal media consumption is a steal."'
b'Dashboards and Controllers, Inc., Inc., Inc., Inc., Inc., Inc., Inc., Inc., Inc., Inc., Inc., Inc., Inc., Inc., Inc., Inc., Inc., Inc.'
b'The idea that Trump\'s Twitter habits were ever "under control" is absurd.'
b"Ich know these campaigners know something we don't know - that Trump's tweets without their interventions would have been more potent."
b'\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ll probably never find out anything about the tweets that Trump hasn\xe2\x80\x99t sent.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cIf he\xe2\x80\x99s been able to make his employees laugh at him,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cthen their efforts have been worthwhile.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'It hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been deliberate to prevent Trump\xe2\x80\x99s contempt.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cPart of the problem is that the people in a White House that is composed of competing parties are trying to push their own agenda forward by presenting Trump material that may alienate their views of the world,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.'
b'Icho - quite familiar with this story - reported in May about the preference of the adviser, sending the president out of strategic necessity cluttered information.'
b'Dashboard was an example of what was described by Reporter Shane Goldman:'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cA lot of current and former Trump officials say that Trump is like a vulture on negative press releases, particularly those with bending leaks, and that he\xe2\x80\x99s trying to figure out where these originate.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'The incident occurred last February when someone threatened President Obama with a copy of an article published by GotNews.com, the website of the Internet Provider Charles C. Johnson, claiming that the chief executive officer\xe2\x80\x99s wife, Katie Walsh, was lying to the president.'
b'Dieter Johnson has been suspended from Twitter due to Schizophrenia or that he has not offered any specific evidence or that he has made in the past false statements and they have been dismissed.'
b'Died reading the article and favoured employees over Walsh to be interviewed."'
b'Ichmacher f\xc3\xbcgs that the then-Secretary of State, Reince Priebus, and the General Counsel of the White House, Rob Porter, "reluctantly agreed to implement a system to manage the paperwork and documentation that Trump receives".'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cHow did you get that to work?\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'It tried three months later to do the same.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cTrump will be a more effective manager than Priebus, but Trump is still his impulsive self, and his advisers are still looking for influence.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b"Die uncertainties make Kelly's mission very difficult."
b'Dashboarded criminals get post from Europol'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cIf the address is unknown, we will be grateful for the support of the community and erring.\xe2\x80\x9d'

b'The experiences had shown that many illegal aliens were hiding at vacation destinations, according to Europol.'
b'Ich habe 21 posters for suspected criminals from 21 EU countries assembled.'
b'The 2016 website www.eumostwanted.com was viewed more than 2,5 million times.'

b"Died over a grave and returned to the 'Millionaires'"
b'\xe2\x80\x9cThe wohlhest housekeepers of the West Midlands are back with some enthusiastic travellers on battlefield,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99ve negotiated one of the village\xe2\x80\x99s graveyards to get a field before their men\xe2\x80\x99s houses.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'The travellers have parked their 20 homes on a field outside of a well-known street of Solihull, which is known as the "Millionaire\'s Road."'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cWe have horses, babies and an army of transporters with us after they were released early in May, without however being threatened by a vomit from the Rat\xe2\x80\x99s grave,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.'
b'The taker group found a gap in the defenses and pushed their vehicles through a section that was unhindered to find a way out.'
b'The residents have been threatened by the councillor of Solihull, who said it was "necessary to deal with the problem".'
b'The anonymous resident said: "They\'ve been evacuated from Bentley Heath, where they\'ve thrown stones on the passengers.'
b'The Rat must be motivated by shame to implement in action, since he was unable to do so at the time of the problem.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cThe travellers were there in May, were further motivated and are now back.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Ich kamen gestern Abend an, probably today more."'
b'It added: "The Rat of Birmingham knows how to deal with it by holding long-term subscriptions to protect their parks."'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cI live on the Streetsbrook Road and I\xe2\x80\x99m not happy to continue paying my local tax when the council can\xe2\x80\x99t even stop it.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'The anxious resident, who did not want to be named, said: "It\'s ridiculous, we\'ve just seen the final round of these travelers, just to be blown away by another round."'
b'The numbers have increased this year and you\'ve even seen a horse in the park."'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cWe are aware of an unidentified camp on the land beyond the Streetsbrook Road and work closely with the police of Solihulls. We\xe2\x80\x99ll take the necessary legal steps to get them out as soon as we can,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cTo support our evidence collection efforts, it is very important that m\xc3\xb6glichst many residents report an anti-social or criminal behaviour to the police, by calling 101.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'It helps to build a picture of the situation in which the court must review when we file our case."'
b'Die Birkenhof wird Waldhotel Luise'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cThe former Hotel Birkenhof will be the Waldhotel Luise.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cThe house at Freudenstadt is currently being renovated and will be open to the public by the end of March next year,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.'
b"It's good news for the city."
b'Died with the closing of the Birkenhof by the damaging Ambiente Betriebsgesellschaft mbH on April 13, 2014, its revenues were estimated to be $30 million a year and even $50 million through the Kurtz Tax.'
b'The fall of 2014 saw dramatic increases in the number of asylum seekers arriving in the county, and the hotel was offered to the Land Commission as a safer place to stay, raising controversy.'
b'The city prevented the subsidy of asylum seekers through the establishment of a bedding plan to secure the area as a hotel.'
b'The decision was never made in the local council.'
b'It was at the time that Freudenstadt\xe2\x80\x99s Mayor Julian Osswald defended the hotel and spoke already of serious interest in the property.'
b'Ich sollte Recht behalten.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cThe Group\xe2\x80\x99s Luise Hotel with headquarters in Bad Bergzabern has acquired the former Hotel Birkenhof at a voluntary auction in Berlin and wants to turn it into a property of the three-star-plus category under the name Waldhotel Luise.\xe2\x80\x9d'

b'Died two of them in Bad Bergzabern and one in Bad Herrenalb.'

b'\xe2\x80\x9cThe Waldhotel Luise with its about 60 rooms will be breitling,\xe2\x80\x9d explains Scherer.'
b'The individual travellers, groups or business travellers are expected to feel comfortable in the hotel.'
b'Ich habe schone mit OB Julian Oswald und Tourism Director Michael Krause gef\xc3\xbchrt, so Scherer.'
b'The visions of the city were decently similar to those of the hotel group.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re on the same line.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'It\xe2\x80\x99s the amount of investment questioned, but Thomas Scherer doesn\xe2\x80\x99t want to make any specifics.'

b'Dashboard-Affairs: US Special Agents Set Grand Jury aside'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cIn the Russia investigation,\xe2\x80\x9d Mueller said, Special Counsel Robert Mueller had used a Grand Jury to review the investigation.'

b'\xe2\x80\x9cThe newspaper rejected the move as a sign that Mueller\xe2\x80\x99s investigations have been expanded and intensive,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.'
b"It was reported that there had already been first advances of the committee in relation to a meeting between Trump's oldest son and a Russian ambassador."

b'\xe2\x80\x9cBut that\xe2\x80\x99s not going to mean that the Grand Jury will be at the end of the process to decide on the erection of an accusation,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.'

b'Died in the wake of new revelations, President Donald Trump used a speech in West Virginia to portray the Russian collusion as a campaign of his political opponents.'

b'The detractors who refuse to sign up are the Nobel Peace Prize-winning organization Medical Research Without Frontiers (MSF).'

b'Died at this time, in the shadow of their own tragedy, they came together to talk about security.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ve been told that it\xe2\x80\x99s important to change their routines,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.'
b'The high-profile journalists discuss what feels more secure: They may have to take their kids with them to the office that was the target of an attack with pesticides, or keep them home.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cExperts have written three words on a table at the front of the room: Attackers, Neutrals, Rebels.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Ichigo asks the reporters to name names for each column - no evidence is needed, observations and guesswork sufficient.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cThere are drug dealers, politicians, businessmen, journalists who are accused of being on the payroll of the government or the Kartelle, a catalog of criminals that make the chaos of Mexico dangerous.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s no pause from the violence, and while in the whole country the corpses are dying, there are always more journalists involved: at least 25, since President Enrique Pena Nieto took office in 2012. 589 journalists have been arrested after attacks and threats under federal law'
b'The last is her creator and her inspiration from Riodoce, the Mitch Cardenas.'
b'It\'s the biggest mistake to live in Mexico and be a journalist", wrote Valdez in one of his numerous books about violence involving drugs.'
b'Diez\'s lack of presence will be deeply felt even though his presence is everywhere - a large photo of Valdez showing his middle finger with the word "justice" hanging up at the facade of the Riodoce Hotel. Two reporters in the three-'
b'The workshop takes place less than two months after his death, and the reporters discuss their shared topics, the trauma, their Alpt experiences, sleeplessness, paranoia.'

b'Died at the most of the thousands of murders each year associated with drugs and organized crime, the murderers of journalists are rarely convicted.'
b'The Riodoce are still trying to deal with the violence of Sinaloa, although they are uncertain and although the Terrain now seems to be scarier.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cInformation about the murderers, without justice, has made the meeting to discuss the safety little use,\xe2\x80\x9d says Ibarra.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s very dumb to waste my time in this workshop,\xe2\x80\x9d he says.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cSo long as we don\xe2\x80\x99t know the reason, we miss all.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'The morning of the 15th May, Valdez left the office of the newspaper Riodoce in the town of Culiacan.'
b'It was only a few blocks away when his red Toyota Corolla was stopped by two men. He was pulled out of his car and 12 times fired on him, probably due to the name of the newspaper - the with "Zwolf" in the headline.'
b'Died in his car and destroyed it in front of him.'
b'Diez was 50 years old.'
b'Died a woman and two elderly children.'
b'The rumors neighbourhood of Culiacan are free to roam freely.'
b'Ich zum Thema Valdez gibt es praktisch nichts als Schweigen.'
b'It was Guzman\xe2\x80\x99s arrest last year and the release of him into the United States in January that made Sinaloa to be one of the bloodiest battlefields of the country, as rival factions here battle to fill the vapour.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cIt doesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter that in Sinaloa every day someone or several people are killed or that the cemetery is full of verzid, two-story mausoleums for drug lords, which are bigger than many homes for the dead.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Die for a minute that there is a state of "ruin" when only a cartel can have the control over the coastal state with its valuable ports and drug trade routes in the United States.'
b'The andspite of the fact that Valdez was aware of the dangers of his work, is Ismail Bojorquez (60), a co-founder and director of Riodoce, with the regret that he did not protect his friend.'
b'Ich believe that two misconceptions may have contributed to the murder.'
b"It was announced in February the publication of an interview with Damaso Lopez, an ambassador of one of the rival cartels in the war with Guzman's sons."
b'The publication may have hurt the sons, verified Gang members purchased each copy of the magazine when it was sent to newspaperskills.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cThe second mistake was not to allow Valdez not to be arrested after the arrest of another newspaper that had published the same story, to leave the country to his own safety,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.'
b'Diez was a legend in Mexico and around the world, and his death is regarded as a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists.'
b'Died so long that his friends and co-workers assumed he would always be there.'
b'It was 2003 as a reporter for Noroeste when he teamed up with five colleagues to start Riodoce and sell 50 million shares.'
b'The Sinaloa, "was unlikely to be able to do journalism without touching on the cigarette problem", said Bojorquez.'
b'It earned a reputation for the muttering and honest reporting, and the revenue and advertising took to the bank.'
b'The writers loved to publish hard-hitting investigations without fear of Zen, and the readers were captivated by a publication in which they could read stories that nobody else had to deal with.'
b'Died years after the founding of Riodoce, she received the prestige-worthy "Maria-Moors-Cabot" for her reporting in Latin America.'
b"The same year, Valdez won the 'International Press Freedom Award' of the Committee to Protect Journalists for his courage in defending the Mexican drug history wherever they went."
b'Ich gabred voluntarily to him that he had fear.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cI want to continue to live,\xe2\x80\x9d he said to the CPJ.'
b'The drug trade in Sinai "is a lifestyle", he said in October in an interview with RomneyTV.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ll have to do the job that you\xe2\x80\x99re assigned as a journalist to do - either that or you\xe2\x80\x99ll play the dumb.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Ich m\xc3\xb6chte nicht gefragt werden: "What hast you done at that time... why did you not tell me what was going on?"'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cThe Riodoce team misses Valdez, the funvogel who could flush like a pirate, the friend who was generous with hugs and advice, a teacher who knew how to survive.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Ich vertraute on his routine.'
b'It would always wear his hat.'
b'It would always go to El Guayabo, the bar opposite the office, and there always sit at the same table.'
b'It asks them: Was his love to Routine his death?'
b'The death has also forced her to question her own assumptions about how to do their work best and stay amidst the chaos.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t like it when you\xe2\x80\x99re working with their women, their kids, their clean shops, their local start-ups and landfills\xe2\x80\x9d, to move drugs,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cThese things weren\xe2\x80\x99t permitted,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bojo.'
b'The result is, even in the best of times, a high level of self-discipline and self-discipline.'
b'Ich vertrauen meinen eigenen Instincts.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cIf it smells wrong, stay away from it.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Dash is, said the editor of the Riodoce Andres Villarreal, that "food has a sense of purpose... and then there\'s the matter with Javier."'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cThe old rules, as he and others say, don\xe2\x80\x99t apply in Sinaloa anymore - as well as in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states that have a gifted mixture of lucre routes, poor institutions and poor governance,\xe2\x80\x9d he said'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cThe landscape changes constantly,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.'
b'Died the room where the employees of Riodoce attended security training, suddenly no cell phones were allowed. Days ago, it was revealed that spyware sold exclusively to governments was being used to spy on journalists and activists in Mexico.'
b'The two officers sucked up to the heat of 104 degrees (40-degrees) in the shadow of a tree.'
b'It was ordered by the local government to protect the offices of Riodoce in a four-story building in a middle-class neighborhood of Culiacan.'
b'Died in the scheme of things, some of the reporters wondered if these officers were included to the 50 percent of the officers who the Governor himself described as not trustworthy.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s been months since the reporters have been in the mountains where the drug cartels are de facto under control.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'The edition of this week has Riodoce on three main stories.'
b'Died the brother of legendary boxer Julio Cesar Chavez in Sinaloa.'
b'It also included an excerpt to the state budget that focused on the hometown of the Governor.'
b'It was a group of men who were in one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan, a block away from the office of the prosecutor.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cThere was no official word on who enrolled or how it happened, so there was time to write what everyone in the city knows: that the restaurant is a favorite place of drug dealers and police officers.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cThe Reporter heard from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politician who is a member of the Institutional Revolution Party (IRP), which has dominated almost all political parties,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.'
b"It's reported that several PRI officials have been arrested for high-profile cases of bribery."
b'Ichreal batted out reporters to write about previous incidents in this restaurant, including one in which a son of "El Chapo" Guzman was killed during a military operation.'
b'Died few months ago, the readers would have regarded the column from Valdez as the most accurate source of information about the kidnapping.'
b'Diez, 46, with the nickname "El Flaco" because of his slim body.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cNow, all the channels of communication with our sources are broken.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'The office of Valdez was transformed into a place for signs and banners to protest against the murder of journalists, because the employees have become something they never expected to become: activists in the name of the press.'
b'Ichinora Ramirez shook a few tears and went to a demonstration against a further journalist to the office of the chief of police.'
b'The Adame disappeared three days after Valdez was shot dead, in west Texas.'

b'\xe2\x80\x9cThe whole country\xe2\x80\x99s journalists are becoming louder,\xe2\x80\x9d he said in organized protests "SOS Press" on walks and buildings.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cThis morning, the director Bojorquez is heading to Washington and trying to collect international support for the Justice Department\xe2\x80\x99s investigation into the Valdez case,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cAfter a meeting with the Governor of Sinaloa at the time of the eruption of Valdez, Ramirez ordered the government to kidnap journalists and kill them because they told the truth,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.'
b'It has since been requested that she be recalled by the government again because she is concerned that her whining has damaged her objectivity.'
b'Diez hatte repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico were victims of organized crime, government officials and a egalitarian society.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cIn his last book, Narcotics Journalism, he wrote that reporters are killed not only by drug cartels, but also on command of politicians and security forces who were involved with the organized crime underground.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'The media watchdog group "Article 19" has estimated that more than half of the attacks on journalists were carried out by police and firearms.'

b'It appears that the murders have an abhorrent effect.'
b'It\xe2\x80\x99s hard to believe the death of blogger Maria Elizabeth Macias in the narrow border town of Tamaulipas earlier this year.'

b'Ichbarra, who once wanted to be a diva, admits that the drug trade is embarrassing him.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cMexiko goes to hell, and therefore I became a reporter,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.'

b'The graphic portrait of the fallen founder of the newspaper, whose middle finger was formed for whole Sinai, followed the employees of Riodoce his trail.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cHow can you even think to close it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bojo, \xe2\x80\x9cwhen at the same time that Javier was executed, the Praktikant called me to send them to report on the streets.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'The Dinosaur used Tarnung to fight his enemies'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cOn the first sight, it looks like a statue, when in fact it\xe2\x80\x99s an errant one.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'The researchers have found that the first findings of the incredibly naked skeleton of a Canadian archaeologist were so good that experts have referred to it as the Mona Lisa of the Dinosaur.'
b'It was so well preserved that they even found out that his skin was made of rubber - and they said she had something of an "unprecedented past."'
b'The report in the journal "Current Biology" described him as "the best-known geological dinosaur to ever be found, and one of the best-known dinosaur fossils of all time".'
b'It is a newly discovered species of Nodosaurian that lived in the middle of the Kreide age between 110 million and 112 million years ago.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cThis incredibly well preserved condition has led researchers to describe it as "very impressive"\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cAccording to reports in National Geographic, the geological plant is the best preserved fossil of its kind.'
b'The Shawn Funk was found dead on March 21, 2011 in the Suncor Millenium Mine in Fort McLean, North Dakota.'
b'Ich traf on something that seemed to be from the umbrella feathers, and begun to look closer.'
b'The of him discovered fossil was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology.'
b'It spent the next six years trying to find the wilde animal within the 2.500 pounds (1.100 kg) heavy erectile tissue.'
b'Die all this hard work is the finished result now ready to be revealed.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cIf you just look at the creature\xe2\x80\x99s eyes, you\xe2\x80\x99d almost think it\xe2\x80\x99s sleeping,\xe2\x80\x9d said the main author Caleb Brown, researcher at the Royal Tyrrell Museum where the creature is to be seen.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cIt will be introduced into the science as one of the most beautiful and best preserved dinosaur specimens - the Mona Lisa of the Dinosaur.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'The scientists have found that this plant-eating dinosaur, although he is wearing a helmet and a walking pantsuit, probably was hunted by flesh eating dinosaurs.'
b'The stark geological dinosaurs used a red and white stripe to protect themselves from raccoons, and used an absorption technique known as "contrast", which is also used by many modern dinosaurs.'
b'It would have allowed it to blend better in his surroundings and fight its enemies, say experts, which may have led to it being attacked by larger dinosaurs.'
b'The 110 million years old creature from the family of Nodosaurians has made headlines in May and is now on display at the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology.'
b'The scientists have now studied the wildest creature and it Borealopelta markmitchelli after the museum engineer Mark Mitchell, one of a team that spent more than 7,000 hours trying to find it carefully.'
b'The erratic preservation of the specimen enabled Dr. Mitchell and an international team of researchers to record the pattern and shape of shoe and helmet over his body.'
b'The colonists discovered the colonization, a common defensive strategy in the animal kingdom, which meant that the top of the creature was darker than its bottom.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cWhile the Kontrfraction is common, the results are surprising, given the size of Borealopelta at least doubles the size of the today\xe2\x80\x99s animals,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.'
b'It denotes that the dinosaur was given enough pressure by being eaten by flesh-feeding dinosaurs that the evolutionary system was able to reduce the constriction of congestion as a means of survival.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cThe most zeitgeist animals that use the colonization aim - think of reptiles, zebras or giraffes - are much smaller and more vulnerable than beasts, which signals that this nomad is going to have a real battle to overcome,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cStaring at a massive, starkly engineered dinosaur showing how dangerous the dinosaurs were must have been,\xe2\x80\x9d Brown said.'
b'The chemical analysis organoleptic compounds in their scales also shows that the skin of the dinosaur was white.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ll continue to look at the animal\xe2\x80\x99s life, including its remainder, to find out what it\xe2\x80\x99s been consuming as his last meal,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.'
b'It is believed that the dinosaur, when he died, fell into a river and sank into the ocean, where he sank on the bottom of the ocean.'
b'Died during this time, Alberta was warmer than southern Florida today, and rivers and oceans were probably much more widespread than they are today.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cThis nodosaurian is really impressive because he is fully covered with preservative skin, but also in three dimensions and retains the original shape of the animal,\xe2\x80\x9d said Brown.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cThe result is that the animal today is almost identical to that of the early Kreationist.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t need much imagination to try to recreate it. If you just do a little with the eyes, you\xe2\x80\x99d almost believe he\xe2\x80\x99s sleeping.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'It was a time when giant theropods, fleeting dinosaurs that were on two legs, ran through the Earth.'
b'Died the King of them, the Tyrannosaurus Rex, millions of years after Borealopelta lived, the geological dinosaur was slaughtered by some of his furry predecessors.'
b'It is called the Acrocanthosaurus, a 38 foot (11,5 m) long, six ton weight monster.'
b'The scientists whose latest findings appear in Current Biology believe that Borealopelta died in the ocean and was mutilated.'
b'The creature was discovered by Shawn Funk on March 21, 2011 in the Suncor Millenium Mine in Fort McLean, North Carolina.'
b'The museum is the best-preserved geological dinosaur of the world, including skin and bones, and is complete from the skull to the shoulder blade.'
b'The creatures were estimated to be about 18 feet (5 meters) long and have been estimated to weigh up to 3,000 pounds (1.300 kg).'
b'It encompassed two 20-inch-thick slits that ran from his shoulders to his chest.'
b"It's believed that the geological plant was flown through the west coast of Canada, until a overflow flooded it into the open ocean."
b'The underwater burial of the Dinosaur belonged to his body in exquisite detail.'
b'The versteaved remains of this particular specimen are so well preserved that the skin remains still to be holstered pants along the bones'
b"\xe2\x80\x9cWhat Michael Greshko has written for National Geographic is a level of preservation so 'normal' as a win in the Lotto.\xe2\x80\x9d"
b'The more I look at it, the more confusing it becomes.'
b'Died of the skin covers still the holistic pants that carry the bones of the animal.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cThe right front leg is at his side, his five fingers are stretched downwards.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b"It can count the shovels at his feet'."
b'Died in Gewitter: Masses of dead on A8: Many victims'
b'Dieftiger accident on Thursday morning on the A8: More than 30 vehicles are involved in a mass car chase.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cThere are numerous dead bodies, kilometers of traffic - and gathering.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Died at the scene of the accident on the A8, about 20 people were injured.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cAccording to first-aid officers, around 17.00 a.m. between the Anschlusses Adelzhausen and Odelzhausen (Landkreis Aichach-Friedberg) were at least 30 vehicles, including likely trucks, injured,\xe2\x80\x9d said a police spokesperson'
b'The exact number of fatalities were initially unavailable.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cIt handles minor to moderate injuries,\xe2\x80\x9d said a police spokesperson.'
b'It was a huge crowd of ambulances at the scene of the accident.'
b'The A8 was completely blocked off.'
b'Died in Fahrtrichtung M\xc3\xbcnchen bildeted sich ein rund zehn-kilometer langer R\xc3\xbcckstand.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cAs a AZ-reporter reported, there were also on the road massive disruptions - by numerous gatherers,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.'
b'The fire department notified the drivers of the vehicles, who now face emptiness of penalties.'
b'It was after 18:45 that there was another accident on the A8, this time between Augsburg and Dasing.'
b'The accident was caused by a collision between a truck and a pickup truck.'
b'The emergency ambulance was traveling to the scene.'
b'Die Bahn: Konzern testet "Komfort Check-in"'
b'It\xe2\x80\x99s a moment that almost everyone has experienced: Not knowing where you\xe2\x80\x99re going, you\xe2\x80\x99re sitting in the train and sleeping.'
b'The man is busy working on his work and has just come up with a brilliant thought.'
b"It's then: puffed up."
b'Die the guard and weaken an unsuspecting driver or pull the driver mittens out of the workflow.'
b"It's a cardholder check."
b'Die the times of interruptions are coming soon.'
b'Die Deutschen Bahn testet currently the schaffnerless ticketing system.'
b'It\xe2\x80\x99s easy to confirm just by phone that you\xe2\x80\x99ve taken your place and enroll in the ride.'
b"It's running a test run on two tracks."
b'\xe2\x80\x9cWhen the offer is accepted, we\xe2\x80\x99ll close it out.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'It will then be available beginning next year on many other ferry routes in the United States", said a spokesperson.'
b'The "comfort check-in" refers to the railway\'s ticketing system without a guard.'
b'It\xe2\x80\x99s free to use, but there are some requirements: You need a smartphone or a tablet.'
b'The driver must have booked an online ticket - which is what without doubt most of the riders do.'
b'It must also be purchased through the app of the train, the DB Navigator, which is already the easiest way to purchase tickets.'
b'The last thing you need is a seat reservation.'
b'The "comfort check-in" works like this: You get in the train, check your ticket under "My Tickets".'
b'It will then display a button to electronically enter the test results.'
b'The trains receive on their mobile devices a notification that rider X is in the train and has taken the reserved seat Y.'
b'The train driver at the ticket counter at place Y knows that there is a passenger with already enrolled online ticket.'
b'It can also continue to sleep, continue working, continue to speak.'
b'The "check-in" has two benefits: one for the customer, one for the train - which again will benefit the passengers.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cIf you want to travel relaxed without ticket control by our train drivers, check the DB Navigator for yourself.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'It allows travellers to make their journeys more personalized", says Michael Peterson, marketing director of DB Fernbus.'
b'Ichtes Plus: "Unlike today, our staff have more time than today to work on the individual customer\'s needs."'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cWhenever you\xe2\x80\x99re travelling by train, you\xe2\x80\x99ll know that along with delays and missed trains, the ticket controls are among the most frustrating.'
b'It often has you yourself, in any case but one of your fellow travellers, not having all the documents you need to enroll in online ticketing.'
b'Died the card or the Personal Identification Number or any other document that you have to present.'
b'The result is endless disagreements between train drivers and passengers, which can lead to bad moods in the subway or large area and delays in controlling the own ticket and giving the skipper at least the time to take care of other concerns.'
b'It can only be used by a small number of test customers to use the new service.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cThis also applies to the connections ICE 915 Dortmund-Stutgart and ICE 912 Stuttgart-Essen.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Ichigo trains on the same route are still not available.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cHow did a activist come to learn the answer to the question: \xe2\x80\x9cWhose Streets?\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'It was 9. August 2014 when Brittany Ferrell went down to her knees.'
b'Died a day after she arrived in New York City, the in St. Louis Geek sat on the bed of an Airbnb property she rented and scrolled through Facebook on her phone.'
b'Ich stolperred over a post from someone from the high school.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cThe police have just killed a 18-year-old boy, and it\xe2\x80\x99s still lying on the street,\xe2\x80\x9d said there.'
b'We were shocked to find nobody else had posted the information, so she shut down Facebook and opened Twitter.'
b'The user with the Handle @TheePharoah was constantly retweeting on their timeline.'
b'The rapper from the area of St. Louis was involved in the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed black 18-year-old who was shot dead by a white officer in Ferguson, Mo., live on Twitter.'
b"It posted a picture of Brown's leaked body, which was buried on the street and would remain there four hours."
b'\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s wild\xe2\x80\x9d, thought Ferrell at length.'
b'The death was for her and her community nothing new.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cI put my phone away,\xe2\x80\x9d she said later to Tweets about people on the Canfield drive.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cThere were photos of the police band and people who shouted, and of a man who claimed to be Brown\'s father, wearing a sign that reads: "Ferguson police are trying to kill my unborn son!"'
b'Ich watched a live feed where a police officer stood before a group of demonstrators with a belled dog.'
b'The other video, she said, encircled another officer\'s gun and shouted: "I\'ll kill you... animals all."'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s not normal\xe2\x80\x9d, recalled Ferrell of their statement.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s not the kind of murder that we\xe2\x80\x99re used to and that we can call typographic.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Died in this moment, I felt stirred.'
b'Died whispering and weeping."'
b'Ich busted a return flight and went home the next morning.'
b'Died at the time of the latter, she took her 6-year-old daughter out of the house of her father\xe2\x80\x99s and agreed that the two would be heading to Ferguson.'
b'In the following three years with Ferrell and Ferguson, is the subject of a new documentary film, "Whose Streets?", in the cinemas on November 11th.'
b'It is a story of survival and protest, of love and despair, of strength and the resistance that exists from the point of view of the people who live in the community and have filled the streets to ask for answers.'
b'It was Ferrell with her daughter, who wore a floral dress and a matching crown, when the two began a conversation that they had been having unconsciously before this morning about the black experience and the black condition.'
b'You remember how I taught you, when black people have to fight for that which they believe?" she recalled what she said.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re now going to Ferguson, because the police killed a 18-year-old boy and that wasn\xe2\x80\x99t right,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.'
b'Ich couldn\'t take her with me", said Ferrell later.'
b'Died today is a culmination of... what happened in the past.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cYou must know it and see it and be on it.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'It must be well developed, not just activism and organization, but also understanding the different layers of black experience and the black constitution and what we need to do to free ourselves to be free.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cWhen I have the chance to give her an experience at which she personally doesn\xe2\x80\x99t experience any ekstacy, she\xe2\x80\x99s not going to be the next black women\xe2\x80\x99s kid.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cI have the feeling I\xe2\x80\x99d be doing her a bad service, keeping her away from me.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'The first stop they made when they arrived in Ferguson was at the South Florissant Road, an area near the police department that turned to a campground as the activists waited for the possible non-compliance of Officer Darren Wilson.'
b'The Ferrells and their daughters were connected to a local businessman who made lunch.'
b'Died bereaved bags and helped to give them to demonstrators.'
b'It began to be a new kind of activism for Ferrell to take shape.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cMy activism has changed drastically since the 9/11 attacks,\xe2\x80\x9d she said and pointed out that she was as a student at the University of Missouri-St. Louis president of the Minority Student Nurses Association and focused on food security and reducing poverty in South Africa.'
b'Ich had no experience in organizing.'
b'It is all coming to an end."'
b'It later met Ferrell during an evening demonstration by Sabaah Folayan, one of the co-creators of the film.'
b'Dielayan said she and her cameraman Lucas Alvarado-Farrar wanted to "document" what happened.'
b'The question came to Ferrell in mind: "Would you document or try to find a story that you can use?"'
b'The skepticism was fueled by unprecedented cases of people being genured, often by whites - in a community that profited from their pain and their resistance.'
b'Das Folayan recently said in an interview: "We had heard that people who were born in Ferguson weren\'t conscious of their voices and we wanted to do it differently."'
b'Dielayan had already worked with the former co-star Damon Davis, a artist from the area known for his activism rumblings rumblings rumblings rumblings rumblings rumblings rumblings rumblings rumblings rumblings rumblings rumblings rum'
b'Their engagement brought Ferrell the project closer, together with six other locals following the team of "Whose Streets?" in the years following Brown\'s arrest.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cThis documentary is not someone talking to us or talking to us. We\xe2\x80\x99re talking\xe2\x80\x9d, said Davis.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cThat was the main concern for me, how these people will be portrayed, because so I will be portrayed.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b"The goal was not to focus on Ferrell's experience - to show that it was not about a Messiah-fighting movement, but a community that is united together, said Folayan - she was recognized as the most open-minded attendee"
b'The follow-up to "Whose Streets?" reveals personal aspects of Ferrell\'s life as she tries to get married and her wife heires.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cI felt like naked,\xe2\x80\x9d Ferrell said and lamented when she saw the finished product for the first time.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cAfter all, I have understood that at this work and at the conviction of black people, there must be some morality.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b"It also revisits Ferrell's story of the role of black women in the broad Black Lives Matter movement."
b'\xe2\x80\x9cThe three founders of the movement, which led to the murder of Trayvon Martin in 2012, have inspired the film \xe2\x80\x9cBlack Lives Matter\xe2\x80\x9d in social media, identifying as black.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cSchwarze, black women in leadership positions have shaped the movement overall,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ferrell, \xe2\x80\x9cand therefore we are constantly fighting at different fronts.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Died, white women must carry the main burden of all."'
b'Dielayan rejected, saying that "the movement really is being led by black women and many black women on the streets".'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cThis isn\xe2\x80\x99t an affirmative type of action,\xe2\x80\x9d says Ferrell because of her identity as the heart of the film.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cShe was the person who was pushing this energy onto me,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s no surprise, though she was at the front of the line, because at a lifetime at these crossroads as a black, white woman, there\xe2\x80\x99s so much on the line.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cYou can feel their energy through the screen.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Died the news cameras in Ferguson long ago, but the rascal ties between the community and the police continue to exist.'
b'It is on hold for 21\xe2\x81\x842 years due to blockage of a road at a demonstration.'
b'It describes the societal atmosphere of the place she calls home: "A Chaos".'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cShe klauns at a choir and she feels this commitment to this choir since she was arrested three years ago in Ferguson on the streets,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cIt is our duty to fight for our freedom.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cIt is our duty to win.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cWe must love each other and support each other.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cWe have nothing to lose - except our chains.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Dashboards from "Training Day" to "Groundhog Day": TV viewers debate over Bit-Gallery'
b"The Bit-Gallery moves the people, even though it's still not built."
b'The idea of a shopping mall at the south end of the pedestrian bridge has divided the community since its first presentation in 2009 in supporters and opponents.'
b'Diet leaves the topic barely any one.'
b'It\'s on our Facebook page "Volunteer Bitburg" to discuss the topic.'
b'Dash to the Bit-Gallery: "This would be a dream" (Anja Becker) or "This would be awesome" (Nicole Schausten), comes from the other side: "Brave no human being" (Siggy Betzen) or quite simply: "Great'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99re trying to build a galleries to draw more customers into the city, whereas the rest of the shops benefit,\xe2\x80\x9d said the opposition, adding that then the pedestrian zone will be outnumbered.'
b'It\xe2\x80\x99s important to note that the galleries will be exactly on the property where the farmhouse is located, in which 13 direct-to-consumer stores will be selling their products.'
b'The beginning of the construction will be damit ended.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cGallery-makers want to incorporate a market in the new building - and we\xe2\x80\x99re going to make it to Beda\xe2\x80\x99s roof with room to sit outside.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Die Zimmer: "We\'ve been buying corn almost every week in the farmer\'s market hall.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cWe love our eggs, but also the delicious cakes of the landlords always enjoy them very much.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Die the Metzger has been formed for us.'
b'We would like to see that even during and before the construction of the Galerie there is a chance to maintain this offer.'
b'The other cities do have that too.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cAll in all the small market hall in downtown is interesting.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Died Densing: "Obviously, if you\'re a direct seller in a market hall in the galleries, it comes down to the value of the rent."'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cAt least at the new project though, it\xe2\x80\x99s going to be low.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'The Kilic: "Where are shopping malls in Bitch?"'
b"The Beard, Shoes, Drug Stores or Supermarkets: I don't think that's overrated."
b"You've already seen enough in our city."
b'Ich sieht doch, how many stores here are empty - some since months and years ago.'
b"It's here but not having a proper weekly market, it's important to us that we have at least the market hall."
b"It's always fresh, comes mostly directly from the producer and is obviously affordable."
b'\xe2\x80\x9cAs you can see, stores in a shopping mall tend to be rented only to larger firms,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cbut the local rents are often not sustainable.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b"Dash, specialty shops are almost nonexistent and that's all that's left of them."
b'Ich Fandel: "A shopping mall with a market place doesn\'t fit for me.'
b"Ich finde the galleries don't fit to Bitch's."
b'\xe2\x80\x9cAll in all: Where will the Bauer Market Hall during the construction phase be located?\xe2\x80\x9d'
b"It's old Ebay that would be the solution - even on a temporary basis, if the Bit-Gallery ever actually comes out."
b'Died the serpent Bit-Gallery already before they were able to shut down all shops in Bit-Gallery?"'
b'The Marquet: "This will just not work."'
b"It's a shopping mall that's empty, doesn't need anyone."
b'\xe2\x80\x9cMy personal opinion, it\xe2\x80\x99d be better to have a proper farmer\xe2\x80\x99s market, rather than this galleries.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cFor a farmer\xe2\x80\x99s market stall, there\xe2\x80\x99s no place left thanks to the wah-wah many - as far as I\xe2\x80\x99m concerned - sinnable construction projects in Bitch,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cBut for a farmer\xe2\x80\x99s market stall, there\xe2\x80\x99s no place left.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cWhen the Bauer Market Hall is kaputted, there will be another piece of culture disappearing.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Dash of similarity: Artist creates portraits with Chelsea Manning DNA'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cIn the middle of the Fridman Gallery in New York, there are many faces to be seen - white, black and blue, which seem almost identical to each other - hanging at cables of the desk.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'The 30 portraits were created by the artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg from Wang dresses and haircuts that she received from Chelsea Manning.'
b'Diening scooped up the clips from Fort Leavenworth, where the former CIA analyst was sentenced to a 35-year prison sentence after she disclosed secret diplomatic statements over the website WikiLeaks.'
b'Dashboard of the new exhibition that opened on August 2nd called A Becoming Resistance (An appropriate similarity).'
b'Dashboard is the product of two years of collaboration between Dewey-Hagg, whose Distinguished Interest was in technology, computer science and art, and Manning, a transgender feminist and wegweiser activist, whose verdict of Barack Obama\xe2\x80\x99s presidential election was'
b'Diewey-Hagborg has through the algorithmic analysis of DNA that was extrapolated from Manning and from the 30 portraits created, how someone might look with these genomic data, provided a sharp, if not something intellectual commentary not only to the form, but to the'
b'Diening, who was born as Bradley Edwards, but has been open about her identity as a woman since her Puberty, was sentenced to 20 years in prison, including six felony convictions, computer fraud and kidnapping.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cThe prison was undermining her image, so much so that there was only one photo - a glowing, black-and-white selfie, in which Manning is clearly uncomfortable sitting on a driver\xe2\x80\x99s seat and wearing a platinum pearl necklace,\xe2\x80\x9d'
b"The year 2015 Dewey-Hagborg came out ahead of the big success of her 2012-project 'Strange Visions'."
b'Ichin produced the artist\xe2\x80\x99s portraits of foreigners from forensic artefacts such as cigarette smoke and cocaine, using the DNA from the sample to create a picture of how these people might look.'
b'It was the time when she received an email from a newspaper.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cThey did an interview with Chelsea Manning while she was in custody, and they wanted to do a kind of portrait to support this article,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dewey-Hagborg at a press conference of the new exhibition.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cShe couldn\xe2\x80\x99t be visited at that time and she couldn\xe2\x80\x99t be photographed, so they contacted Chelsea and asked if she wanted to make a DNA portrait.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cThe artist and her inmates became unlikely letters-mates,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cbecause they exchanged in two years several letters.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'It even included a by Shoal Kanungo illustrated comic "Supported Images", which predicted a future in which the President would reverse his judgment and she would be able to see the exhibit personally.'
b'It was actually only a few days after the book was published, Manning\xe2\x80\x99s release after seven brutal years in a military prison in Kansas was a welcome treat.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cBut there\xe2\x80\x99s also now at the opening of the exhibit something deeper and starier, as Donald Trump is launching a war against informants from the government and against transgender activists to find new, tweetable ways to tackle the starvation that he\xe2\x80\x99s supposed to'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cWhen Dewey-Hagborg was asked about the strange timing of all these things, she said that \xe2\x80\x9cthings happen out of a certain reason\xe2\x80\x9d.'
b'Dash with her oversized signature above (the "i" in her family\'s name is with a heart) called for an end to the "automatic splitting, whose basis is gender, race, and ethnicity."'
b"It's the opposite wall of their mitochondrial DNA sequence - a tautogram of Cs and Gs and As, written in Bleach."
b'Diewey-Hagghoff hoped by the incorporation of the 200 letters (or Nukleotide after the high-tech alphabet of the artist) to show how similar, at least in biological terms, we all are.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cWhat people will hopefully take away from this is that our genome doesn\xe2\x80\x99t care about who we are and how open genetic data are for interpretation and how subjective they are,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dewey-Hagborg, whose video of 2007, Spurious Memories, also'
b'The DNA can tell so many different stories, therefore this is 30 of these stories.'
b'The last piece in the exhibit that is kept in a separate room is a page from the above mentioned comic novel.'
b'It shows Manning how she can get a free phone in the hand of the Distinguished Distinguished Americans of the United States like King-Kong.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cIf they made your speech cold, then they\xe2\x80\x99ve won,\xe2\x80\x9d says it.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cAlso don\xe2\x80\x99t ever shut up the mouth.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cIt came straight from a letter she sent me,\xe2\x80\x9d said the artist who grew up in Philadelphia.'
b'Ich get GOOD GOOD GOOD GOOD GOOD GOOD GOOD GOOD GOOD GOOD GOOD GOOD GOOD GOOD GOOD GOOD GOOD GOOD GOOD GOOD GOOD GOOD GOOD GOOD GOOD GOOD GOOD GOOD GOOD GOOD'
b"Diening hasn't personally seen the exhibit yet - as is anticipated in the comic book - but if she should, then she'll be greeted in the middle of the room by the masks, of their own genomic simulations that look like"
b'It was also targeted, as well as everything in the exhibit, to the size (5 " 2, Manning Stack), at which their genes were written with Bleach.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cIn the past I\xe2\x80\x99ve had them at the wall, but I wanted to make them look like a peoplemen,\xe2\x80\x9d Dewey-Hagborg said of the portraits.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cI wanted to make it feel like a mass movement that was forming with Chelsea, like the movement that was behind her beating.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Died at Northwestern University and a faculty member of the University of Northwestern arrested for murder'
b'The nationwide human trafficking is imminent for a professor at Northwestern University and an anthropology professor at Oxford University, who are being arrested after a man was found dead in a luxury apartment in Chicago with deadly injuries.'
b'Died Monday for Wyndham Lathem (42) and Andrew Warren (56), who were convicted of murder for their supposed involvement in the death of Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranleau, according to the records of Cook County District Court.'
b'The documents say that Cornell-Duranleau, 26, passed away after several stabbings.'
b'It was published by the police department of Chicago that the leak was discovered on the 27th of July.'
b'The officers received a call, arrived at the Grand Plaza Apartments and found the victim with multiple injuries to his body.'
b'Ichl-Duranleau was still at the scene of the shooting for dead, and detectives are examining the snipers as a homicide, while the police actively search for the two suspects, according to officials.'
b'Ichhem is a professor of microbiology and immunology at Northwestern University.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cKick Cubbage, the vice-president for university relations, said in an email that Lathem is now in bewilderment and has been barred from attending the campus of Northwestern University,\xe2\x80\x9d the statement said.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cThis is now a criminal matter that will be investigated by the appropriate authorities, and the Northwestern University will be involved in this investigation,\xe2\x80\x9d Cubbin said.'
b'It is Senior Treasury Assistant at the University of Oxford.'
b'The University and Somerville College said in an email that "we remain in contact with the police in Britain and are ready to assist the US on any level."'
b"The statement also added that Warren's colleagues were stunned and wanting to ask him to step forward."
b'The Communications Officer of the police department of Chicago, Anthony Guglielmi, said he urged the suspects to call the police.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cThe police has an idea of their location, and our efforts to locate them grows,\xe2\x80\x9d said Guglielmi.'
b'Dieglielmi said local, regional and national police are helping to find the suspects.'
b'Dieglielmi said the police received a call from the building manager of the Grand Palace Hotel, who had just received a clue that in apartment 1008 something had happened.'
b'The police described the scene as very brutal.'
b'Dieglielmi said it was unclear whether the incident occurred on the 27th of July.'
b'We were told by security cameras that Lathem and Warren were in the building.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cWe believe that Professor Latham and the victim had a relationship,\xe2\x80\x9d said Guglielmi.'
b'The management team of Grand Park posted a statement to the residents: "The police are currently working on the timetable and background of the victim and investigating a number of possible motives, including a possible suicide."'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ll be finishing the WADA\xe2\x80\x99s roadmap in near future\xe2\x80\x9d - the Russian Vice President Mutko'
b'The Russian vice-president Vitaly Mutko said it will not be long before the remaining criteria of World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) will be implemented for the restoration of the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (RUSADA).'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cIn a certain stage of fulfillment of the criteria of the Fahrplan, RUSADA has the right to plan in cooperation with UKAD (UK Anti-Doping Agency) to test and test.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b"\xe2\x80\x9cThe WADA's schedule has been updated in this regard,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mutko on Thursday."
b'The PM commented on the second part of the Fahrplan of the WADA to comply with the Code of Ethics which sets out the criteria for replacing RUSADA and recently posted on the website of the organization.'
b'The Mutko contains nothing that could give Russia any reason to worry.'
b'It was announced, everything will be implemented.'

b'Diekos words matched those of Vitaly Smirnov, the director of the independent Russian anti-doping agency, over the years.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ve repeatedly said that the report contains umbrella positions and regulations,\xe2\x80\x9d Smirnov said. \xe2\x80\x9cBut we\xe2\x80\x99ve repeatedly said that the report contains umbrella positions and regulations.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Dietz hates to accept this report belongs to him", said Smirnov.'
b'Died in November 2015 in the wake of the Doping scandal, the World Health Organization (WHO) was barred from carrying out doxycycline testing in Russia.'
b'It was however permitted to conduct tests under the supervision of international experts and the UK Anti-Doping Agency (UKAD) to plan and coordinate.'

b"The Errett wanted to measure your employees' happiness at your ecommerce start-up, but the surveys did not work."
b'It was often vague, little helpful or - even worse - fraudulent.'
b'It even though you promised anonymity, some workers did not accept the process.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cIt was just lack of consistency and objectivity,\xe2\x80\x9d said Errett, who runs the 75-person San Francisco e-commerce hair care company Madison Reed.'
b"It's people from outside calling for help."
b'\xe2\x80\x9cThe new rascal of Human Resources start-ups is at the forefront of trying to help companies figure out how to make their employees feel.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'It is the creation and license of software that has the specific purpose of monitoring the employee engagement, it allows companies to conduct surveys, target specific groups and demographics, provide employees anonymity and provide complaint hotlines,'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cYou have now tools like Strava and Fitbit for tracking your health, but where is the Fitbit for your company?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Jim Barnett, co-founder and chief executive of Redwood City Start-up Glint, whose software-based fitness tracking tools are based on Strava'
b'Dierett said she said she was able to gain a better understanding of what your employees think and feel in the three years with Glint.'
b"Dashboards and surveys of certain teams provide a heat map of the company that shows on a one-size-fits-all basis which units have the most complaints and which leaders have low approval scores - so you'll be able to find out what units have the"
b'It comes to a point where you have to stay at the top of the workplace culture to make sure you\xe2\x80\x99re not the next Uber that\xe2\x80\x99s been involved in scandals, since a former Uber employee posted a blog post that describes an environment of bullying at work'
b'Die-hard startups like Glint are making this need for a visual representation a lush business opportunity.'
b"The global governance, regulation and compliance sector could be worth $ 11 billion by 2020, according to the financial website Let's Talk Payments."
b"Diever, Colorado, start-up Convercent, which helps companies to prevent bad behavior and recognize bad behavior, saw a rise in interest and activity beginning this year in response to Uber's failure in Missoula."
b'Dievercent has nearly 600 clients, including Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.'
b'It has been registered as a client.'
b'The Glint, allows Convercent to send companies aggregated "plumbing" surveys, collect verified answers in real-time and view the heat map of your problem areas.'
b'The company also offers an anonymous SMS notification system, with which employees can report bad behaviour.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cWhen the principal shareholder is involved, complaints go directly to the Board of Directors.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cThe court of public opinion has captured the Regulators,\xe2\x80\x9d said Patrick Quinlan, the founder and CEO of Convergence.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cWhen a company finds its employees are being treated poorly or unethical, it can experience costly consequences through consumer boos, employee complaints and lawsuits,\xe2\x80\x9d said Quinlan.'
b'Die Tuesday, the restaurant chain with more than 25.000 employees and over 500 locations, has been using Convergence for more than a year to ensure employees are aware of policy and procedures and have a simple way to reach their corporate headquarters.'
b'The next time an employee had a problem, he or she needed to find a phone number or email for the company\xe2\x80\x99s customer service department, submit a form of complaint and hope that he or she was taken seriously.'
b"It was often an intimidating and unpleasant experience, said James Vitrano, Ruby Tuesday's General Counsel, who said there was no good way to track complaints of employees."
b'\xe2\x80\x9cWhen the company converges, problems that were previously hidden from executives who worked in offices in cities or states - such as discrimination, racism or unfair practices- can be identified and addressed faster than ever before,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cI can get closer to this whole holistic, 360-degree view of the experience with employment,\xe2\x80\x9d said Vitrano, who heads the risk management group of Ruby Tuesday.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cUnless we protect our shareholders from employment-related disputes.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cWe started to take ethics, values and employee engagement seriously in 2002, after the bookkeeping firm Arthur Andersen was shut down due to ethics violations by the Enron scandal,\xe2\x80\x9d said Quinlan.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cIt took the "Social Media to their rightful place,\xe2\x80\x9d that corporations recognized that they weren\xe2\x80\x99t able to prevent that their scheduling was online.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cWhen the use of technology to monitor the evolution of humanity, people used hope as a strategy,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.'
b'The Glint as well as Convert offer your software as a service, and charge the companies back again for the use of their products.'
b'It is a business model and a chance to get the approval of Venture Capital Investors who have supported both startups.'
b'Dievercent received $ 10 million at the end of February from companies such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, which raised the entire capital of $ 47 million.'
b'Dietzern secured $ 10 million in November from Bessemer Venture Partners and raised his entire funding of $ 60 million.'
b'The investments come almost unexpectedly, at least given the dynamic nature of companies, culture and Venture Capital.'
b'It\xe2\x80\x99s a growing complex of research that shows that today\xe2\x80\x99s employees are expecting more from their jobs than ever before.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cIn entrepreneurial markets such as Silicon Valley, high pay and interesting projects are just anecdotal.'
b'The employees want to feel valued and respected and that you\xe2\x80\x99re giving your time to a company with a positive mission.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cIf the people are happy to work in a company that listens to their voices, and that the work you do is worthwhile, then they feel strongly motivated to make this company successful,\xe2\x80\x9d said Nina McQueen, Vice President of Global Benefits and Employee Engagement'
b'The investors reach higher returns when their portfolio companies perform well. Portfolios run well when employees are engaged and motivated.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cWhen the Analytics tools third parties promise engagement and engagement of the employees, it\xe2\x80\x99s no wonder that you\xe2\x80\x99re finding support.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'The data about the employee engagement after the experts of workplace culture are important.'
b'The data are numb when the controller of a company does not take action.'
b'The truth is, when a company employee asks for your feedback, it may have an expectation that change is on the way.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cWhen the change doesn\xe2\x80\x99t happen quickly enough, or even at all, this ensues entitlement and demotivation,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cIf you\xe2\x80\x99re going to ask for 4,000 suggestions, you\xe2\x80\x99re going to have to have 4,000 conversations,\xe2\x80\x9d said Russell Raath, President of Consulting at the business management firm Kotter International, which has seen companies falling too far behind on the sampling of data.'
b'Dash when you do not follow staff will ask, "Have you heard me really?"'

b'\xe2\x80\x9cwhen you don\xe2\x80\x99t care about me, why should I? "'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cReed, who now runs monthly employee surveys, was able to take action at the same time when a problem was reported about Glint,\xe2\x80\x9d said Errett.'
b'The aftermath of the sacking of feedback from frustrated employees was fueled by the speed of decision making and the quality of communication, in order to organize multiple teams within the company and add a communications scheduling system to deal with the problems.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cRuby Tuesday gives us access to new insights about the employees, and it hopes that on long term, this will lead to better engagement of employees in a sector that is known for high turnover,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cIf you\xe2\x80\x99re not trying to build a culture of transparency, you\xe2\x80\x99ll lose the people,\xe2\x80\x9d said Vitrano.'

b'\xe2\x80\x9cThis is going to be for the boys the next three days a real treadmill,\xe2\x80\x9d Bruins coach Jim Mora said shortly before the Monday was over.'
b'The NCAA eliminated two-day workouts to help alleviate the burden of the players, and they have actually extended their days - at least until the final game on Friday.'
b'It should start the first three training sessions of the UCLA by 19:15 p.m. to meet the already full time schedules of the players.'
b'The compromise away from the two days is more than a day when the Bruins announced the start of the camp almost a week after the last season and during the summer school for the first time during Mora\xe2\x80\x99s six seasons in Westwood practical exercises were conducted.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ll be doing in August 18 drills. 20 before beginning the formeal game preparations for their upcoming game against Texas A&M in September.\xe2\x80\x9d'

b'\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s a real problem, and it\xe2\x80\x99s not far-fetched to think that the people are going to rent a room and sit there to do an exercise.\xe2\x80\x9d'

b'It\xe2\x80\x99s 700 years of turbulent history that Scotney has experienced from his comfortable seat in the Bewl River Tal in Kent and is now to be the inspiration for a grafted novel by Jamie Rhodes, a mohawk-haired Yorkshireman with a preference for historical documents.'

b"Dieting of sex robots is real, and we shouldn't worry"
b'\xe2\x80\x9cAs you thought it wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t get any stranger in 2017, a new report is coming out about the technological advances in the sex robot industry.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cReally, actually.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Die-cast robots are currently a big deal.'
b'It was recently published by the Foundation forResponsible Robotics (SFRI) a report on the development of sex robots in the next five to ten years.'
b'The Noel Sharkey, emeritus professor of robotics and artificial intelligence at the University of Shefford and co-founder of the FRR, must start to take their upward trajectory seriously.'
b'Died the eyes of the robot, its shape of the breast and type of fingernails.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cThe people make jokes about them, but the companies deliver every bit of it, and we\xe2\x80\x99ll be seeing them more often than not,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Sharkey at the time of the release of his new report.'
b'The sex robots have grown from their on-board partners to robots with a silicone body that feels warm - with intentional human reactions achieved through the artificial intelligence.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cThe user can customize his robot according to his overarching beliefs and preferences and select anything from the eyes to the shape of the breasts to the type or color of his fingernails.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cBut it\xe2\x80\x99s still bewildering, given that many robots have the "perspectives" that would make a Stepford girl progressive,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.'
b'The sex robots have grown to robots with a silicone skin.'
b'The RealBotix robot allows its users to customize their robots based on the attributes they are looking for, such as security.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cBut then there are those of True Companion developed Roxxxy Gold Sex Robots with voracious personalities like "Friday Farrah", which gives the impression of scarcity and "Wild Wendy" with an "abnormal" personality,\xe2\x80\x9d according to True Compan'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cRoxxxy Gold has a personality that matches your personality so well,\xe2\x80\x9d says the website of True Companion.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cShe likes what you like, and she doesn\xe2\x80\x99t like what you don\xe2\x80\x99t like, etc.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Died in the middle of the day also had their moods - quite like real people!'
b'Dash may be tired, on task or she may be "in mood"!"'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cThere are many bewildering aspects to this upward trend of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the underlying weaknesses of these robots include an emphasis on rape when you make a step on Frigid (hei'
b'Their website compares True Companion Roxxxy with a vibrator, but for men.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cIf women (sic) can have a penis, why can\xe2\x80\x99t men have one?\xe2\x80\x9d says the website.'
b'The sex robots aren\xe2\x80\x99t just a toy or just another sex toy.'
b'Died and their increasing refinement weigh on something dark and deep in our culture, on a reversal of the ideal of egalitarianism to a desire for sex with submission as an option.'
b'The majority of men will seek to hold no sex robots, and while the FDA acknowledges their rise in popularity, they remain at the margins of the consumption culture.'
b"It's what comes out of the margins through which we live can be very helpful in understanding the spirit of the time in which we live."
b'\xe2\x80\x9cMany people are not intrigued or offended until they get the free market to give them the permission to do so.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s a certain overlap that these high-tech sex robots appear in a time when the rights of women worldwide are being threatened,\xe2\x80\x9d Obama said, \xe2\x80\x9cbut there\xe2\x80\x99s a president who\xe2\x80\x99s been praying for women to be sexually aroused,\xe2\x80\x9d adding that'
b"\xe2\x80\x9cThe abhorrent aspect of the television series 'The Handmaid's Tale' ('The Report of the Magnificent') is not the graphics, the masked body and the slitting eyes, but how realistic this vision is.\xe2\x80\x9d"
b'\xe2\x80\x9cThe Republic of Gilead is a Sprung, but in fact, this doesn\xe2\x80\x99t feel like a big Sprung.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'The goal behind these sex robots is to create a physical resemblance to real women so realistically realistic as possible (sometimes with pornographic prosthetics).'
b'Dieters want to make them feel humane, that they can replicate the movement of a real body.'
b'The robots, on the other hand, when it comes to their "personality" they are no real women.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cYou can\xe2\x80\x99t be separated from your companion or simply leave.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s no narrative or background, nothing that could point to unity or ironmanship or anything that would make the Phantasm total submission.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'It\xe2\x80\x99s been said: They\xe2\x80\x99re geek slaves.'
b'The way to put it in terms of 2017: Dienstwoman'
b'Ichs gro\xc3\x9fe Leistung?'
b'Dash of Mitt Romney to the Influence of Healthy People'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cThis is to be a Binder\xe2\x80\x99s Binder of the Trump Administration that the political collusion that has polarized the American public has also divided families in small ways,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.'
b'Died around Christmas and Thanksgiving, there were in the United States newspapers with advice on how to deal with the horror of Trump\xe2\x80\x99s selective voters.'
b'Ich strengened myself allegedly to clean up our filters.'
b'Died the power of Trump to bring families together.'
b'Ich mention this because my co-worker, a left-wing dichter who lives in Chicago and has been working with the republicans in our family, has been visiting me this week in New York.'
b'Ich remembered that the uniting against a common enemy can have a powerful effect.'
b'The Trump impersonator is everyone she knows, including the republican family, with whom she fought for years because of the policy, suddenly and completely different on the same page.'
b'Dieting the Estuary is certainly a good thing, but it seems in a further context that this also involves significant risks.'
b'Died from Trump\xe2\x80\x99s presidency, but the enthusiasm of his presidency has given us all the power to march forward.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cWhen we talk about "normalization" and Trump, we\xe2\x80\x99re talking about the gruesome possibility that we\xe2\x80\x99ll be able to avoid his mess ups one day.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cThere is however a yet another long-term scenario in which Trump Republicans are "normalized",\xe2\x80\x9d which on top of its standards suddenly appears to be an inexhaustible source of morality,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.'
b"Died today of a passive notion for Mitt Romney's urgy version of the villain - the dog on the car window, the 14 % income tax (but at least we knew how his tax return looked) - the two were both in comparison"
b'The next president of the United States must be physically fit to qualify as an unbroken improvement.'
b'Died when my co-worker was in town, we brought our kids to Karting in Central Park, the largest of the Karting shops in New York City, and the best three dollars you can spend in the city if you don\xe2\x80\x99t need any coffee.'
b'The horses are enormous, the Fiberglass designs on the central cylinder - all the clowns are knuckling and the animals turn around to look over their own shoulders - extremely finer and the climbing music portrays this on merkable'
b'The many clich\xc3\xa9s of a city ensue: The views of high buildings will be old, the skyline will be too familiar to offer much entertainment, and the reality of the city will not match the dream.'
b"It's nearly twenty-five years later, and I'm still not quite over the moon when I discovered that Swiss Cottage in fact isn't a Swiss Cottage - the theme pub Ye Olde Swiss Cottage counts not - but a big circle in the north of London."
b'It is however still a strange magnifying experience, as here two two-year-olds, a 11-year-old and two women in the 40-somethings can go on and all have a great time.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cIf I had been able to rate the Karussell, I\xe2\x80\x99d have given him the full score, but to no avail, nobody has asked.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Died in this week in a shopping mall, I was forced to evaluate my "expertise" with transactions on a scale of one to five stars before I could use my credit card.'
b'The coffee shop at the corner of my street is the same, plus the option to match the valuation with a 15 % cash - this to buy something over the counter.'
b'It leads not only to a derailment of what is supposed to be a neutral exchange, but also exerts pressure on the server to incorporate personality into a situation in which there is no need.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cThe lady in the store stood enthusiastically giggling, while I was tired of making the experience of giving her my credit card with five stars.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Ichabod Pistorius with bruising from the hospital to the hospital'
b"It's the second time the prison has been shut down for a hospital visit."
b'Died last year due to the treatment of cuts to his hands, he was sent to the hospital the previous year after a case in his cell.'
b'It was charged with murder after an appeal to the Supreme Court against a first-degree conviction.'
b"We killed Steenkamp in the early hours of Valentine's Day 2013, when he shot her more than once through a door of the toilet room in his home in Pretoria on Valentine's Day."
b'Ichabod claimed that he mistaken his girlfriend for a night owl who was hiding in the cabin.'
b'It\xe2\x80\x99s their intention to appeal this time against the six-year prison sentence of Pistorius, of which they say she\xe2\x80\x99s to be to blame.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cThe National Police said they will file an appeal at the Supreme Court of South Africa, and the appeal may be heard in this year\xe2\x80\x99s session,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.'
b'It runs the risk of increasing his sentence to 15 years if the courts succeed.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cThere is no death penalty in South Africa.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'The farmer Arnold finds a merkable egg'
b'It was the last of the Blumberger schools to send the fourth-grade students from F\xc3\xbcssens and Epstein in the summer and into the further education.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cThe Entries will go on to the Gymnasium, four on to the Real School.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Dietitian Angela Sitte greeted on Tuesday the parents and representatives of the public at the Civic Center Bistro in Epsom.'
b'The symbol for the schools was selected by the 29 students of the fourth grade under the guidance of Sophia Schumacher and Regine Meder to represent a young advisor who grows up imprisoned in the husk, then but may be released into the free world.'
b'Ich f\xc3\xbchrte the muntere Schar a musical with the theme of "The Adler\'s House on the Hill".'
b'Ich fand a merkable egg, and let it be eaten by his horses.'
b'Died of a husky dog, a small adder came out.'
b'Died, the hope of making out of him a frog was crushed, the Adler stretched out on a high hill his legs out and enfolded himself.'
b"Ich zeigted the class three and four in the performance of Yvonne Frank's H\xc3\xbchnertanz."
b'The heiress danced with the young goats, who wore cylinders to the race.'
b'Die Advocates stepped up for the integration, said school principal Angela Sitte.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99re quite different from the other kittens (Kiki),\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cbut they\xe2\x80\x99re still there.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cBut I\xe2\x80\x99ll never be like a frog,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll be like a frog.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'It behooves you to be free.'
b'We wish each fourth grade student to feel welcomed into his new school.'
b'It followed up with a thank-you to the teachers, the former school principal Michael Moore, who is always available to assist students with class disruptions, and the parents.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cThe K\xc3\xbckenzeit is now over,\xe2\x80\x9d said Klassenleader Sophia Schumacher.'
b'The teacher enrolls their students after two years of teaching only very rarely, because it was a really great time.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cEarly on,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cyou\xe2\x80\x99ve been faithful to the fourth grade.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Ich lie\xc3\x9f alle students sing a song of summer and holidays.'
b'It braved the children greatly.'
b'The new school year has already registered eight first-graders.'
b'The Bulgarians arrested for illegal camping in Greece'
b'The Bulgarians have been arrested for illegal camping in Greece, according to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, quoted by the BBC.'
b'The morning of the 1st of August, Sithonian police arrested a group of illegal zillionaires, including the two Bulgarians.'
b'The same day they were released, while currently under investigation.'
b'It was reported bTV that the Bulgarians were later released.'
b'The Greek authorities have tightened control over the free camping and placed anyone found to be staying at a place that is not intended for such purposes substantial fines on.'
b'The controls will continue throughout the season.'
b'The Ministerial said that the court may order a fine.'
b'Dashboard updates for diesel cars: What the affected drivers now need to know'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cHow exactly does the software update take place?\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cHow do Diesel drivers participate in the campaign?\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'The most important questions and answers.'
b'Ich Diesel-Gipfel have BMW, Daimler, Opel and the Volkswagen Group software updates for around 5,3 million cars.'
b'It aims to improve the fuel efficiency of cars of engines of Euro 5 and possibly Euro 6 engines.'

b'Ich, the planned software updates are voluntary.'
b'The verified updates previously apply only to the cars that have shutdown software.'
b'Die-backing has been ordered by the Kraftwerks Regulatory Commission (KWC).'
b'Die and when do customers get updates?'
b'The manufacturers have announced a rush implementation in the coming months, but have yet to give any specific date.'
b'It has withstood up to each affected individual to write a letter.'

b'Ich wonder how long will the upgrades take to complete?'
b'It\'s easier to say than to say", says Smetanin.'
b'Ich h\xc3\xa4nge from the engagement of the manufacturers as well as from political pressure.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cBut we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen, voluntary action by the carmakers hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been effective at addressing environmental concerns yet.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cHow long will the update take?\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cThe repair itself could take up to three to four hours,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.'
b'It\xe2\x80\x99s much easier to get a date than it is to get a date.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cHow do you make cars that don\xe2\x80\x99t have cars from BMW, Daimler, Opel and the Volkswagen Group?\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'The ACE advises against waiting.'
b"It's likely that foreign manufacturers would follow suit, according to Smetanin."
b"It's now a massive price drop of Euro-4 cars?"
b'The ACE belongs to that.'
b"It's just in the regions where roadblocks dwell."

b'The work makes him great fun, as he explains in the press release.'
b'Ich berichtet of a variety of challenging, but also rewarding tasks that will wait on his successor.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cBut it intrigues me that there hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been any recruitment that meets the requirement.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'The city is looking to hire an architect or engineer.'
b'Ich soll - under the terms of the regulation - have plenty of time for a work-in-progress.'

b'\xe2\x80\x9cThe damage to the locomotive and the machinery as well as the disruption of service and the costs for the railway\xe2\x80\x99s repairs could also have to be paid to the victims,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.'
b'It\'s going to be a "significant" sum, said the spokesperson.'
b'The damage was repaired on Friday afternoon, the train service on the southern line was operated without disruption.'

b'Dash of meat, milk and chocolate could help to reduce IBS (Inflammatory Disease)'
b'It\xe2\x80\x99s hard to believe that raw meat and cheese can make your digestive system feel like an Alptrain.'
b'The new study claims exactly the opposite: A diet that is rich in proteins and carbohydrates could reduce symptoms of patients with encephaloedema.'
b'It is an unfortunate condition that affects in the United States about 1,3 million and in Britain about 300,000 people each year. It causes diarrhoea and bloating, repeated or blurry diarrhoea, weight loss and extreme fatigue.'
b'Dieters normally are advised to avoid meat and dairy products to treat their symptoms, but researchers at the Washington University found that the essential amino acid tryptophan of proteins may help to develop immune cells,'
b'The leiteant researcher, Dr. Marco Colonna, explained that immune cells in the digestive tract patroxilate to ensure that pesticides that are present in food do not enter the body.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cThe cells that are capable of producing infections will be replaced by cells that stimulate the immune response and protect the body without damaging tissues,\xe2\x80\x9d said the researchers. \xe2\x80\x9cThese cells will be replaced by cells that stimulate the immune response and'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cWhen the balance is shifted too far inward, there may result in an enlarged colon.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'The experiments also found that a type of tolerant immune response is occurring in mice that carry a specific bacteria in their intracellular membranes.'
b'The bacteria requires tryptophan - one of the building blocks of proteins - to produce the appearance of the cells.'
b'Ich Colonna said: "We have a connection between a bacterial type - Lactobacillus reuteri - which is a normal part of the intestinal microbiome, and the development of a population of cells that promotes the immune response."'
b'The more tryptophan the mice had in their diet, the more they had of these immune cells".'
b'The study also suggested that the combination of L. reuteri and an anxiolytic reactive diet toleranter, less enlarged intestinal tracts may be beneficial when the same system is replicated to humans.'
b'The postdoctoral researcher Luisa Cervantes-Barragan examined a type of immune cell that promotes the Tolerantness when she found that a group of studym\xc3\xa4uves had such cells, but an other group of studym\xc3\xa4uves had the same cells, but separated'
b'It was speculated that the difference had to do with the microbiome of the mice - the community of bacteria, viruses and fungi that normally live in the digestive tract.'
b'It was DNA-sequenced and there were six bacteria types found in the mice with the immune cells, but without they were present in the mice.'
b'The mice were born in a sterile environment, so that they had a microbiome missing and they did not develop this type of immune cells, and they received the L. reactive and the immune cells developed.'
b'It was to understand how the bacteria interacted with the immune system, the researchers put L. reuteri in a flask and overwhelmed small amounts of the flask - without the bacteria - on unregenerated immune cells.'
b'The immune cells developed to become the tolerant cells.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cWhen the active component was removed from the fluid, it was used as a substitute of the Tryptophan-Metabolism, which is known as Indol-3-Milk.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cWhen the researchers measured the amount of tryptophan in the feces of mice, the number of such cells dropped by about 50 percent, but when the tryptophan levels were reduced, the number of such cells dropped by about half,\xe2\x80\x9d the researchers said'
b'The. Cervantes-Barragan explained that people have similar tolerant cells like mice, and that most of us have L. reactive cells in our intestinal tracts.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cIt is not known whether tryptophan-next-generation genes from L. reuters develop the cells in humans as well as in mice, but delays in gene expression in relation to tryptophan were found in mice with enterocolitis,\xe2\x80\x9d said'
b'It said: "The development of these cells is likely something that we want to encourage, as these cells embody inflation on the inner surface of the liver.'
b'Ichentiell can have high triglyceride levels in conjunction with L. reuteri leading to an extinction of this population."'
b'Ichoo believes that Manchester United with Nemanja Matic has signed a "gentle" player'
b'Ichoo has signed with Manchester United a "great deal" of a deal, according to Jose Mourinho, after the midfielder made his debut against Sampdoria.'

b'\xe2\x80\x9cThe decision of the White House to bring a Marine vessel to South Carolina for a major event that marked the moon landing last month, cost taxpayers according to figures of the military,\xe2\x80\x9d the TIME magazine said.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cThe blue Sikorsky VH-3D, known as Marine One, when the President is at sea, was the heart of the event on July 17th in Washington, D.C., with thirty-five American building programs,\xe2\x80\x9d the White House said.'
b'The Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and senior officials of the White House made a tour of products from all 50 states.'
b'Died in Connecticut, the Hubber was seen alongside a yacht from Maine, a fire truck from Wisconsin and a gathering truck from Mississippi.'
b'The military office of the White House requested the presence of the Hubble in a fragmented order or FRAGMENTARY ORDER, less than 36 hours before the Hubble landed on South Lawn, according to the records of the Marine Helicopter Squadron One ('
b'\xe2\x80\x9cI just wanted to make you aware of this because it\xe2\x80\x99s such a strange event with high visibility,\xe2\x80\x9d the commander of the HMS-1 said at the time of the event, referring to his colleague, the Marine commander for aircraft'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cThe news showed that the Hubris arrived at 7am on the South Lawn for the event at 15am, and so did the Raspberries,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cThe Raspberries were removed between 18:00 and 21:00 at this time.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Ich note that, if the departure from the White House would be postponed due to the restriction of service hours, a second team would be needed for the return flight.'
b'The original pilot was present during the event at the Hub, while the security staff of the unit spent most of the time on the ground at the time.'
b'It was not clear whether eventually there was a second pilot needed.'
b'The Hatch Act allows federal employees to use state property for political purposes.'
b'It appears to show that HMX-1 asked whether the event would interfere with the determination.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cOne of the questions we were asked was whether it was a violation of Hatch Act and we were informed that this was not the case,\xe2\x80\x9d said the commander.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cKlingt, as if you\xe2\x80\x99re locked out,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the commander.'
b'It was called "Made in America" by the White House as an official event and wouldn\'t have been covered by Hatch Act.'
b'It is also true that official events have political undertones.'
b'Died at the event, the President gave an apology for the reform of health care reform that was imminent in the Senate, and he promoted the efforts to eliminate the government\xe2\x80\x99s provisions.'
b'The use of the airplane, known as Marine One or Air Force One, for politically beneficial purposes is not a new phenomenon.'
b'It is your duty to use them for the trip.'
b'Their use only for a photo-op is unusual.'
b'Died in February, when the presidential plane was used during his first campaignnrallye in Melbourne, Florida, taxi drivers were paid for, and his Twitter feed is full of tweets about the use of the presidential plane by his predecessors.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cThe White House is excited about the show "Made In America" - the products from all 50 states that are made by American workers using American materials,\xe2\x80\x9d said the chief press officer of the White House, Lindsey Walters.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cMX-1\xe2\x80\x99s often conduct training exercises in the area of Washington and South Lawn,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99re trying to get the President to the White House with precision measurements.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cWhen Trump was on the G20 summit in Argentina, he led HMS-1 in the White House 58 training exercises,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.'

b'\xe2\x80\x9cAircraft units floated additional 11 hours at this time for "non-presidential units".'
b'The White House said the taxpayers did not take the burden for any of the other rebates presented on the event.'
b'The spokesperson of Sikorsky said the company was not involved in producing the Hubble on South Lawn.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cMX-1 does not have budgets for the presidential flights, and it\xe2\x80\x99s difficult to estimate the exact costs for the event.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'The hours of operation of the United States Department of Transportation for the budgetary year 2017 is the DOD-estimated value for the VH-3D is 24.800 USD per flight.'
b'Died the unit recorded the flight time of the aircraft as 30 minutes from the home base of the Marine Corps Air Facility in Quantum, Virginia.'
b'The White House argued that the actual costs for the operation of the Hub would be far below this rate.'
b'The cost for the taxpayer on the basis of estimates for the refunds is absurd, according to Walters.'
b'These estimates include personnel, maintenance and many other hidden expenses that are included in the annual budgets.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cIn a RAND study published in 2015, the allowances for DoD do not include the personal expenses, but include the expenses for fuel, maintenance and contracting.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'It was during this time that the former press officer of the White House, Sean Spicer, defended the use of the Hublot for the event.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cThe idea is to present this week things made in America,\xe2\x80\x9d said Spicer.'
b'Ich know Sikorsky and the state of Connecticut are very proud to contribute to our national security, and I assume that Hundreds, if not thousands, of people are dependent on them.'
b'Ich think like most Americans, we are all proud of the Hublot and other military equipment for which so many Americans have unfailingly worked.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cIt is naturally appropriate to highlight that.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cIt was not clear if Trump was interfering with the Hubber when he took his tour of the South Lawn for the first time,\xe2\x80\x9d he said in the driver\xe2\x80\x99s seat of a fire truck.'
b'The White House spoke to representatives of Sikorsky and talked to the media about his own fleet of corporate products.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cI know Sikorsky very well,\xe2\x80\x9d said the president, \xe2\x80\x9cbut I have three of them.\xe2\x80\x9d'

b'It would serve the ancient Catholic Church very well if M\xc3\xbcller and Ratzinger expressed deep regret over their own submissions or their previous incorrect interpretation of the events.'
b'The Vatican\'s "Osservatore Romano" however claimed that at the time of the reporting of violence at the Vatican, the media was "justifying" with "two-dimensional measures".'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cAt the time of the incidents in Regents Park, there\xe2\x80\x99s no doubt that it\xe2\x80\x99s about "scary and damaging acts" that should be punished and in future prevented; on the contrary, the "great media manipulation", according to the author,'

b'\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s unfair to apply today\xe2\x80\x99s measurements to previous generations,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, because the world has changed.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cIn the context of the reports about the miscarriages,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cthey often portrayed Papa Benedict XVI as a martyr.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Ich\xc3\xb6llig zu Unrecht, meint author and Historiker Michael Hesemann, who wrote with Ratzinger the memorial book "My Brother the Pope" (in 12 languages).'

b'\xe2\x80\x9cWhat exactly stands out in the 440-page report prepared by the Archdiocese of Regensburg with the Aufkl\xc3\xa4rung?\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'The 547 Regents were between 1945 and early 1990s "with high probability" victims of rape, 67 Doms were raped.'
b'Die Abschlussbericht hei\xc3\x9ft es zu Georg Ratzinger, der von 1964 bis 1994 in Regensburg t\xc3\xa4tig ward: "Zusammenfassend l\xc3\xa4sst sich also conclude that from Dom. R. in many cases forms of physical and psychological violence were used."'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cAt a high level of emotion, the punishment for the students was going to be even more severe.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cIn addition to numerous other accusers, many victims felt the general humanity of R. was reflected and therefore in many cases even positive memories of him were associated with them".'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cHesemann explains why the final report on the misconduct at the Regency Church was enacted his opinion,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cHesemann,\xe2\x80\x9d the 440-page report on the "acts of violence to protect guard dogs at the Regency,\xe2\x80\x9d paints a contradictory picture of Benedict XVI.'
b'Ich heb many students his "Mentality" hervorge.'
b'The other appears to be a choreographer and perfectionist, who despises being handy when a Domspatter did not deliver a top-notch performance.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cHow do you rate as his biographer this final report?\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cHesemann: If you\xe2\x80\x99re going to take the time to read the whole 440 pages long report from the beginning to the end, you\xe2\x80\x99ll have to wonder why the name George Ratzinger actually exists.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'It\xe2\x80\x99s just eight pages long and he\xe2\x80\x99ll clearly be clear of every conviction of contempt or contempt at the scheduling cases of sexual misconduct.'
b'The violence exerted at the preschool occurred outside of its effect.'
b'Ich kann ihm allenthally prejudice to learn of it too late or first and foremost to take his first and foremost observations not seriously enough.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cThe Dom Spaghetti School, on which he served, was regarded by practically all Beavers as - so whispered - "God", "History" and "brighter world."'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cBut even the vast majority of his students,\xe2\x80\x9d says Ratzinger, \xe2\x80\x9crepresent a very extensive sample of his students,\xe2\x80\x9d describing him as "warm", "beautiful", "educated", "compassionate", "competent" and "respectful", as a highly'
b"It's not a minority who complains about his perfectionism and his high emotional intelligence, which also led to whining."
b'The fact that he was not only hitting with stones and throwing the keys on the floor, but also throwing earrings and alluring boys at the hair or earrings, has he himself already admitted, to be tolerable and'
b'It must however be remembered that such pedagogical approaches were widespread in the fray during the 1960s and 1970s, at parents as well as at teachers.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cDo you also use such breeding methods?\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Ich, I think every one of us who was born before 1968 was born before 1968.'
b'Died in a welcoming school, a state school, I have seen that happen.'
b'Died with the, what is supposed to be the point of this report, including the ensuing sexual harassment and the violence exacerbated on school grounds, this is freely admitted.'
b'Ich fragte myself if it\xe2\x80\x99s not more concerned with his popularity and his role as the brother of Benedict XVI. that many media are screaming at him.'
b"The bayerians work hard to understand him, yet he's still eifrig abroad."
b'Die Wahrheit aber is: The report enriches Georg Ratzinger in every way!'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cIn the media, there was very much talk about the issue of misconduct at the Regent\xe2\x80\x99s Catholic Church,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.'
b'Died Georg Ratzinger imprisoned for any misconduct or contempt in relation to sexual assault?'
b'Ich Hesemann: Ganz deutlich yes.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cOne of 67 victims of sexual assaults claims to have been the Domicile\xe2\x80\x99s assistant.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Died once the parents were admitted.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve never talked to my dad or my mom about it,\xe2\x80\x9d said a victim sternly for the others, \xe2\x80\x9cbut it was very peevish.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cThe real problem with surveillance of sexual assault was and is yet to be that the most victims turn out to be from shame.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cIf they weren\xe2\x80\x99t raised by parents and grandparents, then quite possibly not by a choir director who was supposedly a colleague of the murderer.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'It behooves to be considered the Dom Pedro\xe2\x80\x99s role in the Missing Cases?'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cHesemann: A beaver wrote it so: \xe2\x80\x9cBecause of sexual misconduct... I... see... no case where he (Georg Ratzinger) would have had adequate information and been able to keep the individual on track.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Ich... also... consider it... really absurd to assume that his... buddy has been assertive or clearer or even more open-minded than their parents, interns, trustees etc.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cWhen you talk to him about sex... - unthinkable.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'The report concludes to the most obvious conclusion: "The fact that he did not consult him in advance affected students and/or their families, was not confirmed in the course of the investigation".'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cWhat sexual harassment involves, is Georg Ratzinger also free of any constraints,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.'
b'It can also be argued that he did not prevent or condone him to do so.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cThere is also no reason to associate his good name with these wider-ranging crimes,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cas has been the case in some cases.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cIn the media was much of the gossip about "getting pregnant" at the Regent\xe2\x80\x99s Catholic Church.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'The former Domicile George Ratzinger is quoted in the report "Weight Watch".'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cHow does he live with this belief?\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s the big problem,\xe2\x80\x9d Hesemann said, \xe2\x80\x9cthat in the reporting everything was mixed and matched to a massive mesh of sexual misconduct and violence exaggeration and somewhere, right there, George Ratzinger.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'The exact opposite is again a misrepresentation of the report.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s cleaned up clean: Between the preschool and the Gymnasium of the Doms, between sexual harassment and violence exaggerations and, say, other allegations.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Ich behandelt the report incidents from 1945 to 1945, also referring to four decades in which George Ratzinger was not Chorus leader of the Doms.'
b'Dash of the whole crappy Punkbands, the cases in which knights were schilded and maltreated and suffered entitlement, all occurred on the pre-school in Etterbeek and'
b'It had nothing to do with Domkapelmeister George Ratzinger, because he got to see the boys erst when they were already on the Domspawn gymnasium.'
b'It was, as the most prominent witnesses point out, the subject of "pre-school" tabu.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cI was just happy to see her entering and enjoying the so much better treatment and for many even "paranormal" circumstances.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b"It was different on the Dom's gymnasium?"
b'Ich Hesemann: There was zware of discipline, but just no sadistic violence.'
b'The same holds true for George Ratzinger, when the report concludes that "some of the victims reflected the general humanity of R. and therefore in many cases even positive memories with him".'
b'It remains at least the presumption of missing out.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cDespite all efforts, the report did not define two time periods when he was told of the troubles on the preschool.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Died the first time 1970/71, when he was just starting to establish himself and from the past at a school where he was supposed to act and be responsible (so the teacher) didn\xe2\x80\x99t hear anything, and then erst around 1993'
b'Died George Ratzinger before the circumstances force him to shut up the ears?'
b'The Heseman: No, because already in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the Doms, which the report even reproduces.'
b'Ichin weighed upon this, "that in the preschool, the Pledge of Allegiance will continue to be practiced".'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cAt the risk of negative press releases,\xe2\x80\x9d he emphasized, \xe2\x80\x9cwe need to act urgently.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Died naturally to a point when legal clarity was attainable, as Punkbands were also prohibited in Bayern.'
b'Ich erected them in a legal darkness, as any of us well know.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cIt was also difficult to figure out where the victims might have been overrepresented or dramatised and where really the tolerable limit was overcome,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.'
b"It can't be said he'd ever gone away."
b"It just doesn't work out that way."
b'Died in 1980, the Punkbands were banned at schools even in Bayern officially.'
b'The Gloria of Thurn and Taxis claimed that it was unfair to apply today\xe2\x80\x99s pedagogical standards to the present time.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cHow do you see that?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.'
b'It\'s Hesemann: We historians talk about the "false of the Anatomy", also the danger of treating wrongful acts after today\'s moral standards.'
b"It's the fortunes of the fortunes."
b'\xe2\x80\x9cBut that does not apply to sexual harassment, which to all intents and purposes was abhorrent and even not for what was done in the pre-school years at Widowership and violence to unarmed children,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cbut it goes far beyond that'
b"It's all quite scary and I'm glad that it's finally being tackled."
b'\xe2\x80\x9cBut simultaneously, I have to keep Georg Ratzinger in mind, because all this had nothing to do with him.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'The methods of discipline and bestiality, also earring and pulling at the hair and earring, were widespread in the 1970s.'
b'The physical torture was then prohibited, he has also strictly observed that.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cWhat kind of image of his Regency time has he taken of himself in the conversations with you for the book \xe2\x80\x9cMy Brother the Pope\xe2\x80\x9d?\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cIs the topic of plight to be brought to the forefront?\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'The Heseman: Well, in the book, it\xe2\x80\x99s about the life of his brother Joseph, also Pope Benedict XVI, told from his perspective, whereas the Doms played only a minor role.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cBut I don\xe2\x80\x99t mention that he led there a strict regime.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cBut even that must be said: Without this perfectionism, without the insistence on strict discipline, he would have been able to make from the until now rather nationally known Regents Academy a institution of world class, true cultural ambassador of Europe.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cKeeping kee and Bonbons alone makes you out to be no big singer,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cbut you\xe2\x80\x99re no big singer and will stand out, no matter on which level, but always discipline, passion and selflessness.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b'Ich was wondering what kind of person were you talking to George Ratzinger at the talks about her book?'
b'Dash Hesemann: Through the work at the book and beyond, I really really got to know George Ratzinger really well and he has always been a wonderful, humorous, fundamentally Christian, deeply spiritual and heritage rich person to whom you can\xe2\x80\x99t be none other than'
b'Ich bekomme regelm\xc3\xa4\xc3\x9fig with how many former Doms still live today, 23 years after his Emergency, keeping regular contact with him, visiting him, reading him - he is almost blind - and treating him like a member of their family.'
b'Thejengers who have refused to accept that he was once strict to them are also clearly in the minority.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cMost Doms today are grateful to him for making their lives richer and introducing them to the world of music,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cHe was always a good, gentle teacher - a strict father, yes, that may be true - but he was also a kind, respectful respectful teacher, to whom they still look today and which they are trying to honor.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b"Ich bitten' to say, again, quite clearly: What you're trying to teach him are educational methods that were at the forefront of childhood."
b'Ich k\xc3\xb6nnen froh sein, that we have overcome this time.'
b'\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s h\xc3\xb6chst unfair to make a man, just because he\xe2\x80\x99s prominent and has a more prominent brother, to be the media\xe2\x80\x99s shill.\xe2\x80\x9d'
b"It's the bad intention that's behind it all but alluded to."
b'It is the report that is being published that enlightens him.'
b'It would be the act of a 93-year-old man, who has made great contributions and without whom outside Bayern and perhaps even America would probably not have known the Regents, to finally put the Regents in peace.'
