b'All the trees through out the world can be categorized into three types.'
b'The areas where natural trees and wines deteriorates are called desserts.'
b'Eventhough there is no sufficient rain to grow forests mediterranean grasslands can be seen.'
b'Small trees, shrubs, thorny bushes and grasses can be seen in areas with less rainfall and evergreen plants are found in areas with high rainfall.'
b'Plants grow well in the rainy season while leaves fall and rest in the dry season.'
b'It is difficult to access these due to bushes growing under the hige trees.'
b'There are many shrubs such as Rosemary, Laurel & Lavender which bloom lots of flowers and spread fragrance.'
b'The plants are located distant from each other and a  special feature is that of presence of deciduous plants.'
b'Plant variety and abundance are less than tropical rain forest.'
b'The nature of the plant associations depends on various climatic features and inter-reactions of  different factors.'
b'Plant scenario ends when the plants suitable for that area is developed.'
b'Stratification is the most highlighted feature in evergreen plants in deserts.'
b'In the areas that are close to the equator, we can see bamboo trees, palm trees. tulips, Magnolia, camellia.'
b'In the temperate zone deciduous trees that leaves fall due to high cold are grown.'
b"Self-growing trees and plants that grow without man's influence is called as natural plants."
b'Next the active source is transmitted to the nearby cells.'
b'The signal then travels along the bundle of His to left and right bundle branches through to the ventricles of the heart'
b'Then oxygen is supplied to the body through systematic circulation and it will obtain carbon dioxide and relatively oxygenated blood is sent to heart to pump to the lungs.'
b'The speed of the heart pulse is increased by nerve sympathetic.'
b'These are the dynamic cells present in the conductive system of the other cell type.'
b'Intercalary system causes the cells and cells to acts as and enable contractions to pump blood into the heart, cells and the arteries.'
b'The interatrial septum separates the atria and the interventricular septum separates the ventricles.'
b'Ion delivery occurs from concentrated to non concentrated point.'
b'In the atherosclerosis condition, the arteries are narrowed due to plaque being deposited on the inner artery walls, thereby reducing the blood volume that flows in to the heart.'
b'In the upper right atrium, we can see a auricular structure called right atrial appendage'
b'Before birth, women and men have no difference between heart beating rate.'
b'One valve is located between every atrium and ventricle and ,another valve is located inside every ventricle.'
b'Those are the inner endocardium, middle myocardium and outer epicardium.'
b'Epicardium is a muscular tissue from inside and a fibrous tissue from outside.'
b'Those are epicardium, myocardium, and endocardium.'
b'It means that when the Ventricles are getting bigger, it contracts more intensively.'
b'That is the unique ability to start cardiac functional potential at a constant rate.'
b'The increase in epinephrine, norripinefrine, and thyroid hormone levels may also increase the pulsation rate'
b'This forms the atrioventricular septum which separates the atrium from the ventricles.'
b'This will allow the potassium to travel out of the cell.'
b'By that sodium and calcium tube which contain chemical or lignin substance opens.'
b'It transmits the contraction impulse rapidly from cell to cell and causes the whole heart to contract.'
b'The signal then moves to the atrium-ventricle nobe.'
b'starts to beat and pump blood at about three weeks into\xc2\xa0embryogenesis'
b'The reason for this is to withstand the the pressure during the recreation process..'
b'The reason for that is the effects on the heart muscle because of exercise.'
b'The reason for that is the requirement of  higher force to pump blood to the whole body.'
b'It reduces the frequency of long term inactive heart beats.'
b'It begins to beat in a speed close to the speed of the mother`s beating heart.'
b'Accordingly, Muscles of right and left atrium compress together.'
b'As well as the external characteristics of heart diseases like swollen legs or fluid collection inside the lungs should be determine this way.'
b'Also there is a cardiac notch at its edge to facilitate the heart.'
b'In there oxygen is entered to the blood and Carbon-dioxide is removed.'
b'The received oxygen is used at this point and metabolism breaks that into Carbon-dioxide.'
b'Its base area has been produced upwards while the end has gradually narrowed down.'
b'As a result heart beat is increased.'
b'They are delayed by inflammation through the tubules that means that the sinusoidal duct will increase their lifetime during their positive loading.'

b'Atria open to the ventricles through the atrioventricular valves.'
b'The gland which is situated in between the auricle gland is called as the aural gland.'

b'When ventricles systole, blood flows to the pulmonary artery or the greater aorta.'
b'When the ventricle relaxes , as a response to lowered pressure  the Pulmonary valve and aorta close.'
b'When the ventricle relaxes, blood will flow from artery to the ventricle.'
b'A special membrane called perkin fibers help to transmit this signal to the ventricle.'
b'The time period which takes to fill the ventricles is a main reason which affects this. '
b'The ventricles are more richly innervated by sympathetic fibers than parasympathetic fibers'
b'As the male has only a little time when the sacs are being rapidly contracted, the pre-load is small.'
b'The pressure caused by the ventricle contraction opens up the aorta and the pulmonary valves.'
b'In the wall of the right atrium is an oval-shaped depression known as the\xc2\xa0fossa ovalis'
b'Right auricle collects blood continuously from two main veins called superior & inferior Vena Cava.'

b'Now the oxygenated vascular blood moves through the veins and eventually moves towards the right heart along the veins and femur.'
b'As with all cells in the body, it is essential to provide oxygen, nutrient and remove metabolic waste from the heart tissues.'
b'This is hardly ever used at all as its specificity and sensitivity is low.'
b'But, this would affect the size of the heart, the physical and mental conditions of a person, sex, contraction time period, preload and afterload.'
b'But many other medical professionals also contribute to the treatment of heart disease.'
b'A coagulation screen is often required to ensure that the right level of anticoagulation has been given.'

b'In contrast to this Fish have two heart chambers.'
b'Consequently. the left atrium and left ventricle together is metioned as the left heart.'
b"One example of a murmur is Citil's murmur."
b'Because of this oval hole, foetal blood can directly  flow from right atrium to the left atrium'
b'Mitral valve is located separating these two chambers.'
b'The process is called depolarization, which occurs spontaneously.'
b'Conditions such as angina pectoris and heart attacks may occur due to this.'
b'This suggests that the contraction force is proportional to the initial length of the muscles'
