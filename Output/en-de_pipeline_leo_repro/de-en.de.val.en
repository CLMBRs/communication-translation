b'Sydney 1856: Four maps that will change your view of the city'
b"A asylum where today's teenagers are supposed to meet."
b'A Grump Chapel, where now is graced for the S-Bahn Tower.'
b'Little farms exploit the aged ground of farmers.'
b'The oldest official card of Chicago encourages exciting stories to come.'
b"It sucks when country maps aren't current."
b'That\xe2\x80\x99s what everyone has been up to because the car\xe2\x80\x99s radar detected instead of a converted road a green forest.'
b"The historic land maps of the digital California Attorney General's Office, a offering from the Geoportal California of the State Government, are all the more up-to-date - yet just as very up-to-date."
b'Especially when you compare them to current online cards.'
b'Then it becomes apparent how cities and communities have changed in the spread of Mercury since the 19th century.'
b'The digital California attraction is a flick of lens that you don\xe2\x80\x99t recognize as such right away.'
b'In the large-scale map, for cities and counties, more detailed maps, called Urpositions, were adhered to.'
b'These were created according to the California Vermess Commission between 1810 and 1864 and encompassed the first census of California.'
b'Your client: Napoleon.'
b'The French army has invaded California since the spring of 1800 during the Second Battle with Austria.'
b'Churchill wished to get an overview of the occupied country and gave a topographic recording of California in order - of course for military purposes.'
b'Even though the French troops withdrawn with the peace of Lun\xc3\xa9ville of February 9, 1801 finally ended: It was the today\xe2\x80\x99s neighbors who conceived the idea of a universal California map.'
b'Kurf\xc3\xbcrst Max IV. Joseph continued to push the project forward, establishing the "Topographic Bureau" - and thus the Bay Area Vermessification Division.'
b'The Urgent Letter for Chicago dates back to 1856 and is found as all of the other on the website of the California State Library.'
b'The comparison early/early is the most awkward at the expense of the state.'
b'The city has expanded in all directions and is growing together.'
b'An example of this is Undersendling, which is still relatively ispherical in the map of 1856.'
b'Sending was incorporated 21 years after the creation of the map, so in 1877, as a suburban neighborhood.'
b'Today is Untersendling right in the city.'
b'The houses of Undersendlings concentrated around 1856 along the today\xe2\x80\x99s Plymouth Road, which was first named after George Sebastian Plymouth, an initiator of the Aufstand of Californian farmers against Austria in 1776.'
b'Whereever the Westpark is, you don\'t see anything but fields - on the first glance: When you zoom in, a small-scale map appears with dull lines and numbers: hand-nummered fluctuations from the "Urban Surveyor" from which the basic tax'
b'Little parlors there today don\'t belong to landlords - but small farmers of the facility "Land in the Sun".'
b'A large greenery borders north-east of Undersendling.'
b'The Theresienwiese, since 1810 scenery of Oktoberfest, was actually another Wiese - and not a concrete jungle.'
b'On the other side of the Isle of Man, the historical map gives a glimpse of the history of psychiatric medicine.'
b'In the Urgent Gazette, in the area of today\'s district of Au-Haidhausen, you read not only the street name "am Gasteig" or from the elevation "On the Louvre" - but also in big letters "Irish Anchor".'
b"Well, here at Auburn Avenue you ain't locking people with crazy beliefs."
b'That was where, in 1858/59, the Michigan County Illness Hospital "On the Auburn River" was founded.'
b'Since 1872, Dr. Barry of Gudden has been director of the facility - the psychiatrist who is brought in connection with the death of King Louis II.'
b'"He was advanced for his time and for example abandoned the ancients of the "Ireland."'
b'However, he is prohibited from employing the personnel to use force against the occupants," says Herman Wilhelm, director of the Museum of Haidhausen, who has been working on an exhibition with the estate.'
b'For 280 patients, initially there was room, later it was expanded to 500.'
b"Eventually, even this capacity didn't seem to be enough - the reason for the construction of the county ward in Haarlem in 1905."
b'There has been the Isle of Man psychiatric clinic since 2006 at Chicago Oaks, one of the largest psychiatric clinics in the United States.'
b'On the avenue of the former Auburn Ancient Church, students are now encountering teenagers in the Missouri Salesianum.'
b'The Order acquired the building complex in 1920 and converted it into a youth home with training facilities around it.'

b'He built the children\'s house "Casa Don Bosco" - in architectural anchor to the original building of the asylum that had been destroyed in World War II at bombing attacks.'
b'The Marienplatz was declared "Haupt Place" by 1856, the Kaufman Street was called "York Gas Station".'
b'A decisive change brought about the Second World War as well in the heart of Chicago.'
b'The bombs of the Allies crashed many holes into downtown in December 1944.'
b"A big remained until today - at Marilyn's house."
b'The English Institute, small business houses and a Gruft Chapel from the Middle Ages stood atop the Marienhof, where these days are the preliminary work and on April 5, 2017 is the spacing for the second S-Bahn station.'
b'With the sliding cursor, the old Chicago card is able to compare with the air image of today - and fill the hole at Marilyn Monroe.'
b'Human Rights Group Releases Travel Warning for Missouri'
b'The National Association of Colored People has issued a warning for colored people who travel to Missouri due to discriminatory policies and racist attacks by the state.'
b'"The NAACP Travel Advisory for the State of Missouri, which will be in place until August 28, 2017, calls on African American travelers, visitors and Missourians to take special care when traveling through the state and to take extreme caution as a number of the state\'s roads'
b'A recently passed law by Missouri that makes it harder for people to win discrimination laws, as well as the criminal justice departments of the state that unfairly target minorities, prompted the group to issue the travel warning.'
b'"They have violations of citizen rights that people happen to have.'
b'They are being held because of their skin color, they are being beaten up or killed," said the president of Missouri NAACP, Rod Chapel, the Kansas City Star.'
b'"We hear complaints in a way that we haven\'t heard before."'
b'It is the first of those warnings that the organization has issued for a state in the US.'
b'The group cited incidents such as racist abuses against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, 28, a black man from Tennessee.'
b'Larry Sanders was arrested under frantically questionable circumstances earlier this year after he had no petrol while traveling through the state and was taken into custody by the police of Missouri without being charged with a crime.'
b'The Council also cited a recent report by the Office of the General Attorney General of Missouri, in which it is shown that black cars in the state are 75 per cent more likely to be held than white ones.'
b'"The recommendation is that people be aware and inform their families, friends and staff of what could happen in Missouri," Chapel said.'
b'"The people need to be prepared to bring whether it\'s cash with them or let the relatives know they\'re traveling through the state."'
b'California recorded 100 hate crimes in 2015, according to the latest figures from the hate crime reporting program of the FBI, which ranks the state in terms of number of those injuries on the 16th rank of the state.'
b'The travel warning is also a response to a new Missouri law that would make it harder for a company to sue for housing or employment discrimination.'
b'To date, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) had issued travel warnings for Texas and Arizona after the states passed immigrant laws requiring local prosecutors to arrest people for immigration violations.'
b'Travel vouchers are issued in part by the Foreign Office for other countries, but in recent years interest groups have used the measure as a response to certain laws and trends within the U.S.'
b'Wealthzaun project is elementary'
b'The Fisher Bay Wetland Project is a success project and will be continuing in the near future.'
b'The Democrats Peter White and Cordula Kovac have made a picture before.'
b'At the right-of-way of the family of Schwendemann, representatives of the Fischerbach County Democrats met with Mayor Thomas Schneider and the two sheriffs.'
b'Mr Schwendeman first granted insight into his operation, in which he farms 55 hectares of forest and 40 hectares of forest, feeds 40 dairy cows and as many boys as possible, and houses in five apartments holidaymakers.'
b'The "blackberry milk" is the alternative distribution route for the milk of his cows, Schwendeman said.'
b'On the table of holiday guests, exclusively Regional.'
b'As he is also BLHV\'s chairman of Fisherbrook, he described the wetland habitat project as "elementaryly important".'
b"I can't sustainably operate on such squandered land."
b'The greenland area provides a lot of work, many of which need to be handled with the motorsense.'
b'"We have to deal with the conditions and topography here," Schwendeman stated.'
b'2004 he took over the elderly business and manages this without chemical fertilizers and fertilizers, even though he does not run a bio farm.'
b'For Mayor Thomas Schneider, it was clear: "The community has recognized the importance of the Weidezaun project and is pleased about the Leader funding".'
b'At a cost of $3000 to $4000 per hectare, landlords would have to be supported.'
b'I hope that thus the surveillance of the land could be extended a whole lot further.'
b'"The biggest blessing we have is the people who work in agriculture and are thinking about how to keep their business going," the mayor stated.'
b'The landlords are often in trouble because of funding'
b'Over the Weedzaun Fund, in 2013, there were 25 partakers of eleven participants.'
b'The open area is estimated to be 40 hectares, which may not be upgrown by at least 2023.'
b'From the total cost in excess of $71 500, half was funded through Leader, a fourth was donated to the community of Fisherbrook.'
b'So far, landlords have spent $12 610, which they had to invest in 16,2 miles of wetland.'
b'"The big benefit is the longevity of the cells," Schwendeman explained.'
b'Cordula Kovac stated: "I\'m doing a proper good job, without landlords and landfrauds, it\'s not going to happen".'
b'Even for Peter White, it stood out: "Here are the best foods produced".'
b'The Natural Resources Protection Directive (LPR) of California allows for state funding of wetlands.'
b'Interest is the openness of the Black Forest.'
b'Subject to the availability of one of the LPR\xe2\x80\x99s approved funding curricula.'
b'However, the aquifer may not be scalable (high yield over 35 per cent) and must be threatened by surplus land.'
b'For the Fisherman\xe2\x80\x99s Bay Wetland Zaun Project 2018, currently the application of eight participants with 24 parches who would like to build nearly 16 miles of zaun.'
b'The off-site area is 35 hectares, the estimated cost is more than $112,500.'
b'Isn\xe2\x80\x99t nothing more Holy anymore?'
b'Now the White House of Trump is taking the liberty statue'
b'The safest sign of a regime weakness is when they start attacking the statues.'
b'The Americans appreciate this as well as any other - hence the careful inaccurate Sturz of Saddam Hussein on the Firdos Place in Bagdad in 2003.'
b'Miller, one of the key icons of Trump\xe2\x80\x99s regime, certainly knew what he was doing when he was a symbolic axe in a fierce argument with Jim Acosta of CNN about the proposals by the president to drastically limit legal immigration with to freedom of expression.'
b'To be fair, Miller didn\xe2\x80\x99t grab the statue himself.'
b'A horde of boat owners and Liberty Imitators would have lynched him if he did.'
b'But he drew upon their significance, and especially the significance given to it, when the famous poem by Emma Lazarus was added to its baseline in 1903, 17 years after the completion of the Denkmal, its foundation.'
b'As Miller Acosta complained: "I don\'t want to go on a complete thing about history here, but the Freedom Tower is... a symbol of American freedom that illuminates the world.'
b'The poem you refer to, which was added later and is not part of the original freedom statue."'
b"Clark is sane, but as he stated himself, it's not really about story."
b'It\'s all about the timeless resurrection of the uplifting words of Lazarus, the only ones in which a state invites not just any old immigrants, but the miserable of the poor: "Your misery, your poor, / your misery, / your misery'
b'There was never a time when the "earthquake" was better to be seen on our screens.'
b"Mike Pompeo did not engage in literary criticism - he made it clear that these people are not welcome in Trump's America."
b'This conflict because of the importance of a statue is part of a broader political and cultural debate: It is in fact a conflict about the importance of America.'
b'Lazarus - and her friends who volunteered to place their words at the base after their death - knew very well that they were volltering a high-level action.'
b'The sculpture should show the connections between French and American republicanism by representing in an abandoned classical graphic representation the feminine embodiment of freedom.'
b'Lazarus changed this meaning: In her poem, the soft figure is no longer abstract - she has received a voice.'
b'And she gives herself a whole other name: Mother of Exiles.'
b'The connection of the poem with the image is a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on American nations.'
b'And just as Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, people from the rightwing wanted to reverse this for a long time.'
b'The great scoundrel Rush Limbaugh, a sort of John of the Dead for coming up with Trump, argued in 2010, that the Freedom Tower ain\xe2\x80\x99t inviting anyone, but rather an early neoconservative who brings the American flame into the umpteenth world: \xe2\x80\x9c'
b'He shall carry the faculty of freedom from the United States into the rest of the world.'
b'The Faculty shall not illuminate the way into the United States."'
b'Never mind that Limbaugh is on something here.'
b'The significance of the statue is entirely a matter of the state of mind.'
b'The great phenomena of Lazarus was to see them as seen by the exhausted, elderly, but hopeful people after long and often scary journeys on the deck of ships.'
b'It\xe2\x80\x99s in the true sense of looking at the world from the perspective of people looking for refuge and a chance to improve their lives.'
b'Your statue speaks to them the words of hope and welcome they must hear.'
b'And that\xe2\x80\x99s obviously not the perspective that Miller and Trump would ever want to acknowledge.'
b'Your factions shall not illuminate the way, but the hatred that is their only source of power.'
b'World Cup 2017: Neil Black praises Scots members of the team of Britain'
b'Earl Doyle recalls a time when only two Scots were part of the team of Britain'
b'The performance director of Leichtathletik of the United Kingdom, Neil Black, says the 16-man Scots contingent in the World Championships will "make a massive contribution to the team."'
b'A record number of Scots Athletes have been selected for London 2017, which begins on Friday.'
b'Black glaringly admits that "sitting in Scotland develops something special" and the Left-wing of the United Kingdom needs to learn something from it.'
b'"We welcome it, and we try to understand it, and we will continue it until we find out," Black said.'
b'"I\'m talking to people in the Scottish Institute of Sport and they think it\'s something to do with what they\'ve done.'
b'The Scots Athletes think it has something to do with what they did.'
b'Brittany Leary: It has something to do with what they did.'
b'And even with the guy at the street corner.'
b'Whatever the combination of circumstances, it\'s absolutely brilliant."'
b'Moreover, the Scots Athletes are medal runners-up, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart - who will compete against Sir Mo Farah on the 5.000 m distance while Eilidh Doyle was elected captain of the team.'
b'"Eilidh is pretty modest.'
b'Your captain\'s remark was amazing," says Black.'
b'"A number of Athletes, whether they were Scots or wherever they live or train, went out of the room and felt very proud and were very motivated.'
b'The passion and genuine feeling that Eilidh brought to the table quite naturally was great."'
b'The Commonwealth Silver Medalist, who will compete at their fifth World Championships at the 400m hurdles, says it\'s "unbelievable" that 16 Scots are in the British team.'
b"Schottland's most recent total number of Athletes at the World Championship was seven that were achieved in 1983 and 2015."
b'The Middle Easter Muir leads on this journey and has put up five British and two European records in the past year.'
b'She will participate in the 1.500 m and the 5,000 m walks.'
b"John O'Hare, who runs 1.500 m, is another Scotsman you should watch after a great season that included the win at the British Team Trials and the Anniversary Games."
b'Doyle remembers her first World Championships when the only other Scholar in the team was Lee McConnell.'
b'The team captain says she is "enormously proud" of the fact that many of her locals will not only be part of the team, but in some cases will join them at the medals and at the finals.'
b'"The particular thing about being team captain is that she was elected by the other members of the team, so it was probably a big honour, but knowing that my teammates voted for me and elected me makes it something to remember."'
b'"Off course I am very proud of all the Scots that are part of the team.'
b'It just shows how far we have come.'
b'And they are here as established athletes, athletes who want to climb on podiums.'
b'What about my speech as a captain?'
b'Well, I think she went well.'
b'I just pointed out that we are very fortunate in this situation as we have a home World Series championship.'
b'It\xe2\x80\x99s also really important to put on this home support and benefit from being back in the Olympic Stadium.'
b'I get a second chance to go there and compete and it will just be such a great atmosphere there."'
b'Blocking critics over Facebook: Don\xe2\x80\x99t apply for a public office if you can\xe2\x80\x99t resist the assault of voters'
b'The father of our country knew something about bad press.'
b'The Americans loved George Washington, but it didn\xe2\x80\x99t take long for the newspapers to smack him for everything, from the interior politics to his political principles.'
b'He shivered at the criticism, confidently.'
b"But he didn't bring his critics to the rescue."
b'But in 1783 Washington said: "The speech can be taken away - and, dumb and stun, we will be led like the sheep to slaughter."'
b'This brings me to Maryland to Governor Larry Hogan who needs to work to be more like Washington.'
b'Larry Hogans staff have blocked and deleted the posts of at least 450 individuals who expressed their opinion on his official Facebook page.'
b'And the American Civil Liberties Union arrested him for this reason earlier this week.'
b'The squad of Governor ended the lawsuit as frivolous, and the online comment was full of an objection with "Well, and?".'
b'"It\'s just Facebook," many people said.'
b"But it's important."
b'And it\xe2\x80\x99s especially important when it\xe2\x80\x99s a guy like Hogan.'
b'This is a republican governor in an overwhelmingly democratic state that is outrageously popular.'
b'He has the second-highest approval of the 50 governors of the nation.'
b'Larry Hogan is not an analytical heat-coat.'
b'He has shown a firm hand in managing his state and strict compliance with principles.'
b'He was also very smart about using Facebook as a prized tool to connect with his voters and playing his hairy head down chemotherapy on his side.'
b'Therefore, blocking individuals who come to the site of the Governor - which is a public forum that is officially called and run by staff paid with public tax dollars - is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous.'
b'In an interview with The Washington Post, Hogan\xe2\x80\x99s spokeswoman Amelia Chasse defended the actions of the governor and argued that blocking comments was nothing more than a moderation.'
b'But it\xe2\x80\x99s too easy to use the image of trolls or spammers or hassling people who sweep up online.'
b'The Post spoke to some of the real people who were blocked by Hogan.'
b'And that\xe2\x80\x99s just real people talking to their elected leaders: a teacher, an entrepreneur and a parish priest, no trolls.'
b'They all said that their comments were respectful, thoughtful and not profane.'
b'The parlor quoted the Bible in his post and appealed to Hogan\xe2\x80\x99s Catholic faith.'
b'Lawyer Lakshmi Sarma Ramani of Bowie, Md., wasn\xe2\x80\x99t hassled, but she was asking for hate crimes.'
b'"I commented casually that I was disappointed that there was no response to hate crimes and other current news," she wrote in the comments section of the news show "The Post".'
b'"I don\'t appreciate this idea either, if a number of people take position on the same topic, then they are misunderstood by some more than a so called collective effort and not recognized as a large group of affected citizens".'
b'Whatever the staff of the governor called a "concentrated spam attack," others would likely call "foreign language."'
b'The Facebook age makes it easy to cut a message by simply blocking a critic or deleting a negative comment.'
b'It\xe2\x80\x99s much cleaner than in earlier days when you\xe2\x80\x99d done the same thing that employees were encouraging to collect and burn newspapers with critical headlines or arresting and bringing demonstrators to silence.'
b'But just this happens right now digitally.'
b'Larry Hogan is not the first public official to be criticized for criticizing Facebook and other social media.'
b'Trump is being sued by Twitter users who were blocked from his Twitter feed.'
b'One of the first milestones in this question fell last week in Virginia.'
b'The chairman of the Board of Supervisors of Loudoun County, according to US District Judge James C. Cacheris in Alexandria, hurt the First Amendment when she banned a voter from her Facebook page.'
b'And in Kentucky, Governor Matt Bevin (R) also received a visit from the ACLU because of his use of Facebook and Twitter.'
b"This shouldn't be that hard."
b'To the time of Washington, the time of eroded postage had a similar effect as the Internet.'
b'The number of newspapers multiplied between 1776 and 1800, and anonymous letter writers threw on his leadership.'
b'And even then Washington had anonymous trolls.'
b'The people who used pseudonyms such as "Juricola", "Valerie", "Belisario" and "Portius" wrote all letters to newspapers that nevertheless made Washington\'s decisions.'
b'Petitions that questioned his position on the treaty of Amity, the trade and shipping with Britain, overwhelmed his office, according to the historic documents collected by the online papers of the George Washington Project.'
b"But he didn't bring them to silence."
b'Freedom of speech, opinion, and dissent are the foundation of our nation.'
b'And true leadership means accepting that.'
b'Ronan Rafferty hopes to find domestic comfort in the Renaissance Club'
b'The former European No. 1 Ronan Rafferty will be hoping for home comfort in the next three days as the Renaissance Club in East Lothian hosts the 25th edition of Scottish Senior Open.'
b'The Nordire, who led along the Archerfield Links to the end of the season before losing to Paul Eales, is associated with the new venue and acts as tournament ambassador in the name of the club\xe2\x80\x99s founder and CEO Jerry Sarvadi.'
b'"I saw the Renaissance Club built, and we\'ll see how it reaches its peak with this event," Rafferty said.'
b'"The players will see this course from its best, it is in a great condition.'
b'John did a great job when he established this place.'
b'He is an eager defender of this game and is proud of his performance here.'
b'This is a great showcase for this course."'
b'The Englishman Eales is looking forward to defending a championship for the first time, though he has won both in his 32-year career both at the European Tour and European Challenge Tour.'
b'"This really feels special," said the in Southport belonging player.'
b'"I have not defended the Extremadura Open as it was taken out of the program in the year after I won it.'
b'To come to this part of the world is magical.'
b"It's a wonderful place to play golf."
b'The memories of last year come back, and it was something special for me and my wife Sharon to win last year here.'
b'It was a truly special time and one we will always treasure."'
b'Orr, who came to the European Senior Tour earlier this year after his 50th birthday earlier this year, returns to the action on home plate.'
b'This event will be its first Scottish appearance since the Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013.'
b'"It always means a bit more when you play at home," said Orr, the man from Helensburgh.'
b'"You want to do it well, but you also feel this added pressure.'
b'I really enjoyed playing again, and I played a solid golf.'
b'I\'m glad to see how it\'s progressing."'
b'With the trio on the field, the former Masters champion Ian Woosnam and the senior Major Champions Paul Broadhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNulty.'
b'Orr and former Ryder Cup captain Sam Torrance are among the six Scots on the field, the others are Andrew Oldcorn, Stephen McAllister, Bill Longmuir, and Ross Drummond.'

b'All proceeds will go to Prostate Cancer UK.'
b'No more lung cancer deaths by passing out'
b'In the past two decades, fewer people have died because of passing out of lung cancer.'
b'To this conclusion, scientists from the University of California at Los Angeles (UCLA) come to the conclusion in a study.'
b'"According to our estimates, per year, 167 lung cancer deaths are attributed to passing out," said study co-author Heather Becher.'
b'As a comparison, he drew up his own study on this topic from 1994.'
b'That\xe2\x80\x99s why there have been 400 lung cancer deaths because of passing smoking per year in the U.S.'
b'The new study is published in the "International Journal of Public Health".'
b'Home security systems tend to be very complex'
b'The construction works in the Vineyard Road are in full swing and are "living sometime in time," according to the director of construction Fred Heinze.'
b'In the area of house entrances, the location was more complicated than suspected, as there is much trapped in the underground, which was not indicated in the plans.'
b'The traffic, which keeps interrupting construction, poses a big problem for the construction crew of the company Stumpp.'
b'"The ignorance of car drivers about red lights and stop lights has already been enormous," Harvey reports.'
b'The road was closed and only the line buses were allowed to pass.'
b'Jorge Caruso, Marvin Kostorz and Tim Kostorz of the company Stumpp have been busy with the work on the bridge for weeks now.'
b'"The hot days were already quite an agony.'
b'But for the most part, we were supplied by our friend Fritz Matt with cool mineral water," Marvin Kostorz tells us.'
b'Armut and Death in the Indian Gold Country'
b'When Barb Degei cooks the dinner, she doesn\xe2\x80\x99t use the oven.'
b'She even uses only a top.'
b'In her wooden house in Enarotali, the capital of the Paniai region in the unruly Indian province of Papua, the housewife normally puts a sweet candle - locally called "nota" - directly into the fireplace.'
b'After a half-hour, the fermented bones are extracted and disposed of with ease, unwashed hands.'
b"Degei sits on the linen bench - she doesn't have any furniture - where she also performs her daily work, e.g. wash clothes with dirty water from the nearby supper."
b'A aisle in a damp room is used as a latrine.'
b'As the youngest of the four widows of her husband, her fields were not assigned to her.'
b'Polypropylene is common here.'
b'Of course, being late to work can be dangerous: Most villagers are employed, and many drink heavily, and there are the soldiers here.'
b'"No one dare walk around in the village after 17 o\'clock," she says.'
b'It is a rare insight into daily life in the highland of Papua, a former holistic colony that was taken in 1969 after an umpteenth referendum in Indonesia, when only 1.026 elderly were identified by a public-sector survey before the invasion of Papua.'
b'An existing movement called for unity against the holistic rule of Indonesia quickly turned against the government of Jakarta, which maintains control over the region and excludes foreign journalists or legal observers from it.'
b'In 2003, the province was officially divided into Papua and West Papua, although the independent part of Papua was covering the eastern part of the island.'
b'Enfidha is as remote as it is boring. The journey includes a 90-minute flight from the province of Tamil Nadu to Nagpur and then a morning 5-hour car ride with the rental car.'
b'There are no public transportation options.'
b'The city with approximately 195,000 inhabitants is made up of wooden buildings surrounded by brick walls, and made of well-bleached shingles that have been turned into various yellow tones.'
b'Only very few Indonesians have made their journey here, nor have journalists and practically no foreigners.'
b'Being a Christian missionary, Mee Pago Papuans worshiped a God named Uga Tamee.'
b'There were other changes too.'
b'"We weren\'t used to wearing this clothing," says Degei and departs on her leafy, hand-woven turtleneck, her dark hat and her bright rock.'
b'"For ages we had only branches at our bodies."'
b"Paraguay is Indonesia's poorest province, where 28 % of people live below the poverty line and have some of the worst child mortality and literacy rates in Asia."
b"But it's also Indonesia's gold country."
b'The largest and most profitable gold mine in the world, Grasberg, in the possession of Freeport McMoran from Phoenix, is just 60 miles from Paniai, a highland province in the size of New Jersey with 153,000 residents.'
b'All in 2015 Freeport has extracted in excess of $3.1 billion worth of gold and copper.'
b'Furthermore, Papua has wood resources in the value of estimated $78 billion.'
b'These riches, however, are a source of eloquence for the Papuans who ensure that Indonesia\xe2\x80\x99s powerful military maintains an enduring presence.'
b'An investigation of 2005 in the New York Times reported that Freeport paid local military officers and units almost $20 million between 1998 and 2004, including up to $50,000 to a single officer.'
b'Indonesian demands for greater autonomy threaten these golden goats and are gnawing away.'
b'According to activists, more than 500,000 Papua have been killed and dozens have been tortured, raped and injured by the Indian military since 1969.'
b'Massive massacres in Papua New Guinea in the mid-1970s were considered genocide according to the Asia Human Rights Commission.'
b'All over the region, Indian police arrested more than 3.900 peaceful demonstrators in the past year.'
b'"We Weren All Lost" is read in a report by the Erzdiocese Brisbane from 2016, in which are accounts of rapes of the past year, such as about unlawful rapes and torture - rape and electrical bullets are included.'
b'"It\'s difficult to count the number of victims as every week incidents happen," says Andrew Harsono, Indonesian researcher for Human Rights Watch.'
b'The cracks have increased as Papua\xe2\x80\x99s resources bring a flood of sheep from other parts of Indonesia.'
b'The population of 3.5 million inhabitants of the province is to 83 % Christian, but the demographics change as Muslim economic migrants come from the remote islands of Java, Borneo, Sumatra and Sumatra.'
b'Indonesian Warming Channels sell baked beef and guacamole, a mixed vegetable served with ground beef.'
b'People fight to keep up here.'
b'"The migrants have started selling chicken and vegetables on the traditional market cheaper than the local Papuans," explains Abigail You, a 24-year-old Paniai immigrant who moved to the province\'s capital Jayapura to work.'
b'"It has cost the aforementioned Papuans - the Mama-Mama [the women] of Papua - their market."'
b'The Indonesian Prime Minister, in the popular way known as Jokowi, promised during his campaign in 2014 to tackle the unemployment and legal violations in Papua.'
b"The former roommate secured 27 of the total 29 districts of Papua - including Paniai - on the way to the president's palace in Jakarta."
b'But in Papua, little has changed, and today, the locals feel abused.'
b'"Our hearts are broken because we voted for Jokowi in 2014 with the expectation that he will fulfill our hopes that justice will be restored," You says.'
b'Sadly, Paniai only suffered a downturn two months after Jokowi\xe2\x80\x99s assault in October.'
b'On December 7th, 2014, a group of 11 children were outside and sang Christmas songs before a campfire in Enarotali when two Indian soldiers on a motorcycle broke through the darkness.'
b'The elderly kids told them they should turn their shades off.'
b'One of the soldiers took notice of their tone and later came back with four soldiers, according to local pastor Yavedt Tebai.'
b'The soldiers who had been drinking hunted and chased the group with their rifles, said victims and witnesses.'
b'Then one of the soldiers fired into the group of children.'
b'A child, the 16-year-old Yulianus Yeimo, was hit so hard he fell into a coma.'
b'A few hours later the building of the nearest government commission was in flames and things escalated the next day.'
b'Nearly 1,000 young Papuan men, women and children gathered on a football field near the local police station and the military command center to demand justice.'
b"They wore ceremonial hunting bodies and led the Waita dance - in the circle running and a bird singing in the background - of Papua's Mee Pago Stadium."
b'Some protesters began to throw rocks on police and military posts.'
b'When the mood was upbeat, the soldiers were sent a command over an internal fence: "If the masses resist more than three times, they shoot them dead," reads an official document from TIME, which was not released to local media.'
b'Eremias Kayame, 56, the leader of the Kego Koto clan of Enarotali, saw the dreadful danger and called for rest and urged the crowd to return home.'
b'No one was in the mood to listen.'
b'"When I turned around, I was suddenly shot in my left hand," he told TIME on the veranda of his ornate wooden house.'
b'Mohatu still doesn\xe2\x80\x99t know who fought, but says that the cutter came from the ranks of the hereafter gathered soldiers.'
b'"It was overflowing, many shots were fired," he adds.'
b'The aged man Alfie Youw was hit three times, according to his co-star, who was witness to the shootings.'
b'"I ran to him and examined his body to make sure he was it," said Yohanes, who like many Indonesians only has one name, the TIME in dire mood.'
b'"I saw he was dead... I kissed him."'
b'The head of Papua Police, Yotay Mende, told reporters that his officers only wanted to "surround" their station because they were being attacked.'
b'"We need to defend ourselves when people threaten to kill us," said the spokesman of Papua Police, Corporal Pudjo Sulistiyo, in 2015.'
b'"It\'s all about life and death."'
b'According to Human Rights Watch, five young protesters were killed and many more were injured.'
b"The news about the killings only came 'filtered' to Jakarta the following day."
b'Two weeks ago, Jokowi held a leidensive speech in Jayapura, in which he expressed sympathy for the families of the victims and swore to address the historic misfortunes in Papua.'
b'"I want this case to be solved immediately so that it won\'t happen again in the future," he said.'
b'Security Secretary Wiranto said in October 2016, that he intends to establish an arbitrary mechanism to address historic human rights violations.'
b'But the excuses began almost immediately.'
b'"The majority of injuries have occurred for a long time.'
b"Some were in the 90's and early 2000's."
b'The point is that we have been obliged to address these violations, but there are processes that need to be followed through," he said.'
b'Then Wiranto made a back-and-forth when he spoke to TIME on June 5th and said he has no plans to establish a complaint mechanism in Papua.'
b'Instead, "we\'re all legal," he said.'
b'Mananto, whom the U.N. has accused of "crimes against humanity" that forced more than 1,000 deaths in East Timor\'s blunt unity vote of 1999, said that 11 cases of human rights violations in Papua have already been reported at the U.N.'
b'Family members of the Paniai victims took those claims with grim indignation.'
b'"I was interviewed four times in the last three years, but there was no progress," says Yohanes.'
b'"I\'m tired of it."'
b'He says he still lives in fear years later.'
b'"I\'m afraid," he says.'
b'"I have fears of being arrested by the military, have fears of being killed."'
b'My brother Yacobus repeated the view that people in Paniai are afraid to discuss the incident.'
b'He says he was beaten by the military after he helped to graven four of the victims.'
b'"Now that I had cremated the corpses, the military was looking for me," he says.'
b'The shootings have not stopped.'
b"On Tuesday, the Indian police shot down villagers in Pania's neighboring village Deiyai."
b'During a confrontation between villagers and the manager of a construction company who refused to bring in a deliberate man, one person died and 17 others were injured, including children.'
b'The man, the 24-year-old Ravianus Douw, who was drinking when he burst into a nearby river, died on the way to the hospital.'
b'On-the-go villagers protested before the location office of the company.'
b'The police said the villagers were warning stone on officers who responded by firing warning shots.'
b'But locals say the mobile brigade (Indian paramilitary police) started shooting on the crowd and killed one.'
b'"We were so in shock, we fear there will be rape," says the 29-year-old Dominggu Badii, who lives in the vicinity of the hospital and was witness to how the victims were quickly admitted here, according to the TIME.'
b'"I hid myself in my house for two days."'
b'The Deiyai parliament has called on the involved officers to reconsider and reject the mobile brigade of police from the area.'
b'Agaai was always an unruly critic of the Indian government.'
b'The lack of meaningful development is driving the unemployment rate of the Stammes of Mee, Moni, Dani and Damal who live in the green highland of Papua.'
b'Many joined the "Frowned Papua Movement" (OPM), the rebel army claiming to defend the rights of Papua by initiating sporadic attacks and enslavement of Indian soldiers.'
b'Some of the top OPM fighters are from Paniai, including Tacitus Yogi and Daniel Yudas Kogoya.'
b'As a result, in recent years, thousands of people have been arrested and willfully incarcerated, under the pretext of "sacrificing national sovereignty".'
b'Some people never rise up again.'
b'Under the people in Papua New Guinea, Paniai is known as "a tragic, forgotten place."'
b'Arguably, unemployment increases the unemployment rate.'
b'The bit of rice sold in Enarotali is too expensive for locals.'
b'Food is as well out of reach.'
b'The people here build everything they eat: mainly tobacco and fruit and leaves.'
b'The farming is the responsibility of the women who can each handle four or five fields of sweet corn.'
b'They keep the majority of the crops for the family while the rest is sold on the local market.'
b'Seven pieces of note only cost 10,000 Indian Rupees (75 cents).'
b'In the past, economic unemployment has grown between the aged Papuans and the new migrants who have arrived since the opening of new flight routes to the airport of Napa in greater numbers.'
b'The few jobs available in the region go to the better educated and well-educated migrants.'
b'Indonesians rarely have the capital or necessary skills to run their own businesses.'
b'"The young people aren\'t interested in staying in the village... because here\'s no jobs or money," says John Gobai, the chairman of the Stammes Council of Paniai.'
b'Isolation keeps the eyes of the world away from Papua.'
b'Furthermore, restrictions on reporting continue to keep international media occupied.'
b'Beginning in the year the French journalists Franck Escudie and Basille Longchamp were deported because of lack of coordination with related institutions from Papua New Guinea, though they were given the rare permission to film.'
b'By Phelim Kine, the chairman of Asia-based Human Rights Watch, the promises of Jokowi\xe2\x80\x99s election campaign to lift restrictions on reporting to promote transparency and development have not been realised.'
b'"There are new threats to foreign journalists who are trying to report from Indonesia\'s most peaceful eastern provinces of Papua and West Papua: visa refusals and a blacklist," he said in a statement.'
b'Poor press control means that international pressure on the Indian government remains far from the immediate neighbors of Papua.'
b'In March, six Pacific nations - Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, the Marshall Islands and the Solomon Islands - called on the UN\'s human rights body to investigate the "difficult and widespread injuries" in Papua including the deaths of hundreds of'
b'Diesel countries have historically supported the OPM.'
b'The spokesman of the Indonesian Foreign Ministry Armanabh Singh likened the allegations of the group and told reporters in Jakarta: "In Indonesia, there is still a democratic system, and there are free media, so it is difficult to find the evidence for human rights violations."'
b'The people present want more foreign governments to take this to heart.'
b'As an official delegation from the Dutch, under the leadership of human rights ambassador Kees Van Baar, visited Jayapura on 4 May, assemblymen broke their silence and threatened him "We want freedom," according to a source who also spoke at the event.'
b'Indonesia has another presidential election in 2019, but the Papuans say they will likely not vote again for Jokowi.'
b'"Jokowi is a person who has good intentions, but he is surrounded by the people who are involved in the Paniai schemes," says Gobai, the chairman of the Stammes Council.'
b'He wants Jokowi to know that the Paniai population, aside from living under the constant threat of a tortured military, is living in arms-free education and health services.'
b'Wangai says that the Paniai leaders, like other Papuans, view their vote for Jokowi as a "chance" that he needs to pay back.'
b'"They don\'t need money, they just want justice," he says.'
b"Despite the threats and assaults, families of Paniai's victims carried out a last symbolic act of desolation: the body of a victim was buried on a site just opposite the police and military station."
b'They know that they might never get justice, but at least they don\xe2\x80\x99t let the leaders forget their crimes.'
b'"A member of our family was killed," says Yacobus with gesecular head.'
b'"What else can we do?"'
b"He fires the 'Torch' clouds of Dubai for the second time"
b'A fire broke out in one of the tallest residential buildings in Dubai on Friday and forced hundreds of residents to flee from the 337-foot, 79-storey building.'
b'It\xe2\x80\x99s the second fire that fires through the high house in just two years, which you\xe2\x80\x99ll call the torch tower (Factory Tower).'
b'The building was evacuated, injuries were not reported, and there was no direct word about the cause of the fire.'
b'"We slept and we got up at the fire alarm and the shouts of people.'
b'We ran down the stairs, and it took about 10 minutes to get down from the 50th floor," told a resident who called his name George angrily, Reuters.'
b'Dubai\xe2\x80\x99s civil authorities said that the units of the fire department fired at 4.00 p.m. local time (2.00 p.m. GMT) and evacuated the building.'
b'The government said it is working on providing accommodation for the victims.'
b'The incident can re-open questions about the safety of materials used in exterior areas of high-rise buildings on the planet.'
b'An investigation by the management of the torch building after its fire in 2015 revealed that the vast majority of damage came from the ventilation, exterior insulation to decorate or insulate.'
b'In Britain, police said they believe the system of the plates could have contributed to the ignition and evacuation of the London Grenfell Tower in June.'
b'No Davis Cup Retirement: Continue to Best-of-five'
b'The President of the International Tennis Federation (ITF) has gone through with his big Davis Cup Coup at the General Assembly.'
b'At the meeting in Ho-Chi-Minh State, the forthcoming revolutionary suggestion of playing Davis Cup one-on-one only on two wins was hauled up, not supported by the required two-thirds majority.'
b'The often very long, but just as importantly, Five-Satz Classics remain the traditional genre so far.'
b'66,54 percent of Member States voted for the reform, the goal of ITF President David Haggerty therefore was only nearly met.'
b'"We respect this decision, but are disappointed that our membership nations did not accept the entire reform package for the Davis Cup and Fed Cup.'
b'We need a change to secure the long-term future of these iconic and historic competitions," Haggerty said.'
b'You will continue to work to improve the bids.'
b'Nicht erst to vote, after many assaults, it was already there that the proposal was to vote out the final at a neutral place.'
b'New to 2018 are only comparatively minor details: So the semifinalists in the Davis Cup and Fed Cup will continue to have the host rights in the following year in the first round.'
b'To reduce the cost to the organisers, the demands in terms of training facilities, etc. will be reduced and the players will have less official media dates to complete prior to the Davis Cup.'
b'More than 1 out of 5 US travelers bring illegal items into the plane, a survey finds'
b'A survey among airborne passengers revealed that more than 20 percent accidentally or unconsciously smuggled illegal items at the controls of the U.S. Transportation Security Administration, including at least 6 percent who entered the plane while smuggling concealed weapons or other illegal'
b'More than 1 per cent claimed they had failed to discover that they were traveling irresponsibly with guns, ammunition or Spreadsheets.'
b'The survey at more than 1,000 people - conducted by a jet charter service, the Stratos Jet Charters Inc., also found that younger travelers were more likely to violate the rules.'
b'From the respondents who admitted knowingly trying to fly with something banned by the TSA, 19,7 percent were millennials, compared with less than 15 percent who were members of Generation X.'
b'The most common items smuggled to TSA agents abroad were food and liquids.'
b'More than 3 per cent admitted knowingly carrying items with knives through security, while 2,2 per cent of the female respondents and 3,7 per cent of the male respondents also confirmed that they were abducting illegal drugs into the plane.'
b'The company said it surveyed travellers throughout the country to find out how many accidentally brought smuggling goods through airport security and how many did it off their own.'
b"It's no surprise that the people who are the most likely to wear smugglingware - knowingly or unknowingly - through security were those who fly the most frequently."
b'The company, however, notes that the TSA policies are somewhat complicated and confusing.'
b'The people are often unsure which liquids they are allowed to take with them or how much of them.'
b'It is also no surprise that the largest amount of the TSA confiscated items are illegal drugs.'
b'A time or two ago, people thought the TSA could consider books to be cheating.'
b'FLIGHTS are allowed on domestic flights, however not on international flights.'
b"Elon Musk's it's all right: Thousands of Tesla Customers Cancel Order"
b'Elektro-Tausendsassa Elon Musk likes to give away with the huge number of pre-orders for his new Tesla "Model 3".'
b'However, he has previously stated that a portion of customers have already cancelled their initial reservation.'
b'Neben the always triumphant figures on sales growth and even gigantic sales targets, Tesla CEO Elon Musk has first revealed a different, less glamorous number: the number of cancellations at the new mass market model.'
b'He had been frequently tempted with the more than 500,000 pre-orders for the new car, whose outlay just begins.'
b'Now Musk admits: Of the total 518,000 pre-orders, 63,000 have already been drawn back.'
b'Critics had repeatedly pointed out that it was merely preliminary reservations.'
b'At a cancellation Tesla will refund the $1000 (in the US $1000 and in Britain $1000 pounds) "reservation deposit" fully.'
b'The company estimated there would be 455,000 of those preliminary reservations, Musk said in a phone call with analysts.'
b'That the cancellation of previously around twelve per cent of all orders could become a problem, the Tesla CEO does not believe, however.'
b'Your argument: The challenge at the ambitious growth targets is not the demand, but on the production side.'
b'In the past year, Tesla delivered 84,000 vehicles.'
b'2011 will be - all models together - 500,000, 2020 a million.'
b'The demand for it is obvious.'
b'Musk is currently getting 1800 reservations per day.'
b'If you order a "Model 3" early in the second year of 2018, you may be eligible for refurbishment - if Tesla manages to test its naked, never in practice tested production roads without any major undertakings with maximum output.'
b'Many experts doubt that this is possible.'
b'Coming to a tail end, though, then the unrestricted availability of reservations could become the problem for Tesla.'
b'And then the company can\xe2\x80\x99t stop unhappy customers from running into storms.'
b'EPA Chairman Pruitt pulls back because of the erosion of the rules of Obama Era to reduce greenhouse gas emissions'
b'A day after he had been arrested by 15 states, Scott Pruitt, the head of the Environmental Protection Agency, took back his earlier decision to delay implementation of the rules of Obama\xe2\x80\x99s era to reduce the emissions of smoke caused air pollution.'
b'Pruitt presented the change when his agency responded to the needs of state environmental authorities more reactionary than previous administrations.'
b'He did not mention the lawsuit filed against his previous position in a federal appellate court.'
b'It\xe2\x80\x99s about a deadline that expired on October 1 for states to meet the standards of 2015 for bodily ozone.'
b'Pruitt announced in June that he will delay compliance by a year to give his department more time to study the plan and to avoid "sitting into local decisions or hindering economic growth".'
b'Pruitt, who before his appointment by President Donald Trump was a prosecutor of Oklahoma, was longtime a reliable opponent of stricter environmental regulations.'
b'Since his arrival in Washington, Pruitt has repeatedly gone on to block or delay regulation that contradicts the chemical industry and the industry of fossil fuels.'
b'The sudden move from Tuesday is the most recent legal backlash for Pruitts regulatory rollback agenda.'
b'Last month, a federal appellate court in Washington ruled that the EPA regulator has exceeded its authority when attempting to implement a rule of the Obama administration that requires oil and gas companies to monitor and reduce methane emissions.'
b'In a Tuesday night\xe2\x80\x99s statement, Pruitt shouted that his knee-jerk stance on ozone standards quite simply strengthens the willingness of the EPA to cooperate with the states through the complex process of promptly meeting the new standards.'
b'"Unlike previous administrations, the EPA has often failed to abide by the deadlines for execution and then waited to be challenged by activist groups and others, and in a meeting to determine the date for execution," Pruitt, who chairs the EPA\'s'
b'"We don\'t believe in a regulation through court proceedings, and we take deadlines seriously.'
b'We also take the law and authority it gives us seriously."'
b'However, the statement by the EPA indicated that Pruitt will eventually use its "power to delay and all other legally available full powers" to ensure that regulations "are based on a solid policy and the best available information."'
b'The Republicans in Congress are pushing for a comprehensive rewrite of the Ozone rules.'
b'An in the last month approved bill will delay implementation of the rules from 2015 by at least eight years.'
b'The measure has not yet been put to vote in the Senate.'
b'The New York general counsel Eric Schneiderman, who headed the coalition of states that had filed the EPA in this week, said the group intends to keep legal pressure off.'
b'"The move by the EPA - after our lawsuits - is an important win for the health and safety of these 6.2 million New Yorkers and the over 115 million Americans directly affected by the smoke that floods their communities," Schneiderman said.'
b'New York joined in this case California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Indiana, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington and the District of Columbia.'
b'Water-ozone occurs when harmful chemicals from cars, power plants, oil refineries, chemical plants and other sources in the atmosphere react to sunlight.'
b'The generated smoke can cause serious breathing problems in sensitive groups of people, and contribute to tens of thousands of premature deaths every year.'
b'Representatives of the public health sector and environmentalists were juggling Pruitt\xe2\x80\x99s surprising course of action.'
b'"It is disturbing how much pressure it takes to get this reasonable move taken by the responsible for protecting the air we breathe," said Lori Ann Burd of the Center for Biological Diversity.'
b'"We must continue to fight against the ideological crossroads of the Trump administration, appealing to environmentalists and their special interests".'
b"Kleedkamers celebrates 750th Anniversary of St. Hilary's Church"
b'50 Years of St. Hilary Church: At the anniversary of the Berg Church, on the old cemetery estate in Tumlingen on Sunday, July 16th, at 5:30 p.m., there will be a Serenade.'
b'Of its idyllic location and lovely views of the town, the historic St. Hilary Avenue is a popular place to stay.'
b'The visitors of the sixth Benefiz Summit can be delighted by this powerful place.'
b'The rescue and preservation of the old building in the town have been the friends and supporters of Tumlingens to their cause.'
b'Martini states: "It\'s a unique village little thing".'
b'In 1267, the St. Hilary Chapel was first recorded in the W\xc3\xbcrttembergic census: Governor Hermann of Sulz sold "the mountain with the adjacent parish church to Tumlingen samt the voodoo" to Magister Eberhard of Horb. This was the first time'
b"The wording of the transcript indicates that on the Tumlinger mountain, apart from the apostle's church, was also a heritage farm to which the church or patronage was attached and not omitted."
b'There also lived people there.'
b'As per the description of the chief\'s pleasure city of 1858, next to the underton and the upperton, which are still to be seen in the town\'s image of Tumlingen right now, was the "Berg" the third, the heritage-like siege of'
b'Historical maps dating back to the year 1600 underline these geological facts.'
b'The patronage law was derived from the early medieval proprietorship law.'
b'A man who built a church, equipped it, and filled it with a parlor continued to be embroiderer of this church and could sustain this propriety as well.'
b'Therefore, the right was to appoint a parish priest or propose to the bishop a new parish priest.'
b'Two alts were there in the church and two bells on the turf.'
b'The larger of the two breaks at Christmas 1673.'
b'The newly-assembled Glory then first erupted in 1692, but later had to be dropped in the Second World War in 1942.'
b'In the 30-year war (1616 to 1648), the window chandeliers were assaulted and the gong seat stolen.'
b'The roof was undone.'
b'1896 French troops were stored in front of the church.'
b'They broke out the canoes and church stools and used them as fuel.'
b'Overseas churches were threatening to collapse in 1809.'
b'By 1869, the Tumlinger Hilarius cemetery also served as the last resting place for the dead from H\xc3\xb6rschweiler.'
b'1823 the cemetery was expanded and the Hilary Church was abandoned.'
b'Left the castle you let stand.'
b"In the New Year's Eve 1834, a storm split the cemetery and half struck."
b'To prevent an accident, the turbine was stopped.'
b"Only the present-day Turning Tree remained intact as a witness of the 750-year-old church's history."
b'Today, Horst Carpenter and Rolf-Dieter Wasem of the "Shadow Renters" as the replacement of Dieter Dockhorn maintain the Hilary\'s office.'
b'As a sponsor, the Friends and Supporters of Tumlingen invite you to join us on Sunday, July 16th for the sixth Serenade on the old cemetery to St. Hilary Chapel.'
b'Gestalt this by the Combo of Kepler High School Joy City and with word-of-mouth commentary by Kurt K\xc3\xbcbler and Reinhold Matteis.'
b'Locator Hartmut Romann speaks the final word.'
b'The program begins at 5:30 p.m.'
b'An entrance is at 15.30pm.'
b'For the sake of the Serenade, there will be a omelette before the cemetery.'
b'"Get a summer evening under the shade of old trees and with the wide view across forest to the forest," the organisers put out the fantastic view.'
b'The Serenade only takes place at dry weather.'
b'The organisers hope to attract many supporters for the preservation of the historic St. Hilary estate, which is of interest to Tumlingen and H\xc3\xb6rschweiler.'
b'The Friends and supporters of Tumlingen are particularly committed to homelessness, as Serenade organizer Walter Martini points out.'
b'Association will be able to review approval of wind turbines'
b'"Boismouth is wringing its hands" does not see any legal requirement for construction and has therefore appealed to the Landlord.'
b'The Association of "Boisheads" has urged Landlord Andrew Coenenen (CDU) to reconsider its approval for the construction of proposed wind turbines in Boishead\'s Nette.'
b'You are being lawfully conducted.'
b'The Association argues that at the time of approval on December 30, 2016, in Boise Nette, there would not even have been wind turbines approved, since to that date, in Vierse, there exists only one wind turbine conveyor belt at the city limits.'
b'Inner within this constraint zone, construction and operation of wind turbines are generally permitted, to the contrary, the constraint zone does not constitute an exclusion of wind energy use for the remaining city area.'
b'Lease Zones are intended to prevent a "reducing" of the landscape.'
b'The City of Vierzon had approved a second wind turbine contraction zone in the Boundary Nette a few days earlier by a change in land use plan - which but had not been approved by the District of Columbia, because of a form-error.'
b'"Due to the lack of planning law, the issued permit is after all legal and therefore also to be reversed," said Christopher Erkens, chairman of "Boishead Writers".'
b'Current status of things: The City Council voted again to renew the wind constraint zone in the Boundary Nette prior to the summer break; a permit from the District Council is yet to be issued.'
b'Erwin: "As a result, at this time, the issue of a permit for the construction of wind turbines is planning lawfully excluded".'
b'The count confirms the entry of the request.'
b'"The corresponding letters have been awaited at the County of Vierse since last week," a spokesperson explained.'
b'The count takes it for granted to investigate the matter again.'
b'They do not, but presumably do not, cause the process to be stopped.'
b'With respect to ongoing proceedings at the Verwaltungsgerichtshof, the county did not inquire into the argument of the Association\'s "Boishead whistleblowers."'
b'The NEW Re, a subsidiary of the NEW, is planning to build four jet engine wind turbines on a site at Boundary Nette.'
b'Starting in the past year, the company to which the city of Vierse is owned had closed lease agreements with the owner of the approximately 65 acres of land.'
b'With the construction of the four wind turbines, the electricity needs of around 11 400 households can be covered - which represents around one fifth of electricity needs of all fourth-generation households.'
b'The NEW Re wants to spend around $20 million.'
b'In the past summer, Viersens City Council gave green light for the purchase of three wind turbines in the Windpark Linnich at Akron, Ohio, as well as a participation in a wind turbine in \xc3\x9cbach-Palenberg in the county of Heinsberg.'
b'Auto and tractor collided: Woman dies in crushing accident'
b'One shocking traffic accident occurred Friday afternoon at 10 a.m. on the L 333 between Northern Ireland and Boiler Island (Rhineland).'
b'A woman was fatally injured while driving.'
b'Two other people were injured lightly.'
b'The countryside remained closed for over an hour.'
b'According to police reports, a 17-year-old young woman from Bornich was driving with her truck in the course of accompanied driving with her 53-year-old mother as a passenger.'
b'Towns and traders are planning "Heart-Shopping" weekends'
b'Langley Salzaer and people from around the region are expected to re-explore the shopping opportunities in downtown in September.'
b'The Commercial Association and City Council want to use the weekend of 8th and 9th September to attract residents to the shopping buzz in downtown.'
b'As the chairman of the Commercial Association, Christian King, announced, the "Heart Shoppers" weekend will educate customers about what offers the local city offers beyond usual grocery store wares.'
b'Planned to be themed a market with regional providers, similar to the weekly market.'
b'However, domestic firms will be presenting with their training programs.'
b'Additionally, the shops of downtown will be invited to "mining night shopping."'
b'It does not target only residents of the city and the nearest region.'
b'In preparation, advertisements in the radio, an internet video, and bespoke beads that point to the action weekend, according to Christian King.'
b'Municipality and Commercial Association are partners in doing so with the Industrial and Commercial Association.'
b'This way, the Commercial Association and the City will go into another installment of the project "Attracting Downtown".'
b'Includes new offerings such as the first "activity day" to the Brunch Fest along with thriving Sunday, conversations with all business owners and weavers to encourage them to join in the active participation.'
b'However, attractive offers on Saturday and the elimination of parking fees at this time of year are part of the concept.'
b'Therefore, clients\xe2\x80\x99 prospects are re-established or re-established.'
b'Some include curators and tourists.'
b'But even many immigrants would have lost sight of downtown when shopping.'
b'At the end of the day, everyone would have to contribute to reviving downtown - from owners, the businesses of the whole city and associations.'
b'It suggested using a network to overcome the lethargy that has been partly rooted out, King had said in the spring.'
b'Streich, director of the Iowa Center in Madison, stated that at the nation\'s third "home shopping" day, first five Texas cities will be participating.'
b'Additional to Langensalza, these are Weimar, S\xc3\xb6mmerda, Holy City, and Bletchley.'
b'The day "should be advertised for the value of local trade and its importance to the welfare of our cities," Streich said.'
b'The action undertaken by the IRS and with many partners also makes it clear that every citizen with their purchases can influence their direct environment.'
b'Two dead and several injured after explosion at US school'
b'During construction work, there was a gas explosion in the school building.'
b'New more people were injured.'

b'Trump put Mexico under pressure after bypassing transparencies of phone calls'
b'Transparencies of phone calls between US President Donald Trump and leaders of Mexico and Australia have been released by the Washington Post.'
b'On January 27, Trump called on President Donald Trump in a phone call with Mexican President Enrique Pe\xc3\xb1a Nieto to stop saying publicly that he would not pay for a proposed border wall.'
b'The US president insulted him because he had rejected the wall publicly. Reports say he said to him: "That you can\'t tell the press."'

b'Smith\xe2\x80\x99s Ford Massacre: Activists lead racist lynching as a call for justice'
b'A 1948 Ford Mercury drove through a group of audiences in the suburb of Monroe, Georgia, and rumbled up the Ford bridge of Moore.'
b'Behind the car that had four black passengers and a white driver reaching the bridge, a group of white men with rifles emerged to block its way.'
b'The operator of the Mobs - a man mid-aged in a navy blue suit - took a long train at his cigar and glanced inspectively through the windshield.'
b'Drowned, the occupants clenched their necks in fur.'
b'"We want this n ---- r Roger!" burst out the man.'
b'"Hold him out of the car!"'
b'Cheers broke the silence when a young black man was forced from the passenger seat.'
b'For the most part, this scary scene that was played on July 22, is just a afterthought.'
b'But when then a snake is thrown around the neck of "Roger", almost all in the audience threw out very real seams.'
b"Since 2005, citizens are coming back to Moore's Ford Bridge to witness the night after two black couples - Roger and Dorothy Malcom as well as George and Mae Murray Dorsey - were lynched by the Ku Klux Klan in 1946."
b'No one was ever arrested for murder.'
b'"It\'s really unbelievable that in all these years, no single person has been arrested - though we see them in our communities, though we know who they are," said Tyrone Brooks, who helps with the organization of the aftermath.'
b'"It\'s a scratch on a story, but it\'s a burden on our souls."'
b'Larry Brooks is a 71-year-old former congressman of the state of Georgia and a lifetime citizen lawyer.'
b'For him, the aftermath serves as a dramatic call to action and represents an annual reminder to the Monroe family that an unfairness has never been corrected.'
b'"We want punishment, we want the end, we want healing, we want reconciliation, but first we need to receive justice," he said.'
b'"We cannot get to healing and reconciliation until we receive justice."'
b'A courtesy nurse puts a bedside table over the body of one of the victims of the Moore Ford lymphade on July 27, 1946.'
b'According to FBI records obtained by the NBC News, more than 50 men from Monroe and the surrounding counties were arrested in the lynch process.'
b'But no one was ever arrested.'
b'While the suspects remain on bail for decades, citizens say the double motivation for the lynch actions in the whole city has always been known: politics and sex.'
b'In April 1946, a decision by the Supreme Court allowed black citizens in Georgia to vote for the first time, at the precinct election in the summer.'
b'Until the same time as the election, according to the FBI, the black farm peasant Roger Malcom stabbed a white groundskeeper, Barnett Hester, during a fight nevertheless - allegedly because of a woman.'
b'Larry Brooks said the rumor in the city was that Hester slept with Malcom\xe2\x80\x99s wife Dorothy and that the baby she wore wasn\xe2\x80\x99t from her husband.'
b'On July 25, 1946, Loy Harrison, a prominent white landlord, paid $600 to keep Malcom out of jail, according to the FBI.'
b'He was accompanied by Dorothy and her co-stars Mae Murray and George Dorsey to the prison.'
b"But when they then moved away from the prison and approached the Moore's Ford Bridge, a Lynchmob rolled the car."
b'"As it turns out, it was Harrison who prepared and administered the murders," concludes hereafter an FBI report.'
b'"It is also evident that there was a co-operation between the state and local criminal justice system, which not only participated in the murders, destroyed evidence, and falsely discredited the identity of witnesses".'
b'Larry Brooks makes it even more pronounced.'
b'"It was a voting rights massacre," he said.'
b'"They were all killed to send a message to black people in this community: "If you sign up and if you vote, then this will happen to you here."'
b'Once a decade ago, Cassandra Greene led the annual aftermath of the Moore Ford Bridge Lynch murders.'
b'Your presentation is atmospheric, insightful and is rooted in a kind of deep racism, of which many would like to believe it no longer exists in America.'
b'It\xe2\x80\x99s hard to look away, and even harder to look away, but Greene said that\xe2\x80\x99s the point.'
b'"We don\'t want to talk about lynching because we\'re then confronted with its sheer misery in us all," she said.'
b'"But I can\'t build a relationship with you if you don\'t want to listen to me or don\'t want to hear what I\'ve been through".'
b"The trials for this year's production began in June, and on the first day almost 30 actors - a dozen whites and the rest Blacks - drowned into a room and laughed as Greene started a well-executed account of the piece."
b"Wade Marbaugh is here to be Green's co-director."
b'He has been playing the role of the chief clan member for years, but he said the role will never be easier.'
b'"I\'m scared because I\'m not like that," Marbaugh said.'
b'"But I think it\'s very important to keep this story alive because we don\'t want to return to these times."'
b'On the other side of the room, the actors Darrius Bradshaw and Nick Rascona, who play Roger Malcom and Barnett Hester, tried their zeal.'
b'The piece begins with Malcom, who attacks Hester and threatens to kill him, whining that he slept with his wife Dorothy.'
b'"I said, n---- he, disappear from my property!"'
b'Cascona exclaims the fire.'
b"There's a break."
b'And then everyone (at least all black actors) burst into giggles.'
b'Greene is laughing the loudest.'
b'"What?!", Rascona asked.'
b'He is alarmed and confused.'
b'Are I being too hard?'
b'"No," Greene said, still kidding.'
b'"I just don\'t think white people used to say \'n --- he\'."'
b'"Desperately," laughed one of the other black darlings.'
b'"You just need to meet the hard \'R.\'."'
b'And just as the energy shifts in the room, a sense of camaraderie replaces the uncomfortability.'
b'Everyone is busy getting this right, not only because of the game, but also because of the reminder of the four killed people.'
b'The scene begins again.'
b'This time, when Rascona says the N word, he says it sharply and with emphasis.'
b'Absolutely no one is laughing.'
b'This repeat ends violently and quickly.'
b'There are cries, shouts, and then silence.'
b'A woman, dressed in a funeral suit, stands over the remains of the actors and leads Billie Holiday\'s devastating lobster "Strange Fruit."'
b'Your voice blows at every second word.'
b'Nevertheless, hundreds of feet away, a group of about four dozens of viewers are wisely wiping away sweat and tears from their eyes.'
b'The audience is split almost equally between black and white.'
b'A couple is from Ithaca, New York, angry to see the performance, many just coming down the street.'
b"They have all spent at least eight hours experiencing Georgia's stubborn fever when Brooks leads them on a pilgrimage to the graves of the Malcoms and Dorseys."
b'By this point, the murders have remained an anecdote, but now that you\xe2\x80\x99re on the same country where the Lynch murders took place, the air feels suppressed.'
b'When the last notes of the song are out, Greene invites the crowd to get closer and inhale the leap of faith.'
b'Kids are hopping at their calves, registering the fake blood and the still body and frozen to each other.'
b'"They\'re not really dead," murmurs a little boy as if to remind himself.'
b"After a few minutes Greene thanks the crowd - and suddenly it's over."
b'The actors throw away the lynch seat and wipe away their tears.'
b'Bradshaw hugs Marbaugh, the man in the attic who played the clan member.'
b'Rascona hugs two of his fellow players and then bounces in their arms weeping, the emotional burden of the performance finally blasting through at him.'
b'"It\'s okay," flounces one of the women.'
b'"We know that this is not in your heart.'
b'You did that for a reason."'
b'Later, the audience sits down with the actors for dinner.'
b'At a table, a white couple from Atlanta is angry about the aftermath of dating a black couple they just met.'
b'Denise Duplinski struggled to find words to describe what feeling the performance left behind.'
b'"It\'s hard to hear these scary words and actions... coming from people who look like you yourself and who do that because they look like you," she said.'
b'"What this really does with me is let me believe that the lynching is still going on," she added, "now that\'s just police shooting."'
b'In the same room, Tyrone Brooks holds his farm at his table, he is eating and reminding us of citizen rights.'
b'He said he has already started planning the performance in the next year.'
b'"The aftermath is inspiring in some sense, because it captures the shock of what we\'ve endured, but it\'s also a moment of learning," he said.'
b'"It\'s like if we learn nothing from it, then it can happen again.'
b'If you don\'t study your own history, whoever doesn\'t know your own history is accused of repeating it."'
b'"God\'s mercy" conquered the Wagnerians in Baylor'
b'Even in the fourth part of Richard Wagner\xe2\x80\x99s monumental work, director Frank Castorf puts on a colorful incarnation of gigantic, six-story cast.'
b'The set (designed by Aleksandar Denic) shows clunky street scenes including Mausoleum and D\xc3\xb6nerbuds in New York City, a "Place and Elm" logo from WWII times, or the New York Stock Exchange.'
b'That\xe2\x80\x99s where an open-top Mercedes-Benz Oldtimer parks in front of the Rheint\xc3\xb6chter posing as Rockergirls, or alternatively an Isetta.'
b'Gestures of oil refineries remind us of Castor\'s motto - Money, power and glory - that draws through his "Ring" incarnation.'
b'The three River Twins - sung by Stephanie Houtzeel, Howbke Lee and Alexandra Steiner - harmonize like never before in the "Rheingold" wonderfully.'
b'Kim kissed them Siegfried (Stefan Vinke), breaking in Hollywood-style a leak into the cupboard and giving the Krawallo-Clique.'
b'Stephen Milling sings the glorious haunting haunting that surrounds the aura of a heavyweight boxer.'
b'Brutal the scene when he erects Siegfried.'
b'Later, too, Gunther (Mark Eagan) has to believe in it.'
b'The audience thankes it to the ensemble with vigorous applause.'
b'Slightly celebrated are Foster, Milling, Vinke, and Dirigent Janowski, who is humble and hands the hands to the Clinton race for the most part.'
b"Great appreciation is given for the festival's orchestra, which first shows up on stage - at the height of the great heat again in casual casual clothing."
b'With anticipation was expected the appearance of Frank Castorf and his directorial team.'
b'Didn\'t he have another yellow pipe concert over there in 2013? Five years later, there was big giggle in the row of "Buh" ruffles.'
b'Festival director Catherine Wagner may have gotten excited about it.'
b'"You realize the audience has grown up with the "Ring" in certain ways," she had said shortly before the performance of the dpa.'
b'The audience not only made a form of peace with Castorf, but it also grew an understanding of his viewpoint.'
b"I'm going to see a positive response."

b'I could recognize my own strengths and see how it really works out.'
b'As opposed to the construction engineering degree?'
b"Number: Well, this isn't about figuring out Statics."
b'You always have other people wrapped around your head who each have a very different story behind them.'
b'Whether a refugee, whether a teenager who got out of the family - you always have to work individually on it.'
b'Very interesting. Thanks for sharing.'
b'And you didn\xe2\x80\x99t have any touchy-feely?'
b"Number: For now, I'm not the type."

b'"For the future, it will be like no one is going to put up next to Michael (Rensing) on the line."'
b'Larry Hogan is convinced that his team will perform better even after the experiences in preparation with the three-man roster than with the four-man roster.'
b'"No, I don\'t know how we\'ll be acting in Auburn," says his coach Friedhelm Funkel, yet Harrison is confident of his cause, "because we\'re just in the three-way tie on the half-time positions in Kaan Ay'
b'"Probably, though, that we\'re even more harmonious and we don\'t afford to make so many interruptions in the build."'
b'It also drives Harrison to Auburn to win the game.'
b'"Obviously, though, after an unfortunate start, you can talk about a failed start, I don\'t know.'
b'The performance might indeed be okay," Hoffman said.'
b'"Falls we get there on Sunday with four points and can concentrate on the playoffs, we will certainly be able to talk about a decent season start."'
b"Devon didn't want his coach to know anything."
b'"The start to the season ebbs and flows only after six to eight games," said Friedhelm Funkel, who doesn\'t want to talk about a benefit to Auburn just because the game of the Southern side had to be cancelled prematurely because of an accident.'
b'"Now they can start the season almost with a home game," Funkel said and Harrison believes the players from Auburn might even be slightly fresher as they wouldn\'t have a hard and complete game like Pacquiao against a surging favorite in the bones.'
b'"But they don\'t know as 100-percent where they\'re currently standing," says the insiders of the Cardinals.'
b'ZERO expectations for the guests from the Rhode Islands as easily favourites to go into the match on Sunday in the finally (very) finished stadium of Auburn.'
b'"That we fire them away just because we have the claim to get under the first seeds is bullshit," says Funkel, whose balance at just one loss to Auburn out of nine games is indeed positive.'
b'"There\'s no team in the 2nd division that you have to beat from scratch," Fortune\'s chief coach explains.'
b'"To make such a statement would be arrogant and overheard".'
b'And so Funkel wants to see his players perform on Sunday on a regular basis.'
b'New results of Swedish Asylum Surveys released'
b'The recent results of tests for asylum seekers in Sweden, subject to a new methodology for medical assessment of their age, show that more than 80 per cent of the tested individuals are older than 18 years of age. But not everyone believes in the accuracy of the data.'
b'The Swedish Department of Forensic Sciences (R\xc3\xa4ttsmedicinal Sciences) has started conducting the tests in the past year.'
b'They are expected to make more accurate assessments of age during the asylum process after the Swedish Migration Office (Migrations Office) was criticised for making mistakes in determining the correct age of some refugees who were minors.'
b'As of today Migrationsverket has sent 6.880 to test cases and the Forensic Medicine Agency has now released the results of total 2.481 tests from the period from mid March to July 31, 2017.'
b'Fourteen percent (2002) were judged to be 18 or older, while in another 25 cases the Forensic Medicine Agency ruled that the person was "probably 18 years or older."'
b'In 432 cases, the conclusion was that the person was "possibly under 18 years of age".'
b'The tests are only performed in cases where the age of the person is in question.'
b'According to Johan G\xc3\xb6ransson of the Forensic Medicine Agency, the results have been consistent at the past few months.'
b'"We don\'t see a big difference in the statistics of the past few months, the numbers are pretty consistent," he told The Local.'
b'The high percentage of cases where the person was assessed as over the age of 18 does not necessarily mean that the asylum seeker lied about his age.'
b'In May, the agency released the results of 581 tests and said there were 441 cases that suggested that the examined person was 18 years or older.'
b'When the newspaper Svenska Dagbladet examined the 581 published results, it found that in 243 of these cases the person had offended openly that she would be 18 in this year.'
b'The methodology of medical age assessment, whereby radiation imaging of weak spots and MRI imaging of knee joints, which are then analyzed by dentists and radiologists, has also been criticized in some areas.'
b'A skeptic is the endocrinologist Claude Marcus of the Karolinska Institute, whose work involves examining the biological maturity of people to see if they went through puberty earlier or later than usual.'
b'"I had reason to think about it, and I don\'t think the type of measurement should be used.'
b'The biological age to be considered on this basis is very uncertain.'
b'If we can\'t say it safely, we shouldn\'t do as if we could," he told the newspaper Metro.'
b'Jinansson of the Forensic Medicine Agency, however, defended the accuracy of the tests: "In general, you can say that the risk of undiagnosed a child as an adult is low.'
b'The biggest risk is when the person is nearly under 18, in this case this is roughly 10 per cent."'
b'Full-full-full-full-full-full-full-full-full-full-full-full-full-full-full-full-full-full-full-full-full-full-full-full-full-full-full-full-full-full-full-'
b'The work on the three bridges of Land Road 108 between Lauterbach and Schramberg is well underway.'
b'On Tuesday, a seven-ton concrete section was installed at the bridge at the Eastern Orthodox Church of Lauterbach.'
b'"We\'re very good in time, it\'s running great," says Reinhold Leicht, building director at the department of roads and bridges in the government department.'
b'In April, work began simultaneously at all three restored bridges between Schramberg and Lauterbach.'
b'The build-up is scheduled for October and Leigh is confident the timeline will be adhered to.'
b'The first bridge, coming from Schramberg, passes over the Trombach.'
b'It is a stormbogen bridge made of concrete covered with red bush sandstone and has an overall length of 4,80 feet.'
b'Building was made in the year 1900.'
b'As for the two other bridges as well, it is now in the years to come.'
b'To ensure durability and traffic safety, the three buildings are now being gently restored.'
b'The two other bridges lead over to the Lauterbach.'
b'They are made of red bush sandstone.'
b'Both were built in 1939 and are twelve, respectively, 10,60 feet long.'
b'The bridge at the town of Lauterbach has now received a 1,30-yard wide and seven-ton so-called bridge cap on Tuesday morning on the north side.'
b'This is a center bench that is also used as an operational pathway.'
b'At the southern end of the bridge, a 2,20-foot bridge cap will be used on Friday.'
b"That's where the pedestrian path will then be crossed."
b"The special thing about it is that it is made of fabrication parts, a patent of Schramberger's company Dizwo."
b'The other two bridges are already fitted with the patented bridge caps.'
b'Special touches have required the dismantling of wires through the building in Lauterbach.'
b'And there is also a glass fibre cable connecting many companies.'
b'The residents were informed in advance of the work by hand signs about the project.'
b'However, initially, fish and shellfish were being fished off.'
b'For the bridges between the building building and Sacred Hill in the direction of Schramberg, traffic is acted as a pedestrian bridge by an aisle.'
b'For construction work at the bridge at Lauterbach Orthodox Church, the road in the area of the bridge on the corner of the Hotels "Tannenhof" and "Sieben Linden" is fully closed.'
b'The cost of the three bridge repairs amounts to $700,000.'
b'Financially, the whole thing is through the country.'
b'Affordable Housing in Gerontopolis: Blessed Protest at American Carnival'
b'It\xe2\x80\x99s not that common to see parties pulling at a straw, but when it comes to the Alternative for America (AfD), it comes together, which is otherwise just hard to put under one\xe2\x80\x99s skin.'
b'The incumbents of Vulcaneifel (CDU, Democrats, Republicans, FDP, FWG, Republicans) are part of a broad coalition that is bound to show peaceful flags at this time because the Affordable Care Act in the Gerolstein'
b'And well-known names are coming to the rescue - like Alice Weidel, who will be joining Alexander Graham for the House of Representatives on September 24, and the appointed Secretary of State Beatrice of Storch.'
b'But those who are present for hours before the start of the event don\xe2\x80\x99t want to listen to the Affordable Care Act folks, but demonstrate.'
b'The theme "The Eagle Stays Bright".'
b'Urgently, the city\'s picnic was planned under the motto "All at a table" on the Brunswick Place, but now takes place on the parking lot below the Rondell - and thus right before the eyes of those attending the Affordable Care Act event in the city'
b"A bucket of imagery that's available there."
b'And what Christa Karoli, co-founder of Forum One World and one of the most influential organizers, is rightly thrilled: "To see how many people have come together here".'
b'There\'s music and plenty of food, including an "urgerished cartridge salad that even the Affordable Care Act could eat problem-free," says the woman who brought him.'
b'The police have ordered many officers to arrive to Gerolstein, it shows presence mainly at the railway station, which is just a few metres away from the event venues.'
b'How is the Affordable Care Act actually coming to Gerolstein?'
b'Larry Hompes of the Affordable Vulnerable Care Foundation reports he has been working hard for such an event and got the grant.'
b'The 45-year-old from Glasgow had initially been asked to live in Daun, but got a demotion because because of the already built Laurentius Church, there were not enough parking spaces available.'
b'Now for the Rondell, Hompes says that "we can have such a nice event here".'
b'With regards to the event on the Rondell front, he says: "This is the good right of people, mainly, it stays peaceful".'
b'That\xe2\x80\x99s what it\xe2\x80\x99s all about too: At around 20 p.m., on the Rondell front porch, there\xe2\x80\x99s a band for entertainment, in the city hall, diverse speakers, including the rhetorical Republican Uwe Junge.'
b'In the auditorium, there are about 200 listeners waiting for the top candidate for Congressman, Alice Weidel, and the appointed Secretary of State, Beatrice Storch to hold their talks.'
b'Unchanged is police presence, but previously, officers had a quiet evening.'
b'And something like an hour into the Affordable Care Act event, the guests on the front porch have a longer breath, but even there is shortly after 21 p.m. cleaning up is advisable.'
b'The police can assault - no special incidents.'
b'Posada meets the Trompet'
b"A rehearsal with the Wolf Creek Posada's Frederic Belli will be in the series Haslam's Cathedral Concerts tomorrow, Sunday, at 20 p.m. in the Cathedral."
b'Joined by the Bulgarian Trompeter Miroslav Petkovic, he gives a concert entitled "Black Sea meets Black Lake", or just "Baltic Folklore" meets a classic American education with roots in Blasmusik.'
b'Both of the two are winners and prize winners of numerous international competitions and have held solo positions in European top orchestras.'
b'So Petkovic is a solo piano player at the prestigious Concertgebouw Orchester Amsterdam and Frederick Belli is a solo piano player at the SWR Symphony Orchestra.'
b'Both combine the desire to transcend not only the boundaries on their instruments, but also the boundaries of the different genres.'
b'So, Johann Sebastian Bach sings at the two of them like in a new way, Daniel Schnyder\'s "world music" combines Bulgarian folk, and in the piece "Exchange Suite" by jazzecho finalist Nils Wogram, classical, jazz and jazz combine to create a'
b'This core piece of the program was first released this spring with huge success in Birmingham.'
b'The renowned composer Nils Wogram has written it his own for the two musicians and more importantly: The Haslacher Monastery with its special akustik is intentionally incorporated into the concert.'
b'Stewart talks about her bisexuality'
b'"A lot of people love grilled cheese and will eat it till the end of their lives.'
b'But I want to try everything," Kristen Stewart said quite openly about her bisexuality.'
b'"When I once ate in grilled cheese, I think: \'Oh that was cool, what comes next?\'."'
b'The most well-known relationship of the Hollywood star was the one with her "Twilight" co-star Robert Pattinson, which ultimately ended up bitterly disagreeing.'
b'Yet despite all that, the brunette actress admits to the "Harper\'s Bazaar" magazine: "I was seriously jealous of everyone I\'ve dated.'
b'But do you suppose I would have played it?"'
b'After their separation, Kristen admitted that she was bisexual: "I\'ve always lived the dualism and seriously believed in it.'
b'It has also never confused or hindered me.'
b'I just never liked to be taken seriously."'
b'Especially, according to "Bang Showbiz" but in high school, when she preferred to dress like a bub: "Not all girls are typical girls.'
b'That really hurt me.'
b'When I was eleven the kids told me I would look like a bub.'
b'I really felt attacked, intimidated and humiliated.'
b'Now I look back and think: \'Mom, be proud of you!\'."'
b'Most of the public doesn\'t like to reveal her love life: "People expect you to behave on a certain level and that\'s what annoys me.'
b'And perhaps some consider me rude, but I don\'t like to be justified before the whole public."'
b"The Governor of West Virginia announces he's changing the party"
b'. The Democratic Governor of West Virginia, Jim Justice, announced Thursday night at a rally with President Trump that he will change the party.'
b'Whether you like it or not, Democrats have moved away from me," Governor Justice said.'
b'"Hear me tell you with many prayers and much thought... today I will tell you as a resident of West Virginia, I can no longer help you if I am a democratic Governor."'
b'The crowd burst into giggles.'
b'"Morning, I will change my registration to the Republicans," Justice added.'
b'"As a coach, I\'d say it\'s time to play another game."'
b'Mr. Trump promised a big announcement before the West Virginia rally.'
b'Mr. Trump won West Virginia with 42 points, and Justice did not approve of the Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton.'
b'Justice, who according to Forbes is the only billionaire in the state, was elected in 2016.'
b'Forbes states that he owns coal mines in five states, and has been raised by his father.'
b"He's worth roughly $1.59 billion."
b'In the meantime, the Republikan National Committee gave a statement on Wednesday night, in which it said: "The party move by Governor Justice is another blow to a Democratic party that would rather hinder us than work to make our country great again."'

b'Coe lobbies "easy" Russian apology for doping scandal'
b'The world\xe2\x80\x99s top athlete, Sean Coe, praised what he described as an open endorsement from Russia to a doping scandal, but he repeatedly said it was not the moment for the country to get back into the sport.'
b'China\xe2\x80\x99s Leichtathlete Dmitry Shylakh said during the IAAF convention on the pre-season of the Leichtathlete World Championships that the ban on his country from sport was correct and that he was enthusiastic about it.'
b'He said it hurts for "all the athletes who got away with getting gold and silver medals at competitions."'
b'Despite his comments, the IAAF Congress voted for upholding the ban, which was suspended in November 2015 after a report by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) found evidence of state-sponsored doping in Russia.'
b'"I thought it was a very open answer today, a very honest presentation," IAAF President Coe told reporters.'
b'"The entire council and the entire Congress were delighted to see that the Russian Federation has recognized at once that it has experienced some pretty hot times and will do whatever it takes to ensure that the Federation is rebuilt."'
b'Coe said he is also "excited" that Russia will accept the criteria for its reintegration.'
b'"I think it was a very constructive day, and I think progress has been made, but the Congress supports the recommendations of the Task Force that this is not the moment to reject Russia," Coe said.'
b'"We need to do all we can in the next months to normalize this situation.'
b'The principle was always that we wanted to separate the clean athletes from the corrosive system," he added'
b'New Russian athletes will compete at the Leichtathletik World Championships, which begin on Friday in London, subject to the strict IAAF rules as neutral actors.'
b'The head of the IAAF Task Force, Rune Andersen, said on Monday that Russia still needs to meet some of the criteria for a resettlement.'
b'Drugs are still unnecessarily expensive and banned coaches are still free agents, he told reporters in London after a talk at the IAAF Council.'

b'"We condemn this highest sacrifice they have rendered in the name of the United States," she explained.'
b'The 33-year-old Major and the 47-year-old Stabsman from North Dakota were killed in western Mali on Tuesday.'
b'Your siblings were overseas and brought to America on Wednesday accompanied by a death row troop of the United States Army.'
b'At noon, initially only the loved ones in the church took leave.'
b'Then the funeral began in the circle of family, close friends, of representatives of the Army as well as the policy.'
b'That included Heath Ledger (CDU) and the General Inspector General of the Army Corps of Engineers John Howker.'
b'Funeral guests laid down roses, the loved ones stood arm in arm at the stems.'
b'Before the church, Fritzlarer and numerous soldiers watched the ceremony on a leaky roof.'
b'Minister of Defense described the surviving soldiers as "holy decorated" and avid combat veterans.'
b'The Stairmaster has built the flight operation of the Fighting Tiger in Fritzlar with it and has been one of the first six trained fighter pilots of his regiment.'
b'But Volker Bauersachs, commander of the regiment to which the soldiers belong, explained: "If this invasion could not stop the decline, then no one would have consented".'
b'Never doubting the UN mission in Mali, ministry of the Interior did not show: The operation was dangerous.'
b'But he is also of high importance "for a country of which we are only separated by two states," she said.'
b'After the funeral, the sailors were brought out of the dome.'
b'When and where they are buried, the Pentagon made no specifics.'
b"Prince Henrik doesn't want a grave next to his wife"
b"The husband of Denmark's Queen Margrethe (77), Prince Henrik (83), does not want to be buried next to his wife after his death."
b"That's according to the Queen's House on Wednesday."
b"Traditionally, the Danish King's family is buried in the Domicile Church of Roskilde."
b'The photographer Bj\xc3\xb8rn Sundf\xc3\xb8r already finished a sarcophagus for the two of them.'
b'The queen was pleased with the decision of her husband, it further stated in the notice.'
b'Where Prince Henrik will be buried is yet to be determined.'
b'He did not have but the intention of being at sea in his French home.'
b'Prince Henrik never made a hesitancy that he was not happy with his title.'
b'After the coronation of his wife Marguerite in 1972 he would have liked to be King.'
b'Years ago he went into retirement and is also taking off the title of "Prinzgemahl".'

b'Where the final resting place of the 83-year-old will ultimately be will remain unknown.'
b'He did not have but the intention of being at sea in his French home, but in Denmark.'

b'Even for the Gauloises I smoked at the expense of Virginia Tabak and who had the reputation of being the brand of sociological intellectual, I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t hope for Nacho.'

b'Because he spoke on Friday for the closure of Parliament.'
b'Together with the unexpected withdrawal of a Republican candidate from her state Senate seat in Minnesota, the government of Prime Minister Stephan Weil (Donald Trump) had slipped into a severe crisis.'
b'Three months before the official date of landmark elections, the Red Cross in Atlanta lost its nearly one-third majority in the House of Representatives to the Opposition from Democrats and Republicans.'

b'Europe debates about contaminated eggs.'
b'How did the scandal happen?'
b'How can consumers protect themselves.'
b'Minister of Interior Christian Schmidt (CDU) is in the interview with the Editors Network of America (RND).'
b'Mr. Schmidt, How can the consumer protect themselves from frying eggs?'
b'I can only encourage all consumers to look at the eggs in your refrigerator closely and check the scoop pressure.'
b'On the consumer protection portal www.lifesafetywarning.gov, the states provide the most up-to-date information about the affected egg charging.'
b'Patients should be dismissed or returned.'
b'However, based on everything we know currently, a health hazard is practically impossible.'
b'Do you now assume Aldi is taking the best possible crisis response - all eggs out of the offer - because the central role of the surrogate is not really perceived by the federal government?'
b'The food security is the responsibility of the states.'
b'However, my house has been promptly turned on and has been in close contact with the authorities of the countries since the announcement of the abuse of America.'
b'All information and risk assessment is available for consumers.'
b'The trade has as well as the manufacturers to ensure that the sold products are safe and health-conscious.'
b'If eggs have the retention threshold of 0.05mg/kg above, these are not toxic.'
b'Uncooked eggs, however, can be sold and eaten.'
b'This time, not the businesses are blamed.'
b'Setting production operations and consumers in the same boat?'
b'According to current knowledge, the production operations are not directly liable.'
b'Moreover, they must face economic damage due to suspected illegal practices by service providers.'
b'As always, in the meantime, there are too few controls.'
b'Does it justify the staff or even the clever tower?'
b'It was indeed just the amnesty controls that exposed the process.'
b'To the truth, however, food fraud and criminal energy can never be tolerated.'
b'Just because a consistent surveillance of those events and the transfer to the prosecutors in the cases where offences may be committed is of vital importance.'
b'I have already stated more than once that I expect from the responsible authorities a lightening up.'
b'Is the regular alarmism associated with food scandals really necessary?'
b'The consumers have the right to get only safe and viable foods.'
b'If a non-tobacco ingredient is used in the food industry, consumers are to blame.'
b'By using bogus means, manufacturers, traders and consumers are in a situation that is absolutely not necessary.'
b'Finally, it must be clear: The legal use of the insecticide Fipronil in the care of livestock supplies is not hinted at and must be stopped immediately.'
b'That\xe2\x80\x99s why on all levels, it needs to be consistently and with high levels of effort.'
b'I expect from all concerned authorities that the matter is promptly and thoroughly investigated.'
b'How the financial rules of football will affect Neymar\xe2\x80\x99s move to Paris'
b'The rules aimed at preventing improper spending by European football clubs won\xe2\x80\x99t bother Neymar\xe2\x80\x99s world record transfer from the Spanish Barcelona to the French Paris Saint-Germain.'
b'Irrelevant consequences will still be coming for Paris Saint-Germain from the UEFA, because the executive organisation that oversees the European game has the power to ban teams from accessing the prestige Champions League tournament.'
b'Financial Fairness Rules, which were in place in 2011 by the UEFA, mean that PSG eventually needs to prove that the transfer of Neymar was financed without major losses.'
b'Barcelona has paid 222 million euros (262 million $) to buy the Brazilian out of his contract, and Neymar will receive a salary that will be several ten million dollars per year.'
b'Here are some of the financial aspects of Neymar\xe2\x80\x99s move to France.'
b'Manchester United can withhold the money so that Neymar signs and brings him into a galaxy of other stars, considering the financing of the team by the by the energy remarkable rulers family of Qatar.'
b'Organizations may spend a lot of money for the purchase of players, but must compete with legitimate income sources that allow them to make the break-even point in their on-the-go business.'
b'FFP was designed by Michel Platini after his election to the UEFA president in 2007.'
b'The former French player believed that clubs who had taken huge debts on themselves in their quest for success effectively abused and risked ruining themselves when banks or owners returned their support.'
b'In 2011, FFP shifted from condemning the debts of clubs to monitoring their losses.'
b'The change meant that the business model that Roman Abramovich used to use in Chelsea back in 2003 - buying a club with potential and then spending heavily to improve the team and build a global brand - should become a harder proposition.'
b'During the current three-year FFP mandate, which runs through 2018, clubs may face losses in excess of $30 million.'
b'And although Platini has fallen in love with the presidency in 2015, his UEFA native Aleksei Ceferin continues to insist on stopping from excessive spending.'
b'"Situationally, FFP is not dead and we will probably still strengthen the rules for the future," said Andrea Traverso, who is at the UEFA for FFP, to The Associated Press in the past week.'
b'While the Saints paid the buy-out clause of Neymar in a flat rate, it can distribute the amount for accounting over the duration of his contract.'
b'Lionel Messi has signed a five-year deal, so the departure sum can be expended for the next five years in excess of $44.1 million in year-end.'
b'The first wave of FFP sanctions in 2014 has hit the Saints along with Abu Dhabi, which is in the possession of Manchester City, with the most severe sanctions.'
b"The Saints received a fine of \xc2\xa360 million (dated to \xc2\xa382 million), which later was reduced to \xc2\xa320 million - and it was advised that the team's members for the Champions League season 2014/15 remain limited to 21 players instead of the otherwise normal 25 players."
b'The UEFA is on the lookout for clubs who could try to surpass its financial surveillance by blowing up their revenues through companies associated with the owners of a club.'
b'While a catastrophic company could sponsor the PSG if the value of sponsorship should exceed the standard market rates, the UEFA would not consider this a legitimate income.'
b'Just that happened in 2014, when the UEFA decided that the value of sponsorship of the PSA was uplifted by the Qatar Tourism Authority.'
b'It was reported that a portion of the PSG payments to Neymar could come about payments from the organisational body of the ICC in Doha.'
b'But PSG and Qatar 2022 have bestowed on Neymar to become FIFA ambassador and a derby could easily be out of reach for the UEFA regulatory authorities.'
b'The current sanctions against ENGIE mean that the UEFA will be even more alert to any attempt to circumvent the rules.'

b'Swiss is on the lookout for a new chocolate supplier'
b'In the past few years, Chocolat Frey has made Border Chocolate for the Swiss.'
b'Now the swift cooperation is about to come to a possible end: The airline is rewriting the contract.'
b'Swiss ambassador Meike Fuhlrott confirmed on behalf of the news agency sda an appropriate report by the newspaper "Nordwest Wales" on Friday.'
b'According to current planning, the airline will close a new contract in the first half of 2018.'
b'The products would be checked every two to three years and subject to a quality control.'
b'"With the current supplier Chocolat Frey, we are very pleased," the spokeswoman said.'
b'About 17 million small red-winged chocolate tablespoons to 14 pounds distribute per year to the air crews before landing to the passengers.'
b"Over the cost, the Swiss didn't want to make any figures."
b'Manufacturing insiders estimate the contract volume to be estimated to be $1.5 to $2 million - the Migros tower generates a year-on-year revenue of around $1 billion.'
b'But more importantly, all of that is the advertising impact: For a chocolate manufacturer, it\xe2\x80\x99s a prestige job.'

b'As a cultural artifact, it is equally a parody and a representation of our Facebook-able era of perpetual memories.'

b'"First Day of Camp" worked surprisingly well, not only because of its ridiculous humor (it encompassed an original story for a talking doughnut that was spoken by H. Jon Benjamin).'
b'In order to hide away from the core of the gag - actors of middle age playing fucked up kids who will grow up - they still managed to gain the last part of the joke back.'

b'Many of the central stories are the same.'
b'The delightful Coop (Mr. Showalter), now a novelist, has never forgotten Katie (Marguerite Moreau).'
b'Victor (Ken Marino) has not lost his boyhood yet.'
b"And there's another insane-bad plot that involves Ronald Reagan (along with Mr. Showalter) who is now supported by George H.W. Bush (a well-crafted impression of Michael Ian Black)."
b'As always, the extensive classes are the best part of the franchise.'
b'It\'s especially fun to see the epic young Mr. Rudd showing Matt Dillon\'s underwear from "Singles", whose former Big-Man-on-Camp Andy now feels like an old knight.'
b'It\'s the moments to be damned that this franchise could assert as a sort of repeating "Seven Up!" series until it reaches what I consider its logical conclusion: "Wet Hot American Summer: Twelve Years Later."'

b'The by Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka created comedy with Rhys Thomas as director gives way to a found TV series: a rumoured drama of the eighties with the two police officers as friends, two officers from Bukarest who are in love.'
b'The main roles - a hard-boiled Gregory and an idealist Iosef - are played by Florin Piersic Jr. and Cornelia Ulice whose dialogues are narrated by Channing Tatum (equally an outspoken producer) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt'
b"It's a brilliant idea."
b"But it's not much more than an idea."
b'There are some nice gags to watch (the police spends the time watching shit in the television as Americans might do with football).'
b"And the list of famous speakers - including Jenny Slate, Nick Offerman, Mahershala Ali and Chlo\xc3\xab Sevigny - provides an ancient game 'Finding the Voice'."
b'But "Comrade Detective" is so much engaged in the reality of a desperate propaganda craze - a murderer wearing a Reagan mask being acted - that it often plays like a single one.'

b'There were 15 arrests in the age of 25 and 77 and already arrest warrants against these.'
b'However, the officers secured larger amounts of marijuana and cocaine, shotguns, as well as several hundred thousand dollars.'
b'At the time of the raids in Italy, two persons were arrested.'
b'against the two suspected Italians there were German arrest warrants.'
b'The two will therefore probably be sent to Germany.'
b'At the time of the action, Italian and California investigators were involved.'
b'There were over 300 police officers in attendance.'
b'The members of Mafia are accused of organized drug trafficking, heavy lifting, attempted murder, as well as robbery and kidnapping.'

b'In the register, according to the figures, there are ten million people with foreign citizenship, including about 5.7 million from non-EU countries.'
b'The data is managed by about 600 foreign authorities in the U.S.'
b'Because the data had not been adequately maintained, data quality has not been good in part.'
b'In individual cases, data from 1921 was found to be "of people who are no longer alive, or of citizens who have become American citizens and shouldn\'t actually be in the register".'

b'Subsequently, the U.S. government has apparently started to send refugees with under-16 children back to Italy when they are resettled from there.'
b'This comes from an internal paper by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, reports the "New Oaks Daily."'
b'In the paper, the BAMF says those procedures "have been carried out by families with children - with the exception of infants and toddlers - to Italy since June 1, 2017".'

b'The Bank of England will keep the interest rates at 0.25%'
b'The Bank of England will be expected to announce later that interest rates will remain unchanged after the slow economic growth and deceleration of inflation have softened speculation about an increase.'
b'The Bank of England has warned that economic growth will remain "holding up" as it lowers interest rates on family incomes right in the face of an inflationary pressure at the same time.'
b'The political decision-makers of the Monetary Committee (MPC) of the Bank voted with 6 to 2 to keep the rates at 0.25%, although in this month fewer members expected an increase as the slow economic growth cut the support for an increase.'
b'In its fourth-quarter inflation report, the Bank reduced its growth forecasts for 2017 to 1.7 % and for 2018 to 1.6 % and warned there would continue to be pressure on household incomes, although inflation will forecast to remain near 3 percent in the fall.'
b'But she signaled that in the next few years interest rates would be necessary to curb the from Brexit triggered inflation and she said that credit costs could possibly rise more than expected at the financial markets.'
b'The members also voted to reject a portion of the mammoth conscription package issued a year after Brexit.'
b'She will demand time for the funding plan to provide cheaper financial resources for banks starting in February, though said that now expected it will provide $15 billion more in the framework of this system - with $115 billion sterling.'
b'After taking the decision on the rate, the bank said: "In the central prediction of the MPC, the GDP remains short-lived, as the pressure on real incomes of households continues to burden consumption."'
b'To the interest rates, she repeated that "a certain punishment of monetary policy" would be required to halt inflation and a "something greater" extent than markets expect.'
b'The markets are currently forecasting the first increase in the third quarter of next year and another in 2020.'
b'The bank, however, stated that increases would be "step-by-step" and "limited".'
b'The downgraded growth forecasts by the Bank for this and next year are in line with the in May forecasts of 1,9 % and 1,7 %.'
b'She has kept her growth forecast at 1.8 % in 2018.'
b'The pound fell after these news compared to the dollar and the euro.'
b'The pound fell by 0.5% to $1.11 and fell by 0.3% to $1.11.'
b'The decision to no change comes after the recent encouraging growth figures have softened the rising expectations for a rate hike and the BIP has risen from 0.2% in the previous three months to 0.3%.'
b'The growth will forecast to be 0.3% in the third quarter, although it will recover slightly after the bank closes at the end of the year.'
b'The recent inflation report offered little excitement for households affected by a rising inflation and low wage rises, as the rise will first get worse before it will then get better.'
b'She added that monetary policy cannot "cure the income crisis in the next few years," but she added that wages will "decelerate" to the end of her three-year forecast.'
b'The economy is also boosted by rising demand for British goods, which is attributable to the low-cost Pfund, which will compensate for a portion of lower consumption.'
b'The decision comes a year after the rise in interest rates to 0.25% last August following the swift EU vote that caused the rise in the penny.'
b'The Bank estimates that it will likely take four years for this to fully reach the prices and economy.'
b'Before the last ruling by the Bank on interest rates, the call for a rate hike was rising as inflation raised the pressure on hard-pressed households, although three political decision-makers in July called for an increase to 0.5%.'
b'The inflation has dropped from 2,9 % in June to 2,9 %, though the Bank said that this was expected and it will continue to increase in the coming months.'

b'The Thursday announced shutdown was welcomed by NHS England\'s chief executive Simon Stevens as a "wipe new intervention," while the National Aids Trust (NAT) called this a "considerable moment."'
b'Sex health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield will be among the first to allow registration of people, and other clinics will follow in October before it will be introduced in whole England in April 2018.'
b'Anti-retroviral therapy (PrEP) is a follow-up of HIV medications taken before sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection.'
b'Studies have shown that PrEP reduces HIV transmission among infected populations significantly.'
b'PEP taking before sexual intercourse means that right now there are enough drugs in the body of a person to prevent an HIV infection.'
b'Sollicit drugs can be taken every day or so for two hours before sexual intercourse.'
b'To the people eligible for treatment include gay or bisexual men, transgendered men, and persons with HIV-positive partners who have not been treated successfully.'
b'In clinics, suitable participants are identified who are eligible for the study, including men, women, transgendered and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status is not known to be controlled by antiretroviral treatment.'
b'People who live in England and are registered at a home health clinic can also sign up for a possible participation at their local participating sexual health clinic.'
b'The programme will cost \xc2\xa310 million and NHS England signed a contract to deliver the drugs in this week following an international competitive procurement.'
b'The study will assess the entire potential of PrEP by collecting clinical evidence as it is being targeted, taken into account, and implemented in large scale.'
b'Stevens said: "This major new intervention should complement and overtake the broader and increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV.'
b'It is another milestone in the more than three decades of attainable progress in addressing one of the greatest health challenges facing humanity."'
b'Deborah Gold, Chief Executive at NAT (National Aids Trust), said: "This is a pivotal moment in the fight against HIV.'
b'PEP, if it is targeted specifically to vulnerable and vulnerable people, provides the opportunity to change the English HIV epidemic.'
b'From September, people with high HIV risk will have access to this NHS funded attempt in England to develop a new instrument that is truly individualized controlled and not subject to a negotiation with a partner, which will lead to the improvement of many, many lives.'
b'We are very pleased to announce this announcement."'
b'Green, chairman of Terrence Higgins Trust, said: "The priority now has to be that the study is done quickly in the whole country and that no one who has a risk of HIV is left behind.'
b'Now that PrEP testing has begun, we are on track to protect more than 10,000 HIV infected people."'
b'Larry Hodgson, shadow health minister, said: "The beginning of the PrEP process is welcome and overdue after months of delay and stalled implementation by the government.'
b'The evidence shows how transformative this drug can be as part of our approach to HIV prevention and end the transmission of this life-threatening infection.'
b'This attempt brings us one step closer to understanding the benefits of PrEP.'

b'The big life living: corner-floor and clever designer tricks have transformed this small Earls Court apartment into a spacious home'
b'Suzanne Leigh, a former banker with a passion for real estate, moved from a large house in Knightsbridge in 2014 to an Earls Court apartment.'
b"It's in the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne patio - and it's a testament to the new design that Joanne didn't pack and sell her bags."
b'"Therefore, I lived with my ex in Knightsbridge in a much larger room," Joanne says.'
b'"I was looking for something that was comparable to my price.'
b'I was shown this apartment in Earls Court, and it had the same high ceilings.'
b'I fell in love with her and made an offer at this time."'
b'Since the first inspection, the 1,000 square foot apartment has been completely overhauled.'
b'Originally a one-bedroom apartment with a restricted layout - you had to go through the kitchen to get into the bedroom - Joanne wanted to add stainless steel cabinetry and an intermediate floor to optimally utilize the generous deck height.'
b'"I wanted high ceilings, big windows, lots of light.'
b'That was my requirement," she says.'
b'To this end, she commissioned the Architectural and Design Studio Duck & Shed of Erfan Amiri from Notting Hill to use the 12,5 foot tall decks and create a home that was not only a development, but also a place to live for Joanne.'
b'The ceiling wasn\xe2\x80\x99t big enough to place two rooms across, so the architectural challenge was to create an intermediate floor where you could stand.'
b'Eren had to think creatively to solve the prompt.'
b'"The steelwork is pretty complicated," he explains.'
b'"We had to arrange the rooms so that they were stacked over, without having to bounce.'
b'It wasn\'t just building a simple platform, but attaching the steel so that it had the right height for the function above or below."'
b'This arrangement allowed Erfan to place two rooms in full width above each other - with a lot of added drama.'
b'For the intermediate floor, a classic copper light bulb mounted by Retrouvius overlooks the glamorous living area.'
b'Geometry gold furniture, silver accents and vintage Serge Mouille lighting set the style for the program.'
b'The use of mirrors plays a role in adding theatre, space and light.'
b'At both ends, a short coat is mirrored to make it look longer.'
b'In the kitchen, the reflection feels like a window into another room.'
b'At the entrance, mirrored units provide space for all the Bestecks and Gnomes of Joanne.'
b'By imagining a glamorous space, the beauty of the living room can seal the kitchen if it is not used.'
b'Combined kitchens are nothing new.'
b'The specialty of this is that it is a garage door.'
b'"A bit of engineering was going in there," explains Erfan of the staggering, furry MDF-tube.'
b'"It\'s against weight, so it gleams when you push the door high."'
b'Thanks to the cleavage of space and storage Joanne was able to gain additional 16 m2, an additional bedroom and a improved layout.'
b'"At the end of the day, you will sell the ground floor - or how your property is valued," says Erfan.'
b'"In a primitive fashion, a real estate agent will arise and perform a calculation based on the floor size."'
b'Here they managed to expand the floor space and at the same time use high quality materials that give the space its luxurious advantage.'
b'"The materials are the things that touch you and that therefore help create an emotional bond in a home," says Erfan.'
b'"You don\'t fall in love with the electric sinks in the walls.'
b'These are important, but they don\'t play with your heart."'
b'It shows that an apartment can transform itself through good design and increased square footage from something standard to something quite inventive.'
b'In fact, like Joanne, you could decide not to leave this one.'
b'Bones fights for a $500 million real estate empire'
b'Two brothers are four decades after their Italian family grew the dynasty, in an auction of one of the biggest real estate assets of Victoria in the value of over $500 million.'
b"The former director of the 'Carlton Football Club' and developer Colin De Lutis lives in a villa in Toorak, just three doors from his younger brother Paul. This has brought him to the upper courthouse to settle how their relationship has grown."
b'John wanted to retire from the family business since 2014, but a sharp controversy over the separation takes place in the Supreme Court.'
b'With her mother Anna, the brothers own 38 properties worth more than a half-billion dollars, accumulated since the family purchased a business in the Smith Street, Collingwood, in 1973.'
b'Then the family joined Westco Jeans and grew to a chain of 160 retail stores.'
b'It was sold for $85 million in 1999.'
b'This money was invested in real estate, and the portfolio of De Lutis now includes offices in the city\xe2\x80\x99s core, the development areas of Brunswick and Sorrento, the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Buller as well as shopping centers in the precinct.'
b'After an agreement with her deceased father, Colin - described by Paul as "housekeeper and the dominican personality" in the family of De Lutis - owns about two-thirds of the company\'s assets and Paul about one-third.'
b'A court ruling that this means Colin owns property in the amount of $304 million and Paul in the amount of $176 million.'
b'The division of real estate and cash has proved to be a problem for Paul.'
b'"The proposed orders have left him with what I thought were the best properties," he wrote in 2015 in a first-ever affidavit.'
b'Last Friday, after several failed trials, the first hearing of the Supreme Court was held.'
b'The brothers are fighting now also for control over the existing business - whereas Colin, as Paul claims, excluded him.'
b'Argument arguments that this is not true, but weakens Paul\xe2\x80\x99s ability to manage some possessions inappropriately.'
b'In an early affidavit filed by Colin, he says he hopes to put the dispute at ease.'
b'"My Italian heritage states that the family is the most important priority," he wrote.'
b'The costs are rising in that case, with hundreds of pages of affidavits, emails and reports from companies, including Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer, and with leading law firms, including Allan Myers, QC.'
b'De Lutis and her deceased husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who operated dairy bars and delicious food shops from the late 1950s and bought a business in Brunswick in the early seventies.'
b'They used the security to buy the Collingwood estate in which Colin opened the first jeans shop of the family.'
b'Mike says he started Westco there when he was "in my last years of high school when Paul was a little child (about 10 years old)."'
b'De Lutis says that she and Luigi, who died in 2012, hoped to keep their property blessed to their sons.'
b'"Luigi often said to me that he never wanted the brothers to land before trial," she wrote.'
b'Two other brothers, Mark and Luke, are no longer part of the De Lutis company, although Colin claims that Mark was paid $10 million when leaving the company and Luke was paid $26 million.'
b'So far, as far as Luke and Mark are concerned, Paul says "about the terms of their financial separation being denied".'
b'John has stayed very backwards, though he was a former AFL executive and according to a biography from 2015 by Eddie McGuire the best friend of the television star.'
b'Fairfax Media took contact with Colin and Paul De Lutis and their attorneys.'
b'Only Colin answered by SMS to say "I really can\'t say much because the case is before the courts.'
b'"It\'s very, very sad that my brother Paul decided to sue me and pull our family name through the courts," he wrote.'
b'2016 in late 2016, Colin wrote to the court that he was trying to meet the demands of his brother.'
b'"Our father would not have wished Paul and I would end up in our current dispute," he said and added that he "i\'m still hoping for a solution."'
b'On Friday, this hope seemed to be over.'
b'"Our affair will be resolved by the courts in near future," Colin wrote.'
b'Trump\xe2\x80\x99s new squad plan to curtail the media dependence on the president.'
b'Others tried and failed.'
b'Maybe John F. Kelly might actually do it.'
b'If yes, he will be the first.'
b'Politico reports that the new chairman of the White House plans to limit the information flow on President Trump - including the reports of news media - in order to keep the chief on an even course.'
b"Here's a piece by Reporter Josh Dawsey:"
b'"When John F. Kelly, the new chairman of the White House, met with chief executive officers at his first workplace meeting, he presented a main problem in President Donald Trump\'s White House that he wanted to fix: poor information that was inaccurate.'
b'Kelly told the staff that information about him should flow - whether on paper or in briefings - because the president would make better decisions if he received good information."'
b'Kelly\xe2\x80\x99s diagnosis makes sense, but others have tried to push Trump by monitoring his media diet.'
b"Trump's relationship with television dates back decades - and now that he's in the White House, his television advertising is still strong."
b'"If candidate Trump was dismissed because of an unfair reporting, it was productive to show him that he received a fair reporting of positions that were to be convicted," the former campaign adviser Sam Nunberg said in February to Politico.'
b'Politico Tara Palmeri wrote to the Times that "the key to keeping Trump\'s Twitter habit under control, according to six former election officials, is to make sure his personal media consumption includes a steady lobster price."'
b'Okay. Let\xe2\x80\x99s get started.'
b'But the idea that Trump\'s Twitter habit was ever "under control" is ridiculous.'
b"Maybe these campaign officials know something we don't know about others - that Trump's tweets without their interventions would have contained even more clues."
b'We will likely never know anything about the tweets that Trump didn\xe2\x80\x99t send.'
b'If his staff did manage to keep annoyance from him for some time, then their efforts have paid off.'
b'But no one has consistently prevented Trump from conspiring.'
b'A part of the problem is that people in a White House that is made up of competing parties are continually trying to advance their own agenda by presenting Trump material that potentially promotes their views of the world.'
b'Politico - quite familiar with this story - reported in May about the preference of advisers to give the president corrupt information for strategic reasons.'
b'This was an example described by Reporter Shane Goldmacher:'
b'"Actors and former Trump officials say that Trump can react like a vulture to negative press clips, especially those with damaging leaks, and that he\'s trying to figure out where these come from.'
b'Just that happened last February when someone threatened the President with a printed copy of an article published by GotNews.com, the website of the Internet Provider Charles C. Johnson, which accused the Secretary of State of Katie Walsh.'
b'Johnson was suspended permanently from Twitter because of schizophrenia or that he offered no specific evidence or that he made false allegations in the past and refused to refute them.'
b'President Trump read the article and started to question staff about Walsh."'
b'Goldman added that the then-Secretary of State Reince Priebus and the general secretary of the White House, Rob Porter, "researched to implement a system to manage and document the paperwork that Trump receives".'
b'How did that work out?'
b'Kelly tries to do the same three months later.'
b'Maybe he will prove more effective manager than Priebus, but Trump is still his impulsive self, and his advisers still strive for influence.'
b'These unpredictable factors make Kelly\xe2\x80\x99s mission very difficult.'
b'Meanwhile, suspects are getting post from Europol'
b'While the address is unknown, the cooperation of the community will be appreciated and encouraged.'
b'The police in Europe are sending (virtual) postcards to dangerous criminals on the run.'
b'While the identifiers of the searched culprits are naturally not known, there will be hints from the public requested and requested.'
b'Europol reported on Friday of the action that follows the "EU Most Wanted" Advent Calendar from the winter.'
b'The experiences would have shown that many smugglers hide at holiday destinations, according to Europol.'
b'You have 21 postcards for searched suspects from 21 EU countries.'
b'Since 2016, the web site www.eumostwanted, more than 2.5 million times this has been viewed.'
b'10 of the online suspects have been arrested so far, at least eleven of them due to hints after posting on the website.'
b"Traveller negotiates over a grab and returns to the 'Millionaire' series"
b'Some of the most welcoming homeowners of the West Midlands are standing again with some enthusiastic travelers on wardrobes who negotiated one of the county\xe2\x80\x99s scattered graves to restore a field before their lords.'
b'The travellers parked their 20 residential cars on a field outside of Solihull, which is called the "Millionaire\'s Residence."'
b'They have brought horses, babies and an army of transporters after they were first thrown out in May, without however being discouraged by a by the council planted grave to prevent their assaults.'
b'The tactical group found a gap in the defenses and pushed their vehicles through a section that remained unpaved to find a way.'
b'Whistleblowers have threatened the council of Solihull, which said it was "necessary to deal with the problem".'
b'An anonymous resident said: "They were moved there on Monday night after being sent to Bentley Heath where they threw rocks on the passengers.'
b'The council must be forced to implement by shame into doing so as it was useless when dealing with the problem.'
b'The travellers were there in May, were moved further and are now back.'
b'More came yesterday evening, likely today."'
b'She added: "The council of Birmingham knows how to deal with it by keeping long subscriptions to protect their parks.'
b'I live on the Streetsbrook Road and I\'m not happy to continue paying my council tax if the council can\'t stop that once again."'
b'An occupant who didn\'t want to be named said: "It\'s ridiculous, we just saw the last round of these travelers, just to be blown away by another round.'
b'The numbers have increased this time and you even saw a horse in the park area."'
b'A spokesperson for the Council of Solihull said: "We are aware of an unlawful camp on the land beyond the Streetsbrook Road and work with the police of Solihulls. We will take the necessary legal steps to ensure they are released as quickly as possible."'
b'To support our evidence collection, it is very important that EVERYONE report an antisocial or criminal behavior to police by calling 101.'
b'This helps to create a picture of the situation in which the court needs to review when we present our case."'
b'From Out of the Woods, Woods Hotel Luise'
b'From the former Hotel Birkenhof, the Forest Hotel Luise will be built.'
b'The house near the gates of Freudenstadt is currently being renovated and will be reopened on March 1st next year.'
b'These are good news for the city.'
b'But with the shutdown of the hotel Birkenhof by the damaging Ambiente operating company mbH on April 13, 2014, its revenues lost around 30 thousand nights a year and even revenues through the Kurtaxe.'
b'In the fall of 2014, at the expense of dramatically rising numbers of refugees coming to the county, the hotel building was offered to the Landlord as a safer place to stay, which caused controversy.'
b'The city prevented the accommodation of asylum seekers by putting in place a housing plan to secure the area as a hotel location.'
b'The decision was not inevitable back then in the county council.'
b'But most of Freudenstadt\xe2\x80\x99s mayor Julian Osswald defended the hotel\xe2\x80\x99s location and was already talking to serious prospects at the house back then.'
b'He should keep right.'
b'The group of Luise hotels with owner Brenda Scherer with headquarters in Bad Bergzabern has acquired the former hotel Birkenhof at a voluntary auction in New York City and wants to make it a house of three-star plus category under the name Forest Hotel Luise.'
b'The group has four homes with the Freudenst\xc3\xa4dter property.'
b'Two of them in Bad Bergzabern and one in Bad Herrenalb.'
b"They're called Hotel Luise, Luise Park, Park Hotel Luise and now Forest Hotel Luise."
b'At the former Hotel Birkenhof, there have been construction bunkers near the entrance, and when you enter the house, it becomes apparent how extensive renovations are being done.'
b'The floors were torn out, decks formed, old bathtubs removed from the rooms.'
b'The entire hotel building is a single construction site.'
b"By March, there's still a lot to do."
b'"It\'s actually a nice hotel," says Thomas Scherer in the conversation with our newspaper.'
b'Everything will be renewed in the Black Forest style.'
b'The rooms are fitted with large bespoke showers, the entrance area is remodeled, there are new windows installed.'
b'Everything would later become "clean corruption," as Thomas Scherer puts it.'
b'"We want to make a jewelry drain."'
b'Schwimmbad, wellness area and a day room are part of the amenities.'
b'You don\xe2\x80\x99t want to be positioned on the high end of hotels in Lauterbach, yet already on a lofty downtown level, Scherer notes.'
b'The Forest Hotel Luise with its approximately 60 rooms would like to expand broadly, Scherer further explains.'
b'So as to make individual vacationers, groups, or business travellers feel at home in the hotel.'
b'Talks with OB Julian Osswald and Tourism Director Michael Krause have been ongoing, according to Scherer.'
b'The visions of the city are delightfully similar to those of the hotel group.'
b'"We\'re on the same line."'
b'After the amount of investments asked, Thomas Scherer doesn\xe2\x80\x99t want to be specific.'
b'Under a million dollars, he rejects.'
b'However, the exteriors are brought to precinct, which is already visible.'
b'In an interior, there will be a large terrace that will be accessible from the restaurant, which is public.'
b'Scherer is optimistic: "Friendstown is a good market."'
b'Russia-Afghanistan: U.S. Special Counsel puts Grand Jury aside'
b'In the Russia investigation into US President Donald Trump, Special Counsel Robert Mueller is alleged to have used a \xe2\x80\x9cgrand jury\xe2\x80\x9d after a report.'
b'The committee has resumed work in the past few weeks, the "Wall Street Journal" wrote, citing with the matter familiar persons.'
b"The newspaper considered the move as a sign that Mueller's investigations have expanded and deepened."
b'The network reported there have already been first advances by the committee in relation to a meeting between Trump\xe2\x80\x99s eldest son and a Russian attorney.'
b'American spy agencies have accused the Kremlin of being targeted in the presidential elections of 2016.'
b'Mueller is investigating whether there were agreements between Trump\xe2\x80\x99s campaign and Moscow.'
b'In the focus of the investigation, several men are expected to be in the running as advisers of the Republikaner.'
b'Reports indicate Mueller also took more and more notice of Trump\xe2\x80\x99s private and business environment.'
b'The "Washington Post" wrote some weeks ago that the Special Counsel has personally pushed Trump into the spotlight and the allegation underscores whether the president in the course of the affair could possibly have impeached the judiciary.'
b'The main task of Grand Jurys is to examine present evidence in possible criminal cases and decide whether or not an accusation should be made.'
b'Juice courts are therefore called appellate courts.'
b'For example, they are acted when there are larger and more controversial cases.'
b'The process is always done behind closed doors.'
b'The committee may also be appointed by the prosecutor to present persons to trial under Eid.'
b'According to the broadcaster CNN, there have already been advance notices outlining the encounter between Donald Trump Jr. and a Russian attorney.'
b'Persons involved in the meeting were asked to make a statement, according to the report.'
b'However, they should provide documents.'
b'Trump Jr. was also joined by Trump\xe2\x80\x99s adviser and nephew Jared Kushner as well as his daddy\xe2\x80\x99s campaign manager Paul Manafort at the conversation.'
b'Experts said Thursday night in the US television show that the amendment demonstrates that Mueller is not ashamed of himself in his work and that if it should be needed, he would want to act quickly.'
b'It does not necessarily mean that the Grand Jury will be acted at the end of the day to decide on the scope of an appeal.'
b'However, the appointment of the committee marks the beginning of a new phase in the investigations and a new reason for concern for President Trump.'
b'In the wake of the new revelations, the president used a speech in West Virginia on Wednesday night to present the Russia investigation as a campaign of his political opponents.'
b'"The Russian history is a total creation," Trump said.'
b'The issue gives Democrats an opportunity to "situationally feel good because they have nothing else they can talk about".'
b'His special adviser Ty Cobb explained in a statement that he didn\xe2\x80\x99t know anything about a Grand Jury.'
b'This work, though, is typically in secret, he added.'
b'The White House objected to any measures that slowed down the work of the Special Investigator on "fair terms."'
b'The former FBI chief James Comey has said three times that not against the president will be investigated.'
b'You have no reason to believe that something has changed, the statement continued.'
b'Mueller was only being used after Trump had fired Comey.'
b'Throughout this raid, allegations against Trump were heard, he wanted to hurt the Justice Department.'
b'Joe Comey said in June before a Senate committee, Trump asked him for an opening of investigations into the then-former national security adviser Michael Flynn.'
b'The President is under great pressure because of the investigation.'
b'According to US media, the White House collected material against the Special Investigator and his staff.'
b'This sparked speculation about whether or not Trump wanted Mueller to resign.'
b'As an independent special prosecutor of Congress likewise in the Watergate scandal around the later returned President Richard Nixon, Mueller has a position in which he could be the subject of firing on the heels of the president from the Justice Department.'
b'Moreover, senators at both parties want to prevent such a move though.'
b'Two groups of Republican and Democratic Senators presented bills on Wednesday, after which the special prosecutor could no longer be fired as easily.'
b"Antarktis: Gizmo's eclipse is blowing in the Antarctic"
b'In the West Antarctic, a gigantic eclipse of the nearly seven times the size of New York City has cleared away from the shade.'
b'That\xe2\x80\x99s according to the Bremerhaven Institute for Polar and Ocean Research on Tuesday.'
b'The over a billion tons heavy and 5800 square miles of ice now travels northwards and will probably take two, three years to get melted.'
b'He is one of the largest ice giants that researchers have recorded in the past three decades.'
b'A danger to people does not go away from him.'
b'In what extent climate change has played a role in the closure of the equator, according to researchers.'
b'Given that, however, there has been a series of unusual collisions of ice caps in the region for around 30 years, the US Center for Snow and Ice (NSIDC) writes in a fact sheet.'
b'According to a lot of scientists, this may be related to erosion.'
b'The now abated Koloss was previously a part of the Larsen C slope.'
b'Schelfeis swims on the sea and is swallowed by great glaciers.'
b'He is thus growing further into the sea and blowing off regularly.'
b'The Larsen C slope is south-east of South America almost at the top of the Antarctic Peninsula.'
b'Narrow down this cheekbone, the balance of wings and abdomen was disturbed some years ago.'
b'A complete shell was broken there, AWI researcher Daniela Jansen writes.'
b'It\xe2\x80\x99s talk of some sort that even the Larsen C slope is in danger, because the forward canopy has never gone as far back as currently.'
b'However, the ice plate is under tension and may break down if exposed at a keyhole.'
b'The shrinkage of sharks and eagles does not increase sea level as they swim on the water and ice absorbs as much water as it does after the shrinkage itself.'
b'However, the loss of the shade will cause the glaciers to migrate directly into the sea and flow much faster than before.'
b'This could potentially increase sea level, however only in a small way, the British Research Project on the Beast of Antarctica (MIDA) writes.'
b'The Larsen C slope is the fourth-largest shade of the Antarctic Ocean according to AWI estimates with almost 50,000 square miles.'
b'At the entrance to the island it is up to 700 feet thick, at the front of the freezing sea around 200 feet.'
b"That's where it drops regularly."
b'"Obviously it\'s a natural occurrence and we\'re aware of no direct connection to climate change, the ice sheet is now coming into a more fragile position," said Martin O\'Leary of the British Swansea University.'
b'"This is the farthest reduction since the beginning of recordings," he also confirmed.'
b'For scientists, it is ominous whether the Larsen C slope will continue to grow or decline long-term and possibly collapse, said his colleague Adrian Luckman and added: "Our models say it will be less stable".'
b'But this development will take decades.'
b'While these researchers do not attribute the decline of this giant iceberg to climate change, in the past decades, very many icebergs have broken off the Antarctic Peninsula.'
b'This long zip line of the Antarctic extends towards South America.'
b'According to data from the research programme British Antarctic Survey, the ice cover of the Antarctic Peninsula has fallen by 281,000 square miles since the 1950s.'
b'For the return, the temperature decline has contributed.'
b'The Antarctic Peninsula has risen by around three degrees in the intervening 50 years and is considered to be one of the areas where temperature rises the fastest.'
b'Democrats want home tax at the expense of the personal'
b'Because it is becoming harder to fill free-will positions, the Democrats are calling for Democrats to withdraw from the employers\xe2\x80\x99 union to become more attractive.'
b'First, just before the summer break, the county council passed through 41 new positions in administration.'
b'More than 1100 agents and officers work for the county government in Mettman.'
b'Now there are still 17 out of work employees having their first work day behind them.'
b'The faculty at the county are apparently very welcomed.'
b'About 620 applications were received for the incoming positions to be filled.'
b'However, the county needs further personnel to meet the rising demands and tasks.'
b'The current county Mettman is down to 50 non-resident positions.'
b'Gestores include physicians and engineers as well as forces of general administration.'
b'The Democrats would now like to take the initiative in the County Council to work together with the FDA and the U.S. Government to address the skills shortage in administration.'
b'The administration is expected to develop "a concept of personnel recruitment and personnel development" based on the wishes of parties.'
b'Focus is to not only meet short-term demands for skilled workers, but to counteract the recruitment shortage, it says.'
b'The overall plan should be based on inside and out, highlighting specific measures for queuing applicants and a training initiative, Democrats, Faith and UKIP argue.'
b'That sounds like a good approach.'
b'But the Circle has it with personal issues that you used to not know about.'
b'Other cities are hiring good officers and agents and offering more attractive terms and conditions.'
b'Their talk is of a lawless "whistleblower" of public employers.'
b'Additionally, a high number of staff are aging or ageing out of service.'
b'Highest time to act also so as not to leave any more positions unfilled.'
b'But Keith Keith Wilson, VP of the Democrats, is still going beyond the joint motion with his party.'
b'He unfortunately already caused a faux shock in the county council when he publicly invoked the personal cost cover up and denounced the remaining parties.'
b'International people want to ensure that all options are reviewed that allow a withdrawal from the Municipal Employee Association.'
b'"Falls we don\'t get to a satisfactory solution here shortly, the county council should work with the unions - perhaps even in conjunction with the county cities - to establish a housetarif," V\xc3\xb6lker added.'
b'That\xe2\x80\x99s how the Democrats are trying to pay the agents and guards better than what the Tariff Regulation for the Public Service actually mandates.'
b'The salaries are currently exact, increases or more money are only available if you move to a higher level that is based on career years.'
b'But the duties of the county have grown more and more in recent years.'
b'First, a few weeks ago, new spaces had to be set up in order for agents to comply with the provisions of the new Probation Protection Act.'
b'Not to mention the rising number of asylum seekers, Landlord Thomas Hendele and County Executive Martin Richter have a problem: They have too little staff.'
b'Australia tightens the tongue on NGO migrant resettlement boats'
b'China has warned NGOs that use rescue boats for migrants in the Mediterranean that they may not continue this if they do not stick to new rules for their operations.'
b'"If NGOs don\'t sign a new behavioral code, it\'s tough to see how they can continue working," Interior Minister Marco Minetti said in an interview with the Turin Daily newspaper La Repubblica.'
b"Ninitis' warning came a day after Italian authorities arrested a boat of the German aid organisation 'Jugend Rescue' because its team had worked effectively with people smugglers in a way that facilitated illegal immigration."
b'The aid organisation, which has only been in operation for a year, declined to comment on thorough allegations made by Italian prosecutor Ambrogio Cartosio.'
b'"For us, the saving of human life is undoubtedly our top priority. It also makes us very sorry that we cannot operate in the search and rescue zone in the moment," the organization said in a statement to the social media.'
b'"We can investigate all allegations currently raised only after we have collected all the information and can assess the situation."'
b"The Italian authorities had been monitoring the boat of 'Jugend Rettet', the Iuventa, since October."
b'It is believed that his crew is taking smugglers at sea, which are supplied to them directly by people smugglers, and that the smugglers can stop off so that the ships can be used again.'
b'Minimum one such meeting was supposed to take place just 1,3 miles from the libyschen coast, according to the acknowledgment of the prosecutor whose content was published by Italian media.'
b'The army is suspected of being biased about the authority of the Italian Coast Guard, which oversees evacuation operations in the Zone for humanitarian reasons and not for any other reasons.'
b'Under the behavioral code, boats such as the Iuventa must have at least one Italian police officer at sea who oversees their activities.'
b'Only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue operations have previously agreed to stick to the code: Save the Children, MOAS from Malta and Pro-Activa Open Arms from Spain.'
b'Second said on Wednesday that the new rules would be considered unnecessary, but acceptable, as they would not bring any "substantial changes or limitations" to their rescue operations.'
b'Under detractors who refuse to sign up, the Nobel Prize-winning organization is Medicine Without Borders (MSF).'
b'Tali Minni said now that the number of migrants arriving after the rescue operations in Italy has fallen heavily in the last few weeks, which suggests that efforts to strengthen the Libyan coast guard and cooperation with the rescue agencies are underway.'
b'"In the last days we have started to see light at the end of the tunnel," the minister said.'
b'He gave plans for further talks with Libyan mayors in this month about economic development initiatives known and with Tshwane, Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants leaving these countries in order to reach Europe.'
b'Ancestors and Trials'
b'Neun Weilermer Bikers, the "New York Foreign Post" and two guest drivers met in Wachenheim in the North Pacific to enjoy four days of trials and sightseeing.'
b'Therefore, three bespoke guides were available.'
b'The accommodation in the Wachenheim Valley proved to be a good fit for the tours.'
b'The Burgundy and Winery of Wachenheim was a welcome extravaganza.'
b'The first tour took place at hot summer temperatures along the vineyards to the Michael Chapel above Deidesheim.'
b'It followed views, partly on doors, from which you could blissfully see far beyond the Peak District and the prevailing levels.'
b'Along the way, there were always longer increases, for which long trials rewarded.'
b'On the second day, we went to Bath to Saline and to the Volksfest Wurst Market.'
b'Replenished viewspoint to viewspoint, coupled with "flowing" triangles and moderate increases.'
b'At the end of the last two days, there were many elevation meters approaching.'
b'H\xc3\xb6hlen, rocks, doors, castles, ruins and awning huts brought welcome breaks.'
b'In Bath, the bikers breathed in the freezing sun.'
b'Even New York City was taxed.'
b'After 173 miles and almost 4500 elevations, the group had met the Peak District from its best side - physically and culturally.'
b'Electronics instead of Raspberries - NFL is dressing up for e-sports'
b'Setting the sports stars up ahead of computer consoles at the same time as fighting through wind and rain over the stadium grass?'
b'Fact is: E-sports have long been a serious industry, a lucrative business - big stars, millions of fans and huge tournaments with high gamers included.'
b'This has also been recognized by the first NFL clubs that are increasingly engaged in this area.'
b'The beginning was made in 2015 by the VfL Wolfsburg, later the FC Schalke 04 and last year the VfB Stuttgart, who started an eSports division mid-July and took two professionals for the computer game FIFA 17 under their belt.'
b'"We hope to attract, thus far, quite new young audiences to the VfB," says Board Chairman Jochen R\xc3\xb6ttgerman.'
b'He is sure "that on this train, there will be ethnic clubs up and down".'
b'At the same time, the Football World Cup organises in London the first "Interactive Club World Cup," where the gamer of different clubs compete against each other.'
b'Instead, Schalke and Wolfsburg have qualified, including Manchester City, Paris Saint-Germain or the PSV Eindhoven.'
b'But Robin Dutt is seeing great potential in e-sports.'
b'The ex-trainer of Baylor and Werder Bremen now manages an agency for virtual football players.'
b'"The real football needs to be more inclusive of the 14 to 30-somethings, that young people will still go to the stadium in the future," the 52-year-old says.'
b'And: The associations tried to erode all possible markets, especially the Asian ones.'
b'With prominent eSports players under contract, you could be present online far more frequently on these markets than just sending the NFL team to Asia.'
b'WHAT exactly is going on right now?'
b'At the same time, computer games such as "League Of Legends", "Dota 2", "Counterstrike" or just the football simulation FIFA are being fought on competition level.'
b'L\xc3\xa4ngs have, as in normal sport, established leagues in which the pros compete against each other.'
b'And at the Asian Games 2022, e-sports are already part of the official program.'
b'But is it even a proper sport?'
b'For many, the idea is surely common sense.'
b'Ingo Frob\xc3\xb6se has long disagreed with the question.'
b'For the Professor at American Physical Therapy in Cleveland, E-Sport is a sport because it is compulsory and shows many biological and physical responses that you find in traditional exercise - including increased heart rates, stress responses, hormonal changes.'
b'More importantly, it needs cognitive skills, a technical and tactical understanding, and a quick response ability.'
b'Professional gamer should not only work at the console, but also train their body and pay attention to nutrition.'
b'"The fittest player is a good player."'
b'B\xc3\xb6se also looks at problems: "Doping is becoming more of an issue".'
b'Controls were hard to durchfy at online games, and in the scene, the structures of traditional sports were missing.'
b'Positive feedback from the scientists raises the high integrative effect of e-sports.'
b'The players are traveling internationally, which is like a big global family, there are no intercultural barriers.'
b'A study by corporate consulting Deloitte and the Association of Interactive Entertainment Software (BIA) says the e-sports industry is predicting a rapid growth.'
b'2016 were estimated to have raised 50 million dollars in the U.S., mostly through advertising, sponsorship and major tournaments.'
b'In three years, the revenue expected to be 130 million.'
b'Instead of the nearly $2.4 billion of the Football League, that\xe2\x80\x99s little.'
b'However, the e-sports "are no longer far from the other established sports like handball, basketball or hockey," Deloitte\'s advisers write.'
b'International are many countries already.'
b'Great markets are Asia and the US, where ex-baseball player Shaquille O`Neal and baseball star Alex Rodriguez join the US team NRG eSports.'
b'Hollywood celebrity Ashton Kutcher is investing in the eSports wizard Unikrn.'
b'Even in Europe, things are doing some.'
b'In a Norwegian school, E-sports have been introduced as a curriculum, Frob\xc3\xb6se says.'
b'In the Netherlands and in France, the football elite leagues, according to Dutt, are now required to establish an e-sports department.'
b'"In the European comparison, Germany is going behind," explains VfB chairman Roughman.'
b'Just to succumb to nostalgia, and chant the old times, doesn\xe2\x80\x99t suffice today.'
b'It\xe2\x80\x99s all about preserving the tradition of the club, but encouraging the company to adapt to the modern market.'
b'"We live in a digitalized world," also says Dutt.'
b'"There can\'t be any doubt that just like football, everything stays the way it always has."'
b'Drug-Eier ade - The Egg Alternatives for Cooking and Baking'
b'The scandal of poisonous eggs is now affecting almost all states.'
b'Aldi South and Aldi North have responded and rescued all eggs from the sale.'
b'In the shelves will only be taken eggs that do not contain Fipronil.'
b'Carter convicted of the lyrics that drove Conrad Roy to suicide'
b'A woman from Massachusetts was sentenced to two-and-a-half years for embarrassing her boyfriend through texts and calls to suicide.'
b'Carter, now 20, will spend 15 months of her sentence behind bars and five years were put on parole.'
b'Clark was arrested in June for faking the death of Conrad Roy, who died on July 13, 2014.'
b'The father of Roy said at the hearing on Wednesday: "My family is unbelievable.'
b'My son was my best friend."'
b'Kelly was allowed to remain free until the career ended.'
b'She was faced with a maximum sentence of 20 years, but her lawyers argued that both she and Mr Roy suffered from a mental illness.'
b'In red shorts and a cream-colored shirt, Carter stood there with tears in her eyes, with bare hands and downed eyes when she was arrested.'
b'"Ire actions have killed Conrad Roy," the prosecutor told the court.'
b'"She ended his life to make her own better.'
b'She has not taken any responsibility," she said.'
b'"She has shown no reluctance".'
b'But Carter\'s lawyer said it was a "sad circumstance that she completely regrets".'
b'Lawrence Moniz, however, said he did not find out that their "age or recurrence or even their mental health has a significant impact on their actions".'
b'A prosecutor read an explanation from Roy\'s mother Lynn Roy, which stated that there is "no day when I do not accept the loss of my beloved son."'
b'I want him to be proud of me and how I am dealing with everything. I intend, despite all my pain we will bear for the eternity with us, to be there for his sisters," it reads.'
b'Larry\'s sister, Camdyn Roy, said she was "vindicated" by the revelation that she would never be able to attend the wedding of her brother or be a dancer for his children.'
b'"Not having this single person I\'ve been with every day since my birth is a pain I will always remember for the rest of my life," she said.'
b'The case seems to set a legal precedent as there is no law in Massachusetts that makes it a crime to force one another to commit suicide.'
b'John Carter was 17 years old when Roy was found dead in 2014 of a carbon monoxide poisoning in a vehicle.'
b'The case drew national attention after Carter\xe2\x80\x99s text messages revealed that she had encouraged him to end his life.'
b'"Hit up, jump from a building, first start yourself, I don\'t know, there are many ways," she said in several messages she had sent in the two weeks before his death while he was in the country with his family.'
b'In the moments leading up to his suicide, she wrote: "You have to do it, Conrad" and "All you have to do is turn off the generator and you will be free and happy."'
b'Moniz said that Carter was seeking attention by the death of Roy and ordered that she should be benefited by some press of the case.'
b'The case has shared the legal opinion.'
b'To the few who defended Carter was Amanda Knox, who was arrested in 2007 for murdering her British fellow in Italy before being released two years later.'
b'Knox, 30 years old, published a comment in the Los Angeles Times: "Michelle Carter deserves compassion and help, not prison."'
b'Kimmich: Learning from the new mini-lair of the NFL'
b'That Joshua Kimmich was on the podium at the Audi Cup as the captain is no coincidence.'
b"The Yankees are tracing the Confed Cup winner a big season - extra motivation doesn't hurt there."
b'Irving was there differently on his place in the cabin, which Joshua Kimmich immediately saw, even though the extra clothing was very, very small.'
b'But as far as the second day of the Audi Cup, of course, there was no Philip Lahm and even no Manuel Neuer to be seen, he made the him toddler bitch at the arm.'
b'"The coach didn\'t announce it," the Confederate Cup winner told reporters behind the scenes, after his first service as a Cavaliers captain.'
b'Well, the assault would have run better than 0:2 against the SSC Neapel.'
b'But the sign from the coach could be deemed Kimmich too.'
b"Not the eight-year-old Arturo Vidal was in the out of youth players, debutants and just out of the holiday season, professional C-Elf as the game's leader, but he."
b'Foodl you\xe2\x80\x99re going to distribute to those you trust a lot, who you want to keep at laziness.'
b'If you\xe2\x80\x99ve been blessed to enter the Era of Lahm, a little extra motivation can only be good for you.'
b'Kimmich confirmed: "This is what you want as a player: to take responsibility".'
b'On Tuesday, the 22-year-old was flying as a mini-lake across the field.'
b"Right down, this is now his position, the white bear at arm's neck did its utmost."
b'And even Kimmich appeared to be the one in this starting formation as the one who can take the wheel too.'

b'"The most fortunate day in my professional life was the day when I lost in my job," he once said.'
b'After Stations in Lima, New York and Paris, he reached the doorstep in the mid 60\'s: with the rejection of his cartoons in "Paris Match" and then in "Stern" and other leading magazines around the world.'

b'The assassination of a journalist underlines the growing threat in Mexico'
b'The staff of the weekly tabloid Riodoce normally meets twice a week to check their plans for reporting on the recent chaos in the state of Sinaloa caused by organized crime,corrupt officials and unprecedented drug wars.'
b'But at this moment, in the shadow of their own tragedy, they came together to talk about security.'
b'It was told them that it is important to change their routines.'
b'Two high-profile journalists are discussing what feels more secure: They should take their children to the office who were the target of an attack with granaries in 2009, or leave them home.'
b'Security experts have written three words on a table at the front of the room: enemy, newtrale, defenders.'
b'They ask the reporters to propose names for each column - no evidence is needed, perceptions and bodies suffice.'
b'There are drug smugglers, politicians, businessmen, journalists suspected of being on the payroll of the government or the cartel, a catalog of smugglers that make the chaos of Mexico dangerous.'
b'There is no resting place from the violence, and while in the whole country, more and more journalists are getting involved: at least 25 since President Luiz In\xc3\xa1cio Lula da Silva took office in December 2012. 589 are standing up after attacks and threats under federal law.'
b'Under the last one is their hermit and her inspiration from Riodoce, the co-founder of Javier Valdez Cardenas.'
b'"The biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and be a journalist," Valdez wrote in one of his numerous books on violence involving drugs.'
b'His failure is deeply felt, though his presence is everywhere - a large photo of Valdez showing his middle finger with the word "Justice" hanging at the facade of the Riodoce building. Two reporters in the three decades of his career were interviewed by the Associated Press'
b'The workshop takes place less than two months after his death, and the reporters discuss their shared themes, the trauma, their Alpt dreams, sleepless nights, paranoia.'
b'While 2010 a special federal prosecutorship was established to handle the cases of journalists, this, according to the Committee on the Protection of Journalists, only initiated two criminal investigations.'
b'As for most of the tens of thousands of murders committed every year with drug trafficking and organized crime, the murders of journalists are only rarely put before trial.'
b'At Riodoce they still insist on treating the violence of Sinaloa, though they are untruthful and though the Terrain is even more sinister now.'
b'Without information about the murderers, without justice, the meeting has little use to the discussion of security, says Ibarra.'
b'"It\'s very dumb to waste my time in this workshop," he says.'
b'"So long as we don\'t know the why, we\'ll miss everyone."'
b'On the morning of May 15, Valdez departed the office of the newspaper Riodoce in the state of Culiacan.'
b'He only managed to drive a few blocks farther before his red Toyota Corolla was approached by two men. He was forced out of his car and 12 times shot on him, probably because of the name of the newspaper - which was named "Zw\xc3\xb6lfter".'
b'The scoundrel drove away in his car and damaged it in front of him.'
b'Martin Valdez was 50 years old.'
b'He left behind a wife and two elderly children.'
b'Gerries refuse to fly freely around in Culiacan.'
b'But for Valdez, there is practically nothing but silence.'
b'By Guzman\xe2\x80\x99s arrest last year and the expulsion to the United States in January, Sinaloa had become one of the most blurred slams of the country, as rival factions fight here to fill the void.'
b'It doesn\xe2\x80\x99t make sense that in Sinaloa every day someone or several people are killed on the street or that the cemetery is full of empty, two-story mausolea for drug kings that are bigger than many houses for the lives of those killed.'
b'Remember for a minute that there is a state of "rule" when only a cartel has control over the coastal state with its valuable ports and drug trade routes into the United States.'
b'However, despite the fact that Valdez was aware of the dangers of his work, Isaac Bojorquez (60), a co-founder and director of Riodoce, is torn apart with the guilt that he could not protect his friend.'
b'He believes that two misunderstandings contributed to the murder.'
b'First, in February, there was the closure of an interview with Damaso Lopez, an initiator of one of the rival cartels in the war with Guzman\xe2\x80\x99s sons.'
b'This publication may have disappointed the sons, suggesting gang members were buying up every copy of the issue as soon as it was sent to newspaperskioske.'
b'The second mistake was not to force Valdez to leave the country after arresting another newspaper that had published the same story, leaving the country to its own safety.'
b'Martin Valdez was a legend in Mexico and the U.S., and his execution is considered a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists.'
b'He had survived so long that his friends and colleagues assumed he would always be there.'
b'He was an experienced reporter for Noroeste in 2003 when he teamed up with five colleagues to launch Riodoce and sold 50 US dollars of shares.'
b'In Sinaloa, "it was impossible to operate journalism without resorting to the smoke-free problem," Bojorquez said.'
b'With the passage of time, the newspaper earned a reputation for muttering and honest reporting, and the revenue and advertising took over.'
b'Journalists loved being able to publish hard-hitting investigations without fear of censorship, and readers were fascinated by a publication where they could read stories that no one else was afraid to treat.'
b'Two years after the founding of Riodoce, she received the prestigious "Maria Moors cocaine award" for her coverage in Latin America.'
b"In the same year Valdez won the 'International Press Freedom Award' from the Committee on the Protection of Journalists for his courage in exposing Mexican drug history wherever it led."
b'He gave voluntarily that he was afraid.'
b'"I want to live," he said to the time of CPJ\'s award.'
b'Drug trafficking in Sinaloa "is a lifestyle choice," he said in an interview with RompevientoTV last October.'
b'"You need to take the role that suits you as a journalist - either that or you play the dumb.'
b'I don\'t want to be asked: "What did you do at the time of so many deaths... why didn\'t you say what was about to happen?"'
b'The Riodoce team miss Valdez, the funvogel who could flush like a dock worker, the friend who was generous with hugs and advice, a teacher who knew how to survive.'
b'They trusted on his routine.'
b'He would always wear his hat.'
b'He would always go to El Guayabo, the bar opposite the office, and always sit there at the same table.'
b'Now, they ask: Was his love for routine his demise?'
b'His death also forced them to question their own assumptions about how they can best perform their work and while staying alive.'
b'"They don\'t like it when you\'re dealing with their women, their children, their clean-up businesses, their home starts and landings," to move drugs.'
b'"These things were not allowed," Bojorquez said.'
b'The result is, even in the best times, a high degree of self-zension and self-confidence.'
b'Setting your own insecurities.'
b'If it smells wrong, stay away from it.'
b'The trouble is, said the editor of Riodoce Andres Villarreal, that "food is a sense that can be abused... and then the thing happened with Javier."'
b'The old rules, as he and others say, no longer apply in Sinaloa - as well as in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states where a gifted mix of lusty smuggling routes, sluggish institutions and corrupt officials.'
b'The landscape is constantly changing.'
b'In the room where the staff of Riodoce met for security training, suddenly no phones were allowed. Days before, it was known that spyware sold exclusively to governments was used to spy on journalists and activists in Mexico.'
b'Suddenly, two cops sucked protection from the heat of 104 degrees (40 \xc2\xb0 C) in the shade of a tree.'
b'They were commissioned by the state government to protect the offices of Riodoce in a four-storey building in a middle-class vibe of Culiacan.'
b'Four inches in the shade, some of the reporters wondered if these officers were part of the 50 percent of the police who the governor himself described as not trustworthy.'
b'It\xe2\x80\x99s been months since the reporters went to the mountains where the drug bandits are de facto under control.'
b'For the edition of this week, Riodoce has been gazing at three main stories.'
b'There was the assassination of the brother of the former known boxer Julio Cesar Chavez in Sinaloa.'
b'They also had an excerpt on the state expenditures that focused on the hometown of the Governor.'
b'And there was a group who performed an encampment in one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan, a block away from the office of the prosecutor.'
b'There was no official word on who was arrested or how it happened, so precaution was advised when it was time to write what everyone in the city knows: that the restaurant is a favorite place of drug dealers and authorities.'
b'A reporter learned from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politician who is affiliated to the governing Institutional Revolution Party (PRI), which ruled almost the whole century all political levels.'
b'Recently, several PRI governors have been accused of high-profile cases of corruption.'
b'Villarreal asked the reporter to write about prior incidents in this locality, including one in which a son of "El Chapo" Guzman committed a military overdose.'
b'Only a few months earlier, readers would have considered the column of Valdez to be the best-informed source on the enemy.'
b'"Finally, we\'d already known what happened," Villarreal, 46, with the nickname "El Flaco" because of his slim body build.'
b'"Now all channels of communication with our sources are broken."'
b'The office of Valdez became the surveillance room for signs and posters protesting the murders of journalists because the staff have become something they never expected themselves to be: activists in the name of the press.'
b'Journalist Miriam Ramirez snapped a few signs and went to a demonstration next morning for another journalist to the office of the prosecutor.'
b'Adame disappeared three days after Valdez was killed, in the western state of Michoacan.'
b'A dead body was discovered and officials say, based on DNA tests, that it is his.'
b'In the whole country, journalists have become louder by calling in organized protests "SOS Press" on walkways and buildings.'
b'At this moment, director Bojorquez is away in Washington and is trying to collect international support for the Justice Department in the case of Valdez.'
b'At a meeting with the Governor of Sinaloa on the day after the assassination of Valdez, Ramirez accused the authorities of spying on journalists and leaving them to die because they said the truth.'
b'She has since requested that she be reinstated by the government because she is concerned that her whining has hurt her objectivity.'
b'Martinez had repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico were "surrounded by organized crime, involved government officials and an equal society."'
b'In his last book, "Narco Journalism," he wrote that reporters are not only killed by drug bandits, but also on orders from politicians and security forces who were caught with organized crime under a blanket.'
b'The media whistleblower group "Articulo 19" has said more than half of attacks on journalists have been to police and officials.'
b'"In Mexico, you die because they want you to keep your mouth shut," Ramirez said.'
b'Off the top of my head, the murders have an abnormal effect.'
b'Never forget the death of blogger Maria Elizabeth Maquiao in the northern border state of Honduras six years ago.'
b'Your body was found along with a note that was allegedly signed by the Zetas cartel: "Here I am because of my reports."'
b'A computer keyboard and headphones were lying next to her abdomen.'
b'Some Filiales have voted to close, such as the newspaper El Norte in the northern border state of Chihuahua after the murder of Correspondent Miroslava Breach in March.'
b'Others continue to do as El Manana of Nuevo Laredo did after the assassination of her director in 2004.'
b'2017, the Diario de C\xc3\xb3rdoba publicized the drug cartel with a headline on the title page with the subject line "What do you want from us?"'
b'Some journalists have emigrated from their home states or even from the country.'
b'It\xe2\x80\x99s a painful decision.'
b'It\xe2\x80\x99s hard to find work in the exile, and they still watch the streets and look for dangers.'
b'And sometimes they are murdered, as is apparently the case of Ruben Espinosa, who was murdered in 2015 along with four women in a apartment in Mexico City three months after fleeing Veracruz.'
b'For those who stay back and continue working, it\xe2\x80\x99s a daily dance with risky decisions.'
b'Ibarra, who aspired to be a dime-a-dozen, admits that the drug trade embarrasses him.'
b'"Mexico goes to hell, and so I became a reporter," he said.'
b'By mid-afternoon last Friday, when the last issue was already over, the reporters of Riodoce sat on the B\xc3\xbcrgersteig before the office and drank beer, when on one occasion all their phones started to suck.'
b'A series of shootings with bandits rivals and security forces in the vicinity of the beach resort of Mazatlan had left 19 confirmed dead.'
b'The war continued as promised by a series of Kartell bodies in the region.'
b'From the Borders Channel, they have posted the news on the website of Riodoce via phone.'
b'The title page had to be changed the next day.'
b'Sirens heal up in the distance - another shooting in the area.'
b'Bojorquez wasted a look at the cops who kept waving to see if they were in attendance.'
b"If they even had fear, they didn't show it."
b'Under the spectacular portrait of the fallen founder of the newspaper, whose middle finger was visible for quite Sinaloa, the staff of Riodoce followed his trails.'
b'"How can you even think of closing," Bojorquez said, "when on the same day that Javier was murdered, the intern asked me to send her to report on the street."'
b'Dinosaurs used tarn to escape from their enemies'
b'On the surface it looks like a statue, if not an outrageous one.'
b'Now researchers have found that the first discoveries of the amazing nose of a Canadian mountain worker were so well preserved that experts have described it as "Mona Lisa of dinosaurs."'
b'It was so well preserved that they even found that his skin was of reddish brown - and they said she would have had some of an "unpleasant past."'
b'The report in the journal "Current Biology" described him as "the best preserved intact dinosaur ever found, and one of the best dinosaur specimens in the world".'
b'The fossil is a newly discovered species of nodosaurian that lived in the middle of the dinosaur era between 110 million and 112 million years ago.'
b'Your amazing well-being condition has been reported by researchers who describe it as "very impressive"'
b'According to reports in National Geographic, the poisonous plant was the most preserved fossil of its kind.'
b'It was found by Shawn Funk on March 21, 2011 in the Suncor Millenium Mine in the vicinity of Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta, Canada.'
b'He spotted something that seemed feverish from the surrounding rock, and decided to look closer.'
b'The discovered fossil was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology.'
b'They spent the next six years exploring the wildest animal within the 2.500 pounds (1.100 lbs) of the creature.'
b'After all this hard work, the finished result is now ready to be enclosed.'
b'"If you just blink a little with your eyes, you could almost believe it slept," said the main author Caleb Brown, scientist at the Royal Tyrrell Museum where the creature is to be seen.'
b'"It will enter science history as one of the most beautiful and most preserved dinosaur specimens - the Mona Lisa of Dinosaurs."'
b'For researchers, this plant-fed dinosaur, though covered with a rubber and resembled a walking panther, was likely attacked by meat eaten dinosaurs.'
b'The strong-paned dinosaurs used a red and white tar to conceal themselves from smokers, and used an abduction technique known as counterbalance, which is also used by many modern animals.'
b'This would have allowed it to migrate better into its surroundings and escape its enemies, experts say, which suggests it was threatened by larger dinosaurs.'
b'The 110 million-year old creature from the family of Nodosaurians first made headlines in May and is now in the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.'
b"For researchers have now studied the wild animal and called it Borealopelta markmitchelli after the museum's engineer Mark Mitchell, one of a team that spent more than 7,000 hours investigating it carefully."
b'The ingenious preservation of the specimen enabled Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and form of shots and rifles across his body.'
b'They discovered the conqueror, a common defensive method in the animal kingdom, which means that the top of the creature was darker than its bottom.'
b'While concatenation is common, the results are surprising as the size of Borealopelta exceeds at the very least the of today\xe2\x80\x99s animals.'
b'It is believed that the dinosaur was hunted by plenty of pressure by meat eaten dinosaurs, that evolution favored the shifting of conquest as a means of survival.'
b'But most of the time-honored animals that use condoms - think reptiles, zebras or gorillas - are much smaller and more vulnerable than bees, which signals that this nodosaurian is facing a real battle for survival.'
b'"Starfish\'s rape record on a massive, heavily-paned dinosaur shows how dangerous the dinosaurs\' rapes must have been of the dinosaur era," Brown said.'
b'The chemical analysis of organic connections in their scales also shows that the skin of the dinosaur was red.'
b'Researchers continue to monitor the animal for signs of life, including its preserved digestive tract, to find out what it has eaten as its last meal.'
b'They believe that the dinosaur, when he died, fell into a river and was driven into the sea beyond where he sank on the back of the seagrund.'
b'To this day Alberta was as warm as South Florida today, and rivers and oceans were likely much further north than they are today.'
b'"This nodosaurian is truly impressive because it is fully covered with preserved skin, but also remains intact in three dimensions and maintains the original shape of the animal," Brown said.'
b'"The result is that the animal today looks almost as it did in the early cranium.'
b'You don\'t need a lot of imagination to reconstruct it. If you just squinted a little with your eyes, you could almost believe he\'s at sleep."'
b'The cranium era was a time when huge theropods, fleeting dinosaurs that stood on two legs, dug through the earth.'
b'While the king of them, the Tyrannosaurus Rex, lived millions of years after Borealopelta, the gory dinosaur was hijacked by some of its terrifying predecessors.'
b'This includes the Acrocanthosaurus, a 38 foot (11.5 m) long, six ton monster.'
b'The scientists whose latest findings appear in the journal Current Biology believe Borealopelta died after death in the sea and was mutilated.'
b'The creation was discovered by Shawn Funk on March 21, 2011 in the Suncor Millenium Mine in the vicinity of Fort McMurray in the North of Alberta, Canada.'
b'According to the museum, it is the best preserved clay dinosaurs in the world, including skin and rubber, and is complete from the chest to the shoulder.'
b'The creatures were about 18 foot (5 inches) long and weighed up to 3,000 pounds (1.300 lbs).'
b'It encompassed two 20-inch long tops raging from its shoulders.'
b'The researchers believe the poisonous plant was swallowed up by the western Canada until an overflowing stream flooded it into the open sea.'
b'But the underwater bequest of the dinosaur preserved its reputation in exquisite detail.'
b'The versteaved surgical remains of this particular specimen are so well preserved that the skin remains still cover holstered pants along the dingy'
b"As Michael Greshko wrote for National Geographic, achieving such levels of conservation is as 'like a win in the lottery'."
b'The more I look at it, the more confusing it becomes.'
b'Vertical fragments of skin still cover the holstered pants that carry the skull of the animal.'
b'His right forefinger is at his side, his five fingers are crossed down.'
b"I can count the shovels at his socket'."

b'According to police, at approximately 17.00 a.m. between the intersections Adelzhausen and Odelzhausen (Land of Aichach-Friedberg) during a tornado nearly 30 vehicles, including likely trucks, crashed into each other.'
b'Over the exact number of fatalities, there were initially no figures.'
b'It handles minor to moderate injuries, a police spokesperson said.'
b'A large contingent of ambulances was at the scene.'
b'The A8 was completely shut off towards Chicago.'
b'In the direction of Chicago, around ten miles long backstay formed.'
b'As a AZ reporter reports, even on the opposite side of the road, there were massive delays - by numerous gators.'
b'The fire department noted the marks of vehicle drivers who are now subject to emphasized penalties.'
b'After 18:45 a.m., there was another accident on the A8, this time between Austin and Dasing.'
b'However, there was a collision between a car transporter and a truck.'
b'A ambulance was traveling to the scene.'
b'Bahn: Company is testing "Comfort Check-in"'
b'It\xe2\x80\x99s a moment that almost everyone has experienced: Nothing aside from sitting in the train and sobbing.'
b'Or you\xe2\x80\x99re wrapped up in your work and just have a brilliant thought.'
b'And then: puff.'
b'Comes the shutter and weeps one uncomfortably or rubs the rider right out of the workflow.'
b'Fahrenheit control.'
b'But the days of subscriptions are soon to be over.'
b'The U.S. Department of Transportation is currently testing the ubiquitous fare control system.'
b'You just confirm by phone that you have taken your place and thus entitles you to the fare.'
b'The current run is a test run on two tracks.'
b'"Coming to the offer, far from it.'
b'It will then be available towards the end of the year on many other ferry routes in the U.S.," a rail spokesperson said.'
b'"Comfort check-in" is what the rail calls the fare enrollment without cheques.'
b'To use, however, some requirements must be met: You need a smartphone or tablet.'
b'And you have to book an online ticket - which without a doubt is what most riders already do.'
b'You also need to buy it via the app of the rail, which is probably the easiest way of ticket booking.'
b'And lastly, you need a seat reservation.'
b'But the "comfort check-in" works like this: You get into the train, call your ticket under "My Tickets".'
b'At the test customers, then there is a button for electronic encryption.'
b'The train attendants get a notification on their mobile devices that passenger X is in the train and has taken the booked seat Y.'
b'Comes the train attendant at the ticket counter at Place Y he knows there is a passenger sitting with already enrolled online ticket.'
b'You can also continue to sleep, continue to work, continue to swallow.'
b'The "check-in" has two benefits: one for the customer, another for the train - which again benefits the passenger.'
b'"If you want to travel relaxed without ticket control by our train attendant, just check in the DB Navigator yourself.'
b'This allows passengers to personalize their journey time in the train," says Michael Peterson, marketing director of DB Fernbuss.'
b'Second Plus: "And our staff have more time than today to work on the individual client needs".'
b'Whoever frequents rail knows that along with delays and missed trains, ticket controls are one of the biggest irritants.'
b'But often, you yourself, in any case, but one of the fellow travelers, don\xe2\x80\x99t have all the documents you need to enable you to purchase online tickets.'
b'Entire credit card or personal statement or otherwise a document you need to present.'
b'The result is endless discussions between train attendant and passenger, which leads to poor ambiance in the departure or large room and delays in controlling your own ticket and the skipper taking the time at the end to take care of other concerns.'
b'Still, only a small number of test customers are using the new service.'
b'And that\xe2\x80\x99s just on the connections CTA 915 Dallas-Stuttgart and CTA 912 Dallas-East.'
b'Other track numbers on the same track are not yet released.'
b'As an activist, I came to learn the answer to the question: "Whose Streets?"'
b'On August 9th, 2014, Brittany Ferrell was shocked up to her core.'
b'Only a day after she arrived in New York City, the in St. Louis Geborene sat on the bed of an Airbnb apartment she rented and scrolled through Facebook on her phone.'
b'She stumbled across a post from someone from high school.'
b'"The police just killed an 18-year-old child, and it\'s still lying on the road," it said there.'
b'Verified that no one else had posted the information on their feed, she closed Facebook and opened Twitter.'
b'A user with the handle @TheePharoah was constantly retweeted on their timeline.'
b'The rapper from the area of St. Louis was about to tweet the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed black 18-year-old who was killed by a white cop in Ferguson, Mo., live.'
b"He posted a picture of Brown's lethal body stretched out on the road and would stay there for four hours."
b'"That\'s wild," thought Ferrell at last.'
b'But the death was nothing new for them and their community.'
b'She dropped her phone to return later that evening to tweets about people on the Canfield drive.'
b'There were photos of the police band and people who shouted, and of a man claiming to be Brown\'s father who wore a shirt with the caption: "Ferguson police just killed my uncle!"'
b'He watched a live feed where a cop stood before a group of demonstrators with a bell-ringing dog.'
b'In another video, she said, another cop engulfed his rifle and shouted: "I will kill you... animals all."'
b'"That\'s not usual," Ferrell recalled her statement.'
b'"This is not the kind of murder we\'ve been accused of and that we can call typical."'
b'In this moment, I felt chills.'
b'I was whining and crying."'
b'He booked a return flight and went home the next day.'
b'After landing at 23 she picked up her 6-year-old daughter from the house of her father and agreed that the two would drive to Ferguson next morning.'
b'What happened in the following three years with Ferrell and Ferguson is the subject of a new documentary film, "Whose Streets?", in the cinemas starting on Oct. 11.'
b'It is a story of survival and protest, of love and loss, of strength and resistance that exists from the perspective of the people who live in the community and have filled the streets asking for answers.'
b'When Ferrell with her daughter, who wore a flower dress and an appropriate crown, walked down to Ferguson, the two engaged in a conversation they had unfortunately not had before this morning \xe2\x80\x98about the black experience and the black condition\xe2\x80\x99.'
b'"You remember how I taught you when black people have to fight for what they believe?" she recalled what she said.'
b'"We\'re going after Ferguson now because police killed an 18-year-old boy and that wasn\'t right.'
b'"I couldn\'t take them with me," Ferrell said later.'
b'"What happened today is a culmination of what... what happened in the past.'
b'You need to know it and see it and be drawn into it.'
b'You must be well-developed, not just activism and organization, but also know the different layers of black experience and black constitution and what we need to do to become free to free ourselves.'
b'Even though I have the privilege of giving her an experience where she personally does not experience any egregious racism, she is not different from the next black women kid.'
b'I have the feeling I would give her a bad service, keeping her away."'
b'The first stop when they arrived in Ferguson was at South Florissant Road, a place opposite the police department that became a campground when the activists waited for the possible non-attack of Officer Darren Wilson.'
b'They connected Ferrell and her daughter with a local business owner who made lunch.'
b'They prepared bags beforehand and helped to distribute them to demonstrators.'
b'Long story short, a new kind of activism began to take shape for Ferrell.'
b'"My activism has totally changed after August 9," she said and notes that she was a student at the University of Missouri-St. Louis president of the Minority Student Nurses Association and focused on food justice and health disparities in black students.'
b'"I had no experience in organising.'
b'It\'s all come to an end."'
b'Two weeks later Ferrell met during an evening demonstration of Sabaah Folay, one of the co-directors of the film.'
b'Jan Foucault said she and her cameraman Lucas Alvarado-Farrar just wanted to "document what happened."'
b'A question came in Ferrell\'s mind: "Would you document or try to find a story you can exploit?"'
b'This skepticism was fuelled by countless cases of people being abused, often by whites - in a community that profited from their pain and resistance.'
b'As Foley recently explained in an interview: "We had heard people who grew up in Ferguson didn\'t center their voices and we wanted to do it differently."'
b'Foley had already worked with the late co-director Damon Davis, an artist from the area known for his activism rumoured to be deadbeats.'
b'Your commitment brought Ferrell closer to the project, along with six other immigrants following the team of "Whose Streets?" in the years after Brown\'s assassination.'
b'"This documentary is not someone speaking for us or talking to us. We\'re talking," Davis said.'
b'"That was the main thing for me about how these people are being presented, for so I will be presented."'
b'The goal wasn\'t to focus on Ferrell\'s experience - to show that it\'s not about the movement "not a Messiah flock, but a community that comes together," Folana said - she emerged as the open-minded participant.'
b'In addition, documents from "Whose Streets?" reveal surprisingly personal aspects of Ferrell\'s life as she falls in love and marries her wife.'
b'"I felt like naked," Ferrell said and laughed when she saw the finished product for the first time.'
b'"But I understood that there must be a certain impunity with this work and with the persecution of black people."'
b'Furthermore, Ferrell\xe2\x80\x99s story repeats the role of black women in the broader Black Lives Matter movement.'
b'Two of the three founders of the movement, who after killing the black teen Trayvon Martin in 2012 the film "BlacklivesMatter" in social media, identify as gay.'
b'"Black, black women in leadership positions have contributed to the movement overall," Ferrell said, "and therefore we are constantly fighting at various fronts.'
b'white, black women must bear the main burden of everything."'
b'Foucault agreed, to note that "the movement is really held up by black women and many black women".'
b'She also states that "this is not an affirmative type of action," where Ferrell was selected due to her identity as the heart of the film.'
b'"She was the person who surrounded this energy," she said.'
b'"It\'s no coincidence, though she was at the front of the line because at a lifetime at these crossroads as a black, black woman, so much is on the line.'
b'You can feel their energy through the screen."'
b'Inzwischen are the news cameras in Ferguson long gone, but the racist ties between the community and police continue to exist.'
b'Farrell is on bail for 21\xe2\x81\x842 years for blocking off an intersection at a demonstration.'
b'She describes the sociological atmosphere of the area she calls her home: "A Chaos".'
b'However, she kladders at a vocal chords and she feels this habit has been attached to her since she went on the road in Ferguson three years ago.'
b'"It is our duty to fight for our freedom.'
b'It is our duty to win.'
b'We must love and support each other.'
b'We have nothing to lose - except our chains."'
b'From "Tranquility" to "Greatest Truth": TV viewers debate about Bit Gallery'
b'The Bit Gallery moves the people, though it hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been built yet.'
b'But the idea of a shopping center at the south end of the pedestrian zone has divided the population into supporters and opponents since the first presentation in 2009.'
b"Calmly, the issue hardly leaves one's mind."
b'Even on our Facebook page "Volunteer Bitch Bitch" the topic is being discussed.'
b'While the one to the Bit Gallery say: "This would be a dream come true" (Anja Becker) or "This would be really awesome" (Nicole Schausten), comes from the other side: "Don\'t blame a person" (Siggi Betzen) or quite simply'
b'While advocates insist that a gallery attracts more customers to the city whereas the remaining businesses benefit, the opponents fear that then the pedestrian zone will burn out.'
b'Hint: The gallery will be built just on the property on which the farmers market hall is set up, where 13 direct sellers will be selling their products.'
b'With the start of construction work, it will be concluded.'
b"The Gallery's owners want to incorporate a market hall into the new build - and that's to the Beda platform with room for outside sitting."
b'George Zimmer: "We\'ve been buying almost weekly in the farmer\'s market hall for many years.'
b'Maintaining our eggs, but also the delicious cakes of the country women always enjoy them.'
b'Even the meth has been discovered for us.'
b'We would like to see that even during and especially after the construction of the Gallery, there is a chance to maintain this offer on a regular basis.'
b'In other cities, this is also available.'
b'Most of the small-market hallway in New York is interesting."'
b'Gerry Densing: "Obviously, if direct sellers are attracted to a market hall in the Gallery, it comes down to the amount of rent.'
b'The may be low at the new project but probably not exactly low."'
b'Kilic: "Where to find shopping malls in Bitch?'
b'Be it clothing, shoes, drug stores or grocery stores: I think that\xe2\x80\x99s overboard.'
b'Of course there are plenty in our city.'
b'You can see how many stores are empty here - some for months and years.'
b'While there\xe2\x80\x99s not even a proper weekly market here, it\xe2\x80\x99s by far the most important thing to us to keep at least the market hall intact.'
b'But because their locally sourced goods are fresh, they are offered largely directly from the producer and are obediently priced.'
b'As you can see, storefronts in a shopping center are only occupied by larger firms, because their rents are often not worth it for an individual.'
b'Sadly, specialty shops almost don\'t exist anymore and what\'s left of them will probably disappear as well."'
b'Fandel: "A shopping center with a market hall doesn\'t fit together for me.'
b"And the gallery doesn't fit into Bitburg."
b'Vortex: Where should the farmers market hall be during construction?'
b'The old Edeka would be the solution - even on a temporary basis if the Bit Gallery ever actually arrives.'
b'Do you think the creepy Bit Gallery was going to get all the business out of Bitburg?"'
b'Marquez: "This just won\'t work.'
b'And a shopping center that\xe2\x80\x99s empty doesn\xe2\x80\x99t need anyone either.'
b'My guess is it would have been better to promote a proper farmers market instead of this gallery.'
b"But for a farmers market hall, thanks to the crazy many - as far as I'm concerned - useless construction projects in Bitburg, there's nowhere to go."
b'If the farmers market hall is broken down, another piece of culture will disappear."'
b'A matching similarity: Artist creates portraits with Chelsea Mannings DNA'
b'In the middle of the room of Fridman Gallery in New York City, there are many faces to be seen - white, black and brown, which almost seem to resemble each other - hanging at cables from the ceiling.'
b'The 30 portraits were created by the artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg from nose tightening and haircuts sent to her by Chelsea Manning.'
b'Manning scooped the extracts from the prison of Fort Leavenworth, where the former CIA analyst was sentenced to a 35-year prison term after she admitted to censoring diplomatic reports via the website WikiLeaks.'
b'The new exhibition, which opened on August 2, is called A Becoming Resembling Resembling (A Perfect Similarity).'
b'She is the product of two years of correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg, whose discipline combined her expertise in technology, computer science, and art, and Manning, a transgender woman and away-from-home dissenter whose conviction of Barack Hussein Obama in the U'
b'Dewey-Hagborg has, through the algorithmic analysis of the DNA extracted by Manning and created from the 30 portraits of how someone could look with these genomic data, made a sharp, if somewhat iffy comment not only on the formability of the genome, but'
b'Manning, who was born Bradley Edward, but has spoken openly about being a woman since her puberty, was arrested in 2013 for 20 charges, including six violations of the spy law, computer fraud and theft.'
b"Throughout the prison, her image was undermined, so much so that there was only one single photo - a cursed, black-and-white selfie in which Manning sits consciously uncomfortable on a driver's seat and wears a platinum-blonde"
b"In 2015, Dewey-Hagborg just came from the great success of her 2012-project 'Strange Visions'."
b'That\xe2\x80\x99s why the artist produced portraits of strangers from forged artifacts such as cigarettes and cigarettes by extracting the DNA from the waste to create a picture of how these people could look.'
b'This was the moment she received an email from a newspaper magazine.'
b'"They did an interview with Chelsea Manning while she was in prison, and they wanted a sort of portrait to accompany this article," Dewey-Hagborg explained at a press conference of the new exhibition.'
b'And she couldn\xe2\x80\x99t be visited to this day and she couldn\xe2\x80\x99t be photographed, so they took contact with Chelsea and asked if they wanted to do a DNA portrait.'
b'The artist and her infamous Muse became unlikely letter friends who exchanged several letters in the course of two years.'
b'They even snapped one of Sholokhov\'s illustrated comics "Suppressed Images," which predicted a future where the president\'s ruling would change and she would be impatient to see the exhibition personally.'
b'That Obama was actually just a few days after the book was published, demanding Manning\xe2\x80\x99s release after seven brutal years in a military prison in Kansas was a welcome kind of happy reunion.'
b'There is also some deepness and Starkes now at the opening of the exhibition, as Donald Trump is conducting a war against informants from the government camp and against transgendered terrorists to find new, tweetable ways to address the starvation divides that he actually advocates for.'
b'When Dewey-Hagborg was asked about the random timing of all these things, she said that "things happen for a certain reason".'
b'In an on the wall of the Gallery nevertheless candid statement, Manning with her overgrown signature below (the "i" in her family name is pronounced with a heart) called for an end to "automatic corruption whose foundation is gender, race, ethnicity'
b'On the opposite wall, their mitochondrial DNA sequence - a tens of Cs and Gs and As, written in bleeding.'
b'Dewey-Hagborg hoped through the addition of the 200 letters (or nukleotide according to the highly advanced scientific dictionary of the artist) to show how imaginatively similar, at least in biological terms, we all are.'
b'"What people will hopefully take away from is that our genome doesn\'t care who we are and how open genetic data is for interpretation and how subjective they are," said Dewey-Hagborg, whose video work of 2007, Spurious Memories, also released in 2007.'
b'"DNA data can tell so many different stories, therefore that\'s 30 of these stories."'
b'The last piece in the exhibition, which is on display in a dedicated room, is a page from the above comic novel.'
b'She shows Manning how she emerges with a freezing phone in her hand from the disciplinary circles of the United States like King Kong.'
b'"If they make your speech cold, then they\'ve won," it says.'
b'"Always keep the mouth shut".'
b'"It came straight from a letter she wrote to me," said the artist who greets from Philadelphia.'
b'"I still get giggles when I talk about it."'
b"Manning hasn't personally seen the exhibition yet - as was anticipated in the comic book - but if she should, then she'll be welcomed in the middle of the room by the masks, by their own genomic simulactors, who will behave like they're"
b'This was also targeted, as was everything in the exhibition, to the size (5 " 2, Mannings statue), where their genetic haplo groups were written with bleeding.'
b'"In the past I had them at the wall, but I wanted them to feel like a people crowd," Dewey-Hagborg said of the portraits.'
b'"I wanted it to feel like a mass movement forming with Chelsea, like the movement that was also behind their liberation."'
b'Professor of the University of Northwestern and an Assistant Professor of the University of Oxford for torture'
b'A nationwide human hunt is in the works for a professor at Northwestern University and an adjunct professor at the University of Oxford who are being investigated as suspects after a man had been stabbed in a luxurious apartment in Chicago with fatal injuries.'
b'On Monday, for Wyndham Lathem (44) and Andrew Warren (56), there were charges of murder for their alleged involvement in the death of Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranleau, according to the acknowledgments of the Attorney General of Cook County.'
b'The documents say that Cornell Duranleau, 26, died after multiple stabs.'
b"One of the police department of Chicago's most common warning systems states that the leak was discovered on July 27."
b'Beavers received a call, arrived at the Grand Plaza Apartments and found the victim with multiple injuries to his body.'
b'Cornell Dunleau was still declared dead at the scene of the crime, and detectives are investigating the screams as murder, while police are actively searching for the two suspects, officials said.'
b'Alahem has been an extraordinary professor of microbiology and immunology at Northwestern University since 2007.'
b'John K. Cubbage, the Vice-Chancellor for University Relations, said in an email statement that Lathem has now been inadmissible and has been excluded from visiting the campus of Northwestern University.'
b'"This is now a criminal matter being investigated by the local authorities, and Northwestern University is cooperating with this investigation," Cubbage said.'
b'Warren is a Senior Treasury Assistant at the University of Oxford.'
b'A spokesman for the University and Somerville College said in an emailed statement that "we are in contact with the police in Britain and ready to help the U.S. embassy authorities on any errand."'
b'The statement added that Warren\xe2\x80\x99s colleagues were stunned and wanting to see him face to face.'
b'Chief Communications Officer of the Police Department of Chicago, Anthony Guglielmi, said he is forcing the suspects to submit to the authorities.'
b'"The police have an idea of their place of residence, and our efforts to locate them intensify," Guglielmi said.'
b'Guglielmi said local, regional and national authorities are helping to find the suspects.'
b'Guglielmi said police received a call from the building manager of the Grand Plaza building, who had just received a clue that indicated something had happened in apartment 1008.'
b'The police described the scene as very cruel.'
b'Guglielmi said it is unknown whether the incident happened even on July 27.'
b'It was confirmed by security cameras that Lathem and Warren were in the building.'
b'"We believe Professor Latham and the victim had a relationship," Guglielmi said.'
b'The management team of Grand Plaza released a statement to residents: "The police are currently working on the timeline and the background of the victim and investigating a variety of motives, including a possible domestic incident."'
b'"We will be able to complete the WADA road plan in near future" - the Russian Vice-Premiere Mutko'
b'The Russian Vice President Vitaly Mutko said it won\xe2\x80\x99t take long for the remaining criteria of World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) to be implemented for restoring the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (RUSADA).'
b'"In a certain stage of fulfilling the criteria of the Fahrplan, RUSADA has the right to plan and test in collaboration with UKAD (UK Anti-Doping Agency).'
b'The WADA schedule has been updated in this respect," Mutko explained on Wednesday.'
b'The PM commented on the second part of the Fahrenheit of WADA to comply with the Code, which describes the criteria for replacing RUSADA and was recently published on the website of the organization.'
b'By Lautko, he contains nothing that could cause concern for Russia.'
b'"Everything was announced, everything is implemented.'
b'And the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and the WADA in near future," he added.'
b'One of the listed criteria, however, indicates that the Russian anti-doping authorities have reported the reported results of the WADA\xe2\x80\x99s investigation by the Canadian lawyer Richard McLaren into alleged state sponsored doping in the Russian Federation.'
b'In terms of the matter, Mutko said: "We are conducting the investigation as our anti-doping system has identified an error.'
b'All measures have been implemented.'
b'But there were no government programs, and we won\'t admit something that doesn\'t exist."'
b'Honestly, the words matched those of Vitaly Smirnov, the head of the independent Russian Anti-Doping Commission.'
b'In conversation with Russian sales rep RSport at the start of the day, Smirnov gave problems of the past in Russian anti-doping organizations, then added: "We repeatedly said that the report contains ominous positions and regulations."'
b'No one has before accepted this report," Smirnov added.'
b'RUSADA was excluded in November 2015 in the wake of the doping scandal by the WADA from conducting doping checks in Russia.'
b'You, however, are allowed to plan and coordinate tests under the supervision of international experts and the UK Anti-Doping Agency (UKADA).'
b'After a visit to the headquarters of the organization in Moscow in July, WADA general manager Olivier Niggli explained that RUSADA is moving "in the right direction" to be used again.'
b'Aldi is about to sell no eggs more'
b'This, the corporate groups said.'
b'It is a pure precautionary measure, it may further be of no health concern, it said in the statement.'
b'As of now, only eggs may be delivered to Aldi that have been tested negative for fipronil-containing antibiotics.'
b'Aldi aims to create clarity and transparency among his clients.'
b'Start-ups that will help your business not become the next Uber'
b'Errett wanted to measure happiness at your staff at your e-commerce start-up, but the surveys didn\xe2\x80\x99t work.'
b'Answers were often vague, little helpful, or - even worse - bogus.'
b"And even though you promised anonymity, some workers didn't trust the process."
b'"There just never was consistency and objectivity," said Errett, who runs the 75-person San Francisco e-commerce hair care company Madison Reed.'
b'He has called for help from outside.'
b'A new breed of Human Resources start-ups is at the whim to help companies find out how their employees feel.'
b'By creating and licensing software that has the specific purpose of measuring employee engagement, it enables companies to conduct surveys, target specific groups and demographic groups, provide employees with anonymity and complaint hotlines, as well as improve employee engagement.'
b'"They now have tools like Strava and Fitbit for tracking their health, but where is the Fitbit for your business?" said Jim Barnett, co-founder and chief executive of Redwood City start-up Glint, whose software analytics tools are of the utmost'
b'Errett said that they gained a better insight into what your employees think and feel in the three years with Glint.'
b'Additional to the Snap Surveys and Surveys of certain teams, it offers a heat map of the company that shows on one page which units have the most complaints and which managers have low approval scores - so you can look afterbodies.'
b'People are coming to a conclusion that you need to stay at the top of the workplace culture so you don\xe2\x80\x99t become the next Uber that has been involved in scandal since a former employee posted a blog post describing an environment of intimidation where you can\xe2\x80\x99t get to work.'
b'For start-ups like Glint, this desire for an overview is a lightening business opportunity.'
b"The Global Governance, Regulation and Compliance industry could be worth more than $ 118.7 billion by 2020, according to the financial technology website Let's Talk Payments."
b'Denver, Colorado, start-up Convercent, which helps companies prevent and detect bad behavior, saw a rising interest and activity beginning this year in the wake of Uber\xe2\x80\x99s fiasco.'
b'Convercent has almost 600 clients, including Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.'
b'Uber has recently registered as a client.'
b'Like Glint, Convercent lets companies send customized "pills" surveys, collect confidential answers in real-time, and view the heat maps of your trouble areas.'
b'It also provides an anonymous SMS hotline where staff can report bad behaviour.'
b'And if the principal business owner is involved, complaints will go directly to the onus.'
b'"The court of public opinion has captured the Regulators," said Patrick Quinlan, the founder and director of Convercent.'
b'If a company is found to treat its employees poorly or be unethical, it can experience costly consequences through consumer boundaries, employee fraud and lawsuits, Quinlan said.'
b'Ruby Tuesday, the restaurant chain with more than 30,000 employees and over 500 locations, has used Convercent for more than a year to ensure that employees are aware of policies and procedures and have an easy way to reach their corporate centers.'
b'Later, if an operator wanted to report a problem, he or she had to find a phone number or email for the corporate center, submit a formal complaint and hope that it was taken seriously.'
b'It was often an awkward and uncomfortable experience, said James Vitrano, Ruby Tuesday\xe2\x80\x99s general counsel, who said there was no good way to track down complaints from staff.'
b'Now, as the company uses Convercent, issues that were previously hidden from executives sitting in offices in cities or states can be identified and addressed faster - such as discrimination, abuse or unlawful practices.'
b'"I can get closer to this wholesome, 360-degree sense of experience with employment," Vitrano said, who chairs the Risk Management Group of Ruby Tuesday.'
b'"And we protect our shareholders from employment lawsuits."'
b'Business began to take equality, values and employee engagement seriously in 2002 after the bookmaker Arthur Andersen collapsed because of ethical violations by the Enron scandal, Quinlan said.'
b'But it took the "Society Media to come to their right," that companies realized they could not prevent their crappy laundry from going online.'
b'"Before using technology to monitor ethics, people used hope as a strategy," he said.'
b'So both Glint and Convercent offer your software as a service, and burden the companies with repeated fees for using their products.'
b'It is a business model and opportunity that will find the approval of Venture Capital Investors who have supported both start-ups.'
b'Convercent received $ 10 million in funding in February from firms such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, whereas the entire capital was raised to $ 47 million.'
b'Litzer secured $ 10 million in November from Bessemer Venture Partners and brought his entire funding to $ 60 million.'
b'These investments come hardly surprising, given the networked nature of businesses, culture, and venture capital.'
b'There is a growing complex of research showing that today\xe2\x80\x99s employees expect more from their jobs than ever before.'
b'In competitive markets such as Silicon Valley, high salaries and interesting projects are just avenues.'
b'The employees want to feel that you are accepted and appreciated and that you are giving your time to a company with a positive mission.'
b'"If people are happy to be in a company that hears their voices, and that the work you do is worth it, then they feel stronger about making this company successful," said Nina McQueen, vice president of Global Benefits and Employee Relations.'
b'An investor achieves returns when their portfolio companies are doing well. Companies run well when employees are engaged and engaged.'
b'If the analytics tools of third parties promise to increase engagement and the use of staff, it\xe2\x80\x99s no wonder you\xe2\x80\x99ll find support.'
b'The data about employee engagement is important according to the experts of workplace culture.'
b'But the data is useless if the directors of a company don\xe2\x80\x99t take action.'
b'In fact, if a company asks staff for your feedback, it may have an expectation that change is on the way.'
b'And if the change isn\xe2\x80\x99t coming fast enough, or even not, this can breed enthusiasm and demotivate agents.'
b'"If you ask for 4,000 suggestions, you need to be willing to have 4,000 conversations," said Russell Raoh, President of Consulting at the Business Management Company Kotter International, who has seen companies who have relied too heavily on saving data.'
b'"Then if you don\'t follow staff will ask, "Do you really listen to me?'
b'K\xc3\xbcmmern\xe2\x80\x99t you about it?'
b'And if you don\'t care, why should I? "'
b'Reed, who now conducts monthly staff surveys, was able to initiate action on the same day when an issue is reported about Glint, Errett said.'
b'And after sampling feedback from frustrated employees, she was rewarded by the speed of decision-making and quality of communication, inability to reorganize several teams within the company and adding a communications scheduling to address the issues at hand.'
b'At Ruby Tuesday, the company is always receiving new insights about the employees, and it hopes that on a long term basis, this will lead to a better bias of workers in an industry known for high turnover.'
b'"If you are not obligated to create a culture of transparency, you will lose the people," Vittoria said.'
b'"And when you lose people, you also lose clients.'
b'And if you lose customers, then you will lose businesses.'
b'The NCAA fixes the two-day practices and makes a long day for the Bruins'
b'It\xe2\x80\x99ll be on 23rd as a lot of UCLA football players congregate on one side of the new practice fields of the team on campus.'
b'Some have pulled out their triceps and show the back full of sweat from the first day of training.'
b'For a good part of the team, these uninterrupted minutes provide a lunch break.'
b'Players who are admitted to the summer classes will return to their final exams after the three-hour exercise to their final exams, before returning the next morning at 6:30 PM to the Waterman Football Center.'
b'"This is a real treat for the boys the next three days," Bruins coach Jim Mora said shortly before the Monday became Tuesday.'
b'The NCAA eliminates two-day workouts to alleviate the burden of players, and it has actually extended its days - at least until the final on Friday.'
b'Therefore, the first three workouts of UCLA will begin at 19:15 a.m. to meet the already fully packed time schedules of players.'
b'The compromise away from the two days is more than a day when the Bruins moved the start of the camp almost a week after the last season and during summer school for the first time during Mora\xe2\x80\x99s six plays in Westwood practical exercises.'
b'They are expected to hold 18 practices in the course of August. 20 before beginning the formal game preparations for their upcoming matchup against Texas A & M in September.'
b'Larry said he supports the rule change of the NCAA, even if it adds to the much-needed routes of players another point.'
b'"We put this enormous strain on them three or four days, and it\'s very challenging," Mora said.'
b'"And they just pushed it through, they\'re placing themselves further, they\'re great people.'
b'I think as soon as we get to Saturday and we have more time, it will be really big."'
b'The UCLA will resume its practices as soon as the camp is complete, which at the same time, clears the clear view lines of its fields from an adjacent parking lot and the adjacent Luskin Center, a hotel of the elite class that already boasts pedestrian bridge'
b'Bruins players are expected to fill the hotel this weekend, but Mora admitted there could be a problem once these rooms are free during the season.'
b'"We will use our security," Mora said.'
b'"This is a real problem, and it\'s not farfetched to think that people will rent a room there and then get there to record an exercise.'
b"If you have the video band of an exercise, it's a pretty good business."
b'But we have security forces there, and we have security forces on parking lot 8.'
b'We will do the best we can with what we have.'
b"I don't make myself all that big a deal about it."
b'We have a plan."'
b'Facebook will intensify fact-checking in the fight against fake news'
b"Facebook will send more potential articles with falsehoods to fact-checkers from third parties and display their results under the original post then, the world's largest online social network said Thursday. It's one of its efforts to detect so-called fake news."
b'The company said in a statement on its website that it will begin using updated analytical learning methods to detect potential falsehoods and send them to fact-checkers who may be able to obtain results of fact-checking from the original article.'
b'Facebook has been criticized as one of the main levers for so-called fake news, of which many believe they have also affected the US presidential elections in 2016.'
b'The problem has also become a major political issue in Europe, although the French voters were flooded with false stories in the lead up to the presidential elections in May, and Germany supports a plan according to which social media networks are to be punished if there are any wrongdoing'
b'On Wednesday, Facebook said in a separate statement on its website that in the US, France, the Netherlands and Germany, a test of the new fact-checking will be launched.'
b'"Nevertheless, knowing which stories are being audited by fact-checkers third parties, people want more context to make informed decisions about what they read and share," said Sara Su, product manager for Facebook news in a recent interview.'
b'He added that Facebook will continue to test its feature to the "incorporated article" and work on other changes to its news feed to reduce false messages.'
b'Create a Comic Novel: A Castle in the History of England'
b'In its younger past, the small Scots Castle was seen in a Squeeze music video and was a cloak for Margaret Thatcher in the mid-1970s and early-1980s.'
b'But Scots has witnessed 700 years of turbulent history from its humble seat in the Bewl River Valley in Kent and is now the inspiration for a graphic novel by Jamie Rhodes, a mourning Yorkshireman with a predilection for historical documents.'
b'"I think it\'s so nice to look at the handwriting of someone who\'s been dead for 300 years," he says softly.'
b'"What a personal relationship to keep this letter in my hand."'
b"'A Castle in England' covers the period from the Middle Ages to the time of Edward and documents the families who lived in Scots. Each story has been illustrated by another, upcoming British artist - Isaac Lenkin, Briony May Smith, William Exley, and many others."
b"It's not the first book by Rhodes to be based on an archives: He wrote 'Dead Men's Teeth and Other Stories' in 2014, a collection inspired by documents in the British Library - a project he found unrelentingly emotional."
b'"I just reacted to the dagger on the page of a letter written by a double agent in the 1700\'s who worked for the Jacobians," he says.'
b'"That\'s his dagger!'
b'Briefs always smell like smoke, for then you burned a fire because of the light.'
b'For someone who lives 300 years later, the scent has an effect as if he were himself too.'
b'Oh, I love archives!"'
b'For someone who is so beaten up with old papers that he\'s supported by the National Trust and Arts Council England and lived almost four months in a castle ("Um, to be honest: I\'ve overlooked my welcome greeting a little") this all seems too nice to'
b'Rhodos spent his days exploring the Victorian "new" castle, looking through the archives, and studying the many treasures and curses of the castle, such as the installed hyena clock towers at the walls and the bottles, which were found in the'
b'He wandered through the grounds and ruins of the old castle and spoke to landscapers, gardeners, and sometimes to the artists who worked on the illustrations of his book.'
b'Then, night after night, he drank "Whiskey and started to write".'
b'The intricate history of Scots is relatively unknown, as the National Trust only received full access in 2006 when the last Erwin, Elizabeth Hussey, died.'
b'When Rhodes arrived a decade later, the attendants just began to take care of the archive, which he described as "Hunting of years in which Aristotle said "Oh, wire it up the roof."'
b'Books, letters from the time of the English Empire, maps showing who was who: "You might think land conflicts would be boring," Rhodes says, "but there was a bird to fight the two families.'
b'boys, let all his gang go!"'
b"Some of the stories in the collection use the castle as an outlet to delve deeper into the English history, including 'The Labourer', which follows a man who leaves the newly built castle to join the farmers' rebellion of 1381."
b'"There is a recording of a survivor who appeared in the castle in 1380, in this book with the title \'Knightly Families of Kent and Sussex\' " Rhodes says.'
b'"The farmers\' strike began in this area and I thought a strike was a good start.'
b'Maybe the two are related?"'
b"Other stories are firmly rooted in the history of the castle - such as 'The Priest', which tells the story of the Jesuit priest, whom the family Darrell hid seven years during the English Reformation."
b"'The Smuggler', in which the clergyman Arthur Darrell is portrayed from the 18th Century, who inherited his own bosom by filling a sarcophagus with stones (a discovery made only years later when his sarcophagus was found"
b'The Darrells are Rhodes\' daughter-in-law of Scotney: "The gentlemen seemed to be pretty gaudy, always making excuses and spending money for things they couldn\'t afford.'
b'Other generations of Darrell mothers solved their debt crises by marrying remarkable old women - I imagine them to be a bunch of well-dressed guys, with a talent to advertise estates."'
b'After the end of his service in the castle, Rhodes is looking for other unique writing experiences'
b'He has a two-year stay in the Finnish wilderness for a comic novel about El\xc3\xa4m\xc3\xa4nm\xc3\xa4ki, the site of a Sanatorio from the early 20th Century, which has since been restored by nature.'
b'But Scotney has a special place for him.'
b'"I was sad to go back," he says.'
b'It was like: "Ah, now I have to get back to living with the damn life."'
b'Promotion campaign launched: Over 300-year-old Maricopa Chapel in Rhineland burns'
b'With the dismantling of the 301-year-old Maricopa cemetery in Roughborough, the City of Bad Honnef on Friday launched its campaign to introduce a new Dachmark (Roughborough News of Thursday).'
b'Up until Wednesday, Mayor Otto Neuhoff and his marketing team around Nelson Artz want to keep the logo and slogan secret.'
b'August, as a culmination of the campaign, there will be a feast on the island of Grafenwerth.'
b'"To be beautiful for us.'
b'Or?", the makers of the action have been asking since yesterday on the posters at the Rhapsody Chapel.'
b'"We don\'t think that (well!) is really true," they write on their yesterday\'s free web site.'
b'"But we use this measure to gain your attention.'
b'And to make it clear that some things are better than it seems.'
b'In the end, we are the firm believer that we as Bad Honnef citizens know very well about the beauty and appeal of our city."'
b'At the moment, the campaign is about more than "just" a logo and slogan, it continues.'
b'"It is advisable to formulate a single promise, one that gives the city an uninterrupted allegiance".'
b'Finally, she stepped into competition with other municipalities.'
b'A modest five-figure fee lets the city of Bad Honnef cost its new roof and campaign.'
b"Military forces in the Middle East - Erdogan's fear of the army"
b'Every year beginning in August, in Ankara, the Chief Military Council (YAS) meets to discuss pensions and appointments in the armed forces.'
b'So much so this week.'
b'On the surface, a normal process.'
b'But nothing is routine at the Turkish armed forces a year after the coup.'
b'The meeting was no longer held in the building of the General Assembly, as used, but in the office of the Minister of State.'
b'At the consultations, under the chairmanship of the Prime Minister, now took place the five vice prime ministers as well as the Ministers of Defense, Interior, Justice and External Affairs.'
b'They were the civilians in the YAS in excess.'
b'The government is pulling the trigger in the military.'
b'General Admiral Hulusi Akari remains in office, but the commanders of the army, the air forces and the Marines were removed.'
b'Since the failed coup, President Erdogan has fired 169 of the 326 Generic Drugs and Addicts.'
b'Over 10,000 soldiers were removed from the ranks of the army - usually because of alleged ties to the movement of ex-prisoned cleric Fethullah G\xc3\xbclen, whom Erdogan sees as the driving force behind the coup.'
b'According to 486 persons alleged to have been directly involved in the coup, in since this week in Ankara.'
b'Amid the day after the coup, Erdogan had called the coup a "goal" since it gave him the opportunity to "fully reinstate the armed forces".'
b'But does Erdogan really imitate the army?'
b'February, the newspaper "H\xc3\xbcrriyet" published an article with the headline "Unemployment in Military Headquarters".'
b'In general, there are concerns about an increasing "Islamization" of the army, which manifests itself in the lifting of the headline ban on soldiers, the newspaper wrote.'
b'The big reboot at the army and security forces certainly goes on.'
b'July, Erdogan per decree fired another 7395 officials, including 2303 police and 546 soldiers.'
b'However, it seemed as if Erdogan forced the military.'
b'The chiefs used to be considered the actual gentlemen of the country.'
b'Two times put them under suspicion of their role as whistleblowers of the world\xe2\x80\x99s constitution.'
b'After his election in 2002, Erdogan drowned the power of the military step-by-step, not surprisingly under the pressure of the reforms of the European Union.'
b'Matrimonial officers say Erdogan is planning to target a jihadist invasion of the armed forces.'
b'In the magazine "Vocal Europe," a named noted officer warned that after the coup, out of fear of persecution in the foreign, the Turkish army will be "full of extremists and salafists" in a few years.'
b'Triggering that, one of those developments could not keep the Nato cold.'
b'Without a doubt, in the alliance after the storms, there is doubt about the use of the Turkish army.'
b'The leadership structures and operational skills are "destroyed," say Nato leaders.'
b'Washington changes the rules for the Green Card'
b'There will be a new U.S. immigrant plan to change the rules of the Green Card, President Donald Trump said, citing the media.'
b'He proposes to cut legal immigrants to $50,000 per year, tighter regulations for obtaining visas for a temporary work permit and restrictions on family-based visas.'
b'The new rules are proposed by the Republicans and supported by the President.'
b'The bill is expected to be debated in the two chambers of Congress.'
b'"This bill will reduce poverty, increase wages and save billions of dollars for taxpayers and will do this by changing the way the US is giving out green cards to citizens from other countries."'
b'The law will prevent chain migration and replace the current system.'
b'This new recruitment process will benefit the candidate who speaks English, who has the financial means to support themselves and demonstrate knowledge that will benefit our economy," Trump said, citing the U.S. media.'
b'Ministerial wants to restore track for race-track shuttle'
b"Often, in the past few months, there was talk about the future of the race track shuttle - now it's supposed to happen quite quickly."
b'Before the end of the year, at the maroon track on which the tourist train rides will be built.'
b'To secure the future of the racetrack shuttle long-term, according to the Transportation Department, construction will begin at the track in late this year.'
b'"With the decision to continue ordering and replacing the track Ilmenau River Trail, the country acknowledges its importance to this most important link," Transport Secretary Keith Snell explained on Friday in Erie.'
b'The cost of inheritance of the track estimated to be about $2.5 million.'
b'From this amount, the country will overtake 75 percent.'
b'The contract on which the shuttle will also be ordered from the country will currently be finalized, S\xc3\xbchl explained.'
b'The ministry and the South Texas Railway as operators have already agreed on the technical details.'
b'"As a result, the fare, the used vehicles and quality standards have been negotiated," Snell said.'
b'The proposed contract between the ministry and the rail company will be for a period of eleven years.'
b'That\xe2\x80\x99s why the race track shuttle was scheduled to be ordered in December 2017.'
b'The Rennsteig shuttle is a mainly for tourists popular train connection between the rail stations of Delhi and Rennsteig.'
b'In the past few months, in the course of a pilot operation, it was being tested to see if the route is being used by adequate many people to order them back regular in the future.'
b'The track is also heavily built in part.'
b'The rise of sex robots is real, and we should be worried'
b'Just when you thought it couldn\xe2\x80\x99t get any more insane in 2017, a new report comes out about the technological developments in the field of sex robots.'
b'Well, actually.'
b'Sex robots are a big deal right now.'
b'Recently, the Foundation for Responsible Robotics (Sustainable Robotics) (FRR) released a report on the development of sex robots in the next five to ten years.'
b'By Noel Sharkey, emerging professor of robotics and artificial intelligence at the University of Sheffield and co-founder of the FRR, we need to start taking their ascension seriously.'
b'Customers can choose the eye color of the robot, its shape of breast and the type of fingernails.'
b'"They\'re making fun of them, but the companies are delivering tons of them, and we\'ll be getting them even more frequent to see," Mr Sharkey said at the scope of his new report.'
b'Modern sex puppies have evolved from their on-the-go partners to robots with a silicone head that feels warm - with intentional human responses achieved by artificial intelligence.'
b'The user can also "choose" his robot according to his/her beliefs and while selecting everything, from the eye color of the robot to the shape of his/her breasts to the type or color of his/her fingers.'
b'But it becomes even more disturbing as many robots own the "perceptions" that would make a Stepford woman look progressive.'
b'Modern sex puppies have evolved into robots with a silicone head.'
b'The RealBotix robot allows for example its users to adjust their robots to the features they find appealing such as shielding.'
b'And then there are those by True Companion developed Roxxxy Gold sex robots with preprogrammed personalities such as "Frigid Farrah," which conveys the impression of smugness and "Wild Wendy" with a "absolute" personality.'
b'"Roxxxy Gold has a personality that is as well adapted to your personality," the website of True Companion states.'
b'So she likes what you like, and she doesn\xe2\x80\x99t like what you don\xe2\x80\x99t like, etc.'
b"She's got her moods in the course of the day too - quite like real people!"
b'She can be tired, stuck on contention or she can be "in mood"!"'
b'There are many disturbing aspects to this upsurge in sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the underwhelmingly feminine qualities, the accentuations on rape when you take a step on Frigida (heiness) is one of them.'
b'On its website, True Companion rivals Roxxxy with a vibrator, but for men.'
b'"If women can (sic) have a vibrator, why can\'t men then have no roxxxy?" reads the website.'
b'However, these sex robots are not just a fetish or kind of just another sex toy.'
b'Your enthusiasm and its increasing refinement point to something darker and deeper in our culture, to a retreat from the ideal of equality of genders to a desire for sex with submission as an optional tobacco.'
b'Most men won\xe2\x80\x99t seek to hold sex robots, and while the FRR notes their rising popularity, they still remain preoccupied with the consumption culture.'
b'But getting through the margins can be very educational in terms of the spirit of the time we live.'
b'And many people are not random or rude until they are given the free market to do so.'
b'There is indeed a certain over-reliance on these highly developed sex robots in a time when the rights of women are threatened around the world, in a time when there is a president praying to have women sexually assaulted in the White House.'
b"The most shocking aspect of the television series 'The Handmaid's Tale' ('The Report of the Magd') isn't the graphic images, the missing bodies and the empty eyes, but how realistic this vision looks."
b'The Republic of Gilead is a twist, but in the moment, this does not feel like a big twist.'
b'The goal behind these sex robots is to make a physical resemblance to actual women as realistic as technically possible (though with pornographic proportions).'
b'Your creators want them to feel human, that they follow the movement of a real body.'
b'But, on the contrary, when it comes to their "perceptions," the robots do not represent real women.'
b"They can't get away from their companion or just walk away."
b'They don\xe2\x80\x99t have a vow or a background story, nothing that hinders unity or anything that could disturb the imagination of total submission.'
b'Differently, they are considered slaves.'
b'Or to put it in the way of 2017: service girls'
b'Trump\xe2\x80\x99s big performance?'
b'He makes Mitt Romney the incarnation of the healthy human mind'
b'It has become a binary fact of the Trump era that the political divisions that have popped up popped up even families in small-scale format.'
b'Runding around Christmas and Thanksgiving, there were newspapers in the US with advice about how to deal with the horror of Trump\xe2\x80\x99s choosing relatives.'
b'We all are supposed to be trying to plague our filters.'
b'Nowhere has been noticed the power of Trump to bring families together.'
b'I mention this because my co-author, a leftist dime-a-dozen who lives in Chicago and has been working with the Republicans in our family for a long time, visited me in New York this week.'
b'She reminded me that uniting against a common enemy can have a powerful effect.'
b'With Trump in the White House, everyone she knows, including the Republican fraternity she had fought for for decades, is suddenly and quite distinctly on the same page.'
b'To the Esquire, this is certainly a good thing, but it occurs to me in another context that this also involves significant risks.'
b'The left was strengthened by Trump, but the ensuing effect of his presidency has the power to push us all down the right.'
b'If we\'re talking about "Normalization" and Trump, we\'re talking about the gruesome possibility that we won\'t be able to stop his antics one day.'
b'There is, however, an even more shocking long-term scenario in which Trump "normalizes Republicans of the right" who suddenly appear to be indifferent to his standards on a daily basis in comparison to his standards.'
b"I find myself plagued nowadays by an active notion of Mitt Romney's ubiquitous version of the fool - the dog on the car dashboard, the 14 % income tax (but at least we knew how his tax statement looked) - which bothered me in comparison to"
b'When Trump goes, the next candidate of Republicans just needs to be intellectually healthy to qualify as an unprecedented improvement.'
b'When my co-worker was in town, we brought our kids to cartwheels in Central Park, the largest of cartwheels of the New York Park department, and the best three dollars you can spend in the city if you don\xe2\x80\x99t need coffee.'
b'The horses are enormous, the Fiberglas designs on the central cylinder - all the clowns are kneeled and the animals twisted to look full of fear over their own shoulders - extremely finicky and the clenched music presents this to strange sounds.'
b'So many clich\xc3\xa9s of a city ensue: The views of tall buildings become old, the skylines become too familiar to offer much excitement, and the reality of the city is not matching the dream.'
b"Three hundred years later, and I'm still not quite over the day when I found out that Swiss Cottage is in fact not a Swiss Cottage - the theme-pub Ye Olde Swiss Cottage doesn't count - but a big circular intersection in the north of London."
b'The Central Park carnival, however, is still a random magical experience as here two two-year-olds, an 11-year-old, and two women can go on it in the 40-something years and all have a great time.'
b'If I could have evaluated the Karussell, I would have given him the full score, but for the record, no one has asked for it.'
b'Otherwise, in this week\'s shopping, I was forced to review my "experience" with transactions on a scale of one to five stars before I could pull through my credit card.'
b"In the coffee house at the corner of my street, it's the same thing, plus the option of balancing the rating with a 15 % drink - this to buy something over the counter."
b'This does not only lead to a slowdown of what was supposed to be a neutral exchange, but also exerts pressure on the server to incorporate personality into a situation where no is required.'
b'The poor woman in the Kaufhaus stood enthusiastically grinning while I was tired of the experience of giving her my credit card with five stars.'
b'Pistorius with bruises from the prison moved to the hospital'
b'Pistorius has left the prison for the second time for a hospital visit.'
b'In the past year, he was brought to the hospital for treatment of cuts to his hands, which he suffered the prison authorities to date after a case in his cell.'
b'Pistorius was convicted of murder after an appeal by the prosecutors against a first-degree murder conviction.'
b"He killed Steenkamp in the early hours of Valentine's Day 2013, by shooting her more than once through a doorway of the toilet-case in his house in Pretoria."
b'Pistorius claimed that he was keeping his girlfriend for a nightly intruder who hid in the cabin.'
b'The prosecutors have announced their intention to appeal this time against the six-year prison sentence of Pistorius, of whom they say they are too down-to-earth.'
b'The National Crimes Commission said it will file a petition at the Supreme Court of South Africa, and the petition may be heard in this year.'
b'Pistorius runs the risk of his sentence being increased to 15 years if the prosecutors are successful.'
b'There is no death penalty in South Africa.'
b'As a farmer Arnold finds a strange egg'
b'As the last of Blumberger schools, the fourth graders from Foster and Epple were enrolled in the holidays and into further education.'
b'Three of the enrolled students will now go to GCSE, four to high school.'
b"Teacher Angelika Sitte welcomed the parents and representatives of the public at the Citizens' Hall in Epsom."
b'As a symbol of school abandonment, the 29 students of four classes under the supervision of Sophia Schumacher and Regina Meder elected a young adjunct who grows up in the shelter, then ends up in freedom.'
b'This led the mad craziness to a musical titled "The Adler in the Highlands on".'
b'Arnold found a strange egg, and let it grow out of his sheep.'
b'Instead of a sheep cow, a small adder came out.'
b'But the hope of making out of him a fox broke out, the Adler broadened his wing on a tall mountain and escaped.'
b'Then the classes three and four performed a hiatus dance in the assembly of Yvonne Frank.'
b'The Hebrews danced with the young goats, who wore cylinders to win the contest.'
b'The adjunct is steering for integration, said school superintendent Amanda Sitte.'
b'The jungle animal was different from the other jungle animals (cups), but fits the bill.'
b'He will never be like a fox though.'
b'His determination was to be free.'
b'He wishes every fourth grader to feel accepted in his new school.'
b'It was followed by thanksgiving to the co-teacher, the former school superintendent Michael Murphy, who always intervenes in classroom disruptions, and the parents.'
b"The cows' time is now over, class teacher Sophia Schumacher explained."
b'She enrolls her students after two years of lessons only very unfortunately, because it was a really great time.'
b'Conclusion: They have been able to keep up with the fourth graders.'
b'To finish off, all the students let out a song of summer time and holiday time.'
b'There was great excitement amongst the children.'
b'For the new school year, there are already eight first graders registered.'
b'Two Bulgers arrested for illegal camping in Greece'
b'Two Bulgers were arrested for illegal camping in Greece, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, citing the television.'
b'On the morning of August 1, in Sithonia, police arrested a group of illegally zilch people, including the two Bulgers.'
b'At the same time, they were released while currently an investigation is ongoing.'
b'The Foreign Ministry reported bTV that the Bulgers were released later.'
b'The Greek authorities have tightened control over free camp and are placing anyone found to stay at a place that is not intended for this purpose substantial fines.'
b'The controls will continue throughout the entire season.'
b'The ministry said the court can suspend a fine.'
b'Software update for diesel cars: What the victims need to know now'
b'How exactly does the software update take place?'
b'Can diesel drivers participate in the action?'
b'The most important questions and answers in depth.'
b'The diesel summit has offered BMW, Daimler, Ford and the Ford company software updates for total around 5,3 million cars.'
b'They are intended to improve the fuel economy of cars of the fuel class Euro 5 and partially Euro 6.'
b'$4-diesel or worse are excluded.'
b'Susan Smetanin of the ACE Auto Club of Europe gives anecdotal accounts:'
b'Is the new action mandatory?'
b'No, the negotiated software updates are voluntary.'
b'"The mandatory updates previously applied only to the vehicles that have shoddy software," says Anita Smetanin.'
b'Their replacement has been approved by the Motor Vehicle Association (MCA).'
b'How and when do customers become aware of updates?'
b'The manufacturers have announced a prompt implementation in the next few months, but have not announced a specific date yet.'
b'Toyota has agreed to email each and every victim.'
b'If without doubt an inspection was appointed, that will be done in its place.'
b'How long may the upgrades be expected to take overall?'
b'"Quite to say," says Smetanin.'
b'This hangs off the commitment of the manufacturers as well as the political pressure.'
b'"The fact is, we have seen, voluntarily, the carmakers are not acting at the expense of the environment at the moment."'
b'How long will the update take?'
b'The conversion itself could only take three to four hours in the workshop.'
b'Time-consuming it may be to get an appointment.'
b'What about car drivers who don\xe2\x80\x99t drive a car from BMW, Ford, Toyota and the Ford Company?'
b'The ACE advises to wait.'
b'Probably foreign manufacturers would follow, according to Smetanin.'
b'Drought now a massive price drop of Euro-4 cars?'
b'The ACE fears that.'
b'But just in the regions where fares are dwindling.'
b'In the rural area, there have not yet been any value losses for older diesels.'
b'The ACE advises to wait with a sale yet.'
b'Cool J receives Kennedy Center Award'
b'The Kennedy Awards Gala is one of the most glamourous events in Washington.'
b'The first awards ceremony under President Trump promises to become political.'
b"One of the prize winners doesn't want to come - out of protest."
b'Cool J (49) gets one of the most prestigious awards from the prestigious Kennedy Center.'
b'As the cultural institution announced on Wednesday, in addition to singer Gloria Estefan (59), Lionel Richie (68) as well as the choreographer Carmen de Lavallede (86), and the TV producer Norman Lear (95) are among the inductees.'
b'Over the course of the year, the awards will be awarded beginning in December.'
b'Traditionally, US President Donald Trump will host a reception and join his wife Melania at the reception.'
b'The with progressive TV series known as Lear, therefore, has already agreed to decline to participate in the Gala.'
b'The "New York Times" he said: "This president has chosen to completely neglect the arts and human rights - even giving them the means - and that hurts me."'
b'The 59-year-old Estefan stated she will use the conversation with Trump to clarify her viewpoint.'
b"The named after former President John F. Kennedy's Kennedy Center is the largest cultural institution in the US."
b'To the earlier nominees, Meryl Streep, Aretha Franklin, Robert De Niro, George Lucas, Tom Hanks, and Sting.'
b'We make the city more vibrant'
b'Larry Wacker, Haslett\xe2\x80\x99s city builder, is going to retire in the near future.'
b'The position is already advertised - suitable candidates are rare, however.'
b'For 31 years, Wacker has been a city builder.'
b'And the work still makes him great, as he explains in the press interview.'
b'He reports on a variety of challenging, but also rewarding tasks waiting for his successor.'
b'Gleichzeitig, he wonders that there has not yet been any application fulfilling the requirement profile.'
b'The city is looking for an Architect or Building Engineer.'
b'So - subject to the regular termination periods - there will still be enough time for an interview.'
b'Has Haslett acting for the Verwaltungsgemeinschaft as the Under-Secretary of Buildings, the candidate must present appropriate approvals.'
b'But this feature the city wants to keep on.'
b'Wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be able to fill these out, the citizens would have to drive to counseling up to Oklahoma City.'
b'But citizenship is important to the city and its people, says Wacker, who reports of a good operating environment as well as good mood between authority and citizens.'
b'In more than 30 years in office, some significant projects have emerged, on which Wacker looks with pride.'
b'"We make the city more vibrant," he is confident about the building department and its staff.'
b'But even in the future, a host of projects are on the horizon: The redevelopment of the former Hukla Avenue and the Niederhofen Parkway are about to be initiated.'
b'The Kinloch Bridge between Bollbrook and Stonebrook is being refurbished, even the stadium\xe2\x80\x99s refurbishment is still an issue.'
b'All of the last one will be worth around $1.5 million, "if we\'re doing it right," Wacker estimates.'
b'"All in all, great tasks are waiting for my replacement.'
b'The work here makes me laugh."'
b'Gesture was great for a city builder.'
b'With Hasley\xe2\x80\x99s own built-in farm and garden, he could be fairly flexible on many things.'
b'"You can move a lot," Wacker added, and the design of the greenhouses is often mentioned by citizens and visitors.'
b'While the downtown is under construction as an ensemble, it is important to have "an eye for what fits in," when new buildings are approved, the councillor states.'
b'Without a doubt, the city builder bears high responsibility.'
b'He\'s builder, "at the end of the day, everything here runs over my table".'
b'At support and coordination, he can count on long-time staff: Mark Neumaier (Hoboken) has been involved for ten years, Mandy Sch\xc3\xb6ner (Titan) for 15 years.'
b'However, to ensure his replacement stays long-term, Wacker wishes: "We\'re looking for someone who really identifys with the position and wants to stay".'
b'Kontinuity is not only important for a good operating environment, but also for the continued design of the city.'
b'If Roland Wacker wishes to be buried, according to the City of Haslee, he should have a completed degree as an engineer or bachelor with degree in architecture and have good expertise in the areas of construction ordinance and construction planning law.'
b'The city\xe2\x80\x99s building department undertakes highway construction, building ordinance, grounds surveys, administration of borough\xe2\x80\x99s liabilities, swift operations with building yard and city gardens, as well as subdivision building jurisdiction including monuments.'
b'Bikes on wires stolen: South-South-South-South-South-South-South-South-South-South-South-South-South-South-South-South-South-South-South-South-South-South-South-South-South-South-South-'
b'According to police, the previously unidentified thieves had thrown the blue bike off the railway crossing in the area of the Leoben Road (B116) onto the pipes.'
b'They were being damaged so heavily that the approaching cargo had to be kept at bay.'
b'The detectives go by two male suspects and have been looking for them since the night hours.'
b'Located close to the scene, witnesses were observed by a rosary roller and a bicyclist.'
b'"This goes far beyond a layman\'s bubble," \xc3\x96BB spokesman Christopher Posch told the AP.'
b'The or the thieves would have themselves been in great danger and also threatened the trains.'
b'Besides the damage to the railway and the facility as well as the delayed minutes and the cost of rail refuelling, there could also be pockets of rail customers on the culprits.'
b'Ultimately, it\'s estimated to be an "average" sum, the spokeswoman said.'
b'The damage was restored on Friday afternoon, the railway traffic on the southern railway could be operated without disruption.'
b'Ten person trains were out Friday afternoon, two of which entered the ferry.'
b'Metal trains did not fall out, they however had delay.'
b'According to \xc3\x96BB spokesman Christopher Posch, around 200 meters of upper pipes had to be replaced.'
b'Isolation panels and masts were also damaged.'
b'White meat, dairy products and chocolate could help relieve IBD (inflammation of the liver)'
b'Blue meat and chocolate can sound like an Alpaca to your digestive system.'
b'But a new study claims just the opposite: A diet rich in meat-based proteins and dairy products could relieve the symptoms of patients with endocrine disorders.'
b'The unfortunate condition, which affects around 1,3 million and in Britain 300,000, causes stomach cramps and bowel movements, repeated or blurred intestines, weight loss and extreme fatigue.'
b'While the sufferer is normally advised to avoid meat and dairy products to relieve their symptoms, researchers at Washington State University found that the essential amino acid tryptophan of proteins helps to develop immune cells, which in turn increases the ability of the body to fight off'
b'The lead researcher, Dr. Marco Colonna, explained that immune cells in the digestive tract are correlated to ensuring that toxic microbes that lurk in the food don\xe2\x80\x99t enter the body.'
b'Cells that are capable of producing endocrine disruptions are replaced by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging delicate tissues.'
b'If the balance goes too far in favor of endocrine disruption, there may be an endocrine disruption.'
b'In experiments, it has been found that a type of tolerant immune system is present in mice who carry a specific bacterial strain in their ages.'
b'And the bacteria needs tryptophan - one of the building blocks of proteins - to trigger the emergence of the cells.'
b'Colonna said: "We have made a connection between a bacterial species - Lactobacillus reuteri - which is a normal part of the digestive microbiome, and the development of a population of cells that promotes tolerance.'
b'More tryptophan the mice had in their diet, the more they had of these immune cells".'
b'He suggested that the combination of L. reuteri and an antryptophan reduction diet promotes more tolerant, less endocrine disrupting diets when the same system is also wired to humans.'
b'The Post-Doctoral Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barreiro examined a type of immune cell that promotes tolerance when she found that a group of study monkeys had those cells, but another group of the same species, which were separated under the same genus.'
b'He suggested that the difference was related to the digestive microbiomes of the mice - the community of bacteria, viruses and fungi that normally live in the stomach.'
b'The intestines of the mice were DNA-sequenced and there were six bacterial species found in the mice with the immune cells, but without them missing from the mice.'
b'Mice were raised in a sterile environment so that they were missing a darm microbiome and they did not develop these kinds of immune cells, and they received the L. reuteri and the immune cells were created.'
b'To understand how the bacteria affected the immune system, the researchers let L. reuteri grow in a liquid and then traced small amounts of the liquid - without the bacteria - to undeveloped immune cells.'
b'The immune cells developed to be the tolerant cells.'
b'When the active ingredient was extracted from the liquid, it emerged as a side-effect of the tryptophan metabolism, which is known as indol-3 milk syrup.'
b'When the researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in the feed of mice, the number of those cells rose by about 50 per cent, but when the tryptophan levels were halved, the number of cells decreased by half.'
b'Dr. Cervantes-Barbara explained that humans have the same tolerant cells as mice, and that most of us protect L. reuteri in our stomachs.'
b'It is not known if tryptophan neoplasms from L. reuteri develop the cells in humans as they do in mice, but deficiencies in genes in relation to tryptophan have been found in people with endocrine disorders.'
b'She said: "The development of these cells is likely something we would like to promote as these cells control endocrine disruptions on the inside surface of the liver.'
b'Paclitaxel levels can lead to high tryptophan levels in counterpart of L. reuteri leading to an expansion of this population."'
b'Mourinho believes that Manchester United signed Nemanja Matic to be a "giant"'
b'At Manchester United, Nemanja Matic signed a "greatest" contract, Jose Mourinho believes after the midfielder had his debut against Sampdoria on Tuesday night.'
b'The 40 million pounds subscription of Chelsea began with a 2:1 victory in Dublin, the last pre-season game before the UEFA Super Cup against Real Madrid begins on Tuesday, and impressed in the hold-up as people like Paul Pogba and Andrea Pirlo started to show up.'
b'Matic, however, was excluded from the preparations Asia tour of the Blues and only managed 45 minutes, which Mourinho admitted that he needed to improve before starting the Premier League season.'
b'"He needs time, but his experience, intelligence, a genius in the way he thinks - he thinks football," Mourinho said.'
b'"We will help him to be ready sooner than later."'
b'As for Matic, Victor Lindelof and Romelu Lukaku started in the Aviva Stadium as Mourinho formed his starting XI for the start of the season.'
b'The Independent revealed in this week that Mourinho wished for three more renewals, but he insisted the club had already done a "fantastic job" of fulfilling three of its four primary renewals.'
b'"Didn\'t get one of four, for that I thank the club," he added.'
b'"I will be happier if they get four of four for me, but they have given great effort."'
b'Boeing "painted" Dreamliner into the sky'
b'The US aircraft manufacturer Boeing has painted the silhouette of a Dreamliner in the sky.'
b'The pilots flew from Seattle in the US state of Washington, the drawing began but ended up in Marquette in US state of Michigan and crashed in the form of a Dreamliner over the USA, which is several tens of miles.'
b'The action lasted 18 hours and a minute.'
b'On the radar screens, the form of a Dreamliner was to be.'
b'The whole thing was an endurance test for new engines.'
b'Boeing had already made those ads earlier in the day.'
b'So the number "787" and the Boeing logo were painted into the sky.'
b'New low blow for Martin Luther King Jr. - Atlanta, we have a problem'
b'How the wind is indeed blowing: When Sean Hannity was a Republican minister, socialist ministers always looked to New York City with a certain sorrow.'
b'Blossoms from the party center, merely no counter-wind from the state - that was the most important wish of voters.'
b'Since Martin Luther King Jr. leads the party, things have fundamentally changed.'
b'Since then, staff from the Willy Blair House have been monitoring the events in the Republican-controlled statehouses with growing enthusiasm.'
b"What Schulz has been getting from there since the beginning of the year wouldn't even be described with counter-wind in the abstract."
b'It was low tide.'
b'And yet one after the other.'
b'The U.S. CBO sees the surprising end of the redistricting majority in Northern Ireland as a general signal against coalitions of Democrats and Republicans.'
b'"This shows once again: Red Gambia just can\'t govern reliably," Democratic general counsel Peter Tauber told the editorial network of America (RND).'
b'The unexpected absence of a Republican candidate has thrown the government of Prime Minister Stephan Weil (Donald Trump) into a severe crisis.'
b"Three months before the landmark election, his Republican coalition lost it's one-third majority to the opposition from Democrats and Republicans."
b'The Republican National Committee chairman Michael Kellner has urged the absentee-seat niece of Republican Rep. Elke Twest to return her mandate.'
b'The overthrow to the Democrats means a clear distraction from the voter\xe2\x80\x99s will.'
b'Twenty-two must immediately give back their mandate," said the chief executive and candidate of Republicans to the editorial network of America (RND).'
b'"That may not even be true," sighs a Republican candidate as on Friday afternoon the new hiatus message reaches the party center.'
b'John McCain, Republican presidential candidate of Ohio, stands out after the overthrow of green appointee Elke Twesten to the Democrats without own government majority.'
b'It\xe2\x80\x99s the precursor to a whole host of big and small crises in Republican state unions.'
b'And no one knows what will come next.'
b'The mess began with the unprecedented significant defeat at the Sacramento primary in March.'
b'A blue eye, more not, comforted the Genoves of his time.'
b'After the landmark elections in Scotland and Northern Ireland, everything will be different.'
b'This was what it was then - and indeed everything became significantly worse.'
b'The defeat in Kiel brought the Democrats into turmoil, the Dallas-Pleite was driving the party smoothly around.'
b'Husbands recalled the Genoves in the weeks afterwards.'
b'Then, when they had just stirred new courage, the G-20 summit arrived from Houston.'
b'And with it came the next deep blow.'
b'President Obama, the last strongest Republican governor, lost his Nimbus at that time because he sat in the El Chaparral while his city burned.'
b'And because he was doing so much wrong in crisis communication afterwards.'
b'Since then, Scott has been fighting for his political survival.'
b"Now here's Stephan Weil."
b'Throughout the VW fuel controversy and his role in the onus, the Dutch minister has been in the spotlight for a while.'
b'Brutal survey scores came in.'
b'However, or perhaps just because, Weil has been trying harder in the past few weeks to put accents in the state.'
b'The best wishes of the former mayor of Atlanta, expanding his power in New York, also remained intact in the surroundings of Martin Luther King Jr.'
b'They let him be granted, as they promised of Weil a stabilization of the party.'
b'Now the exact opposite of this could arise.'
b'However, Weil does not seem to be at fault for the partial corruption of the Neverland Greens in the least.'
b"And Schulz didn't even bother."
b'Astounded by this, the fraternities therefore endeavour to keep their ranks closed.'
b'Your ridicule is directed at the Republicans, and here especially at the abhorrent senator Twesten.'
b'"It is unacceptable and democratically reprehensible for Mrs. Twest to place her own career interests above the interests of all others," says Matthew Miersch, head of party links in the Democratic National Committee, the editorial network of America (RND).'
b'Kate Twesten has not been elected because of her person as a direct candidate, but over the state list of Michigan Republicans elected to the House of Representatives, the Michigan Democrat further added.'
b'The logical consequence would be that she returns her mandate.'
b'Thomas Oppermann, chairman of the Republican National Committee, complains of an "unconstitutional maneuver."'
b'"The voter\'s message four years ago was clear: People have made Stephan Weil the minister," says Oppermann, who leads the Northern Democrats as the top candidate in the House of Representatives, the RNC.'
b'"Now, the personal career mindset of a future Democratic candidate is compromising the election\'s outcome," Oppermann continued.'
b'He insisted on investigating the origins.'
b'I want to know if there has been more or there have been further calls from Democrats Northern Ireland.'
b'Sponsorships for Orthodox Church of Jesus Christ of Nazareth III'
b'If you want to remodel your in-law\xe2\x80\x99s home, you can get the support of the state.'
b'Moreover, Mayor Albert Schindler and three representatives of STEED City Development spoke in Episcopal Church on Tuesday.'
b'At the beginning of the information session, Schindler gave another look at what has been happening.'
b'Since 1991, in Episcopal Sanctuaries there have been Sanctuaries.'
b'Once again, in Sanctuary I from 1991 to 2004, the state of Florida has taken up two-thirds of the funding sum.'
b'In San Francisco Bay Area II from 2005 to 2016, the exemption was still at 60 per cent.'
b'For Schindler, the current renovations are an "effective project" - it\'s ultimately important to also promote interior development, and not just create new construction areas.'
b'On April 4th, you received the information from the Government of Kentucky that there will be a Sanctuary III.'
b'The grant amounts to $833 333, of which $500 000 will come from the state, the rest from the county Episcopal.'
b'How does it now become a Sanctuary Area?'
b'You will, as Schindler continues, examine where the "real old" homes are.'
b'It also plays a role in whether in the proposed area there is any interest to rehabilitate.'
b'Given the area, the borders could then shift again.'
b'The STEG will be performing Martin Keller, Gabe Pietzschman, and Sarah Gotzel on Tuesday night.'
b'Richmond presented the contents of the federal program "Society City," in which case the renovations would then be performed.'
b'Part of the program is redevelopment of inner cities, improving housing and employment, and restoring and expanding infrastructure.'
b'The measures would be subject to property tax, which means per property.'
b'The Sanctuary area would then finally be established as a statute.'
b'The approval period for the grants has run through January 1, 2017 yet until April 30, 2026.'
b'By September this year, however, there would first be the assessment, in order for those at the Sanctuary to get a questionnaire to fill out.'
b'In November or December, it will be appointed the Board of Trustees so that in the near future, there can be started with the renovations.'
b'Trinidad and Tobago subsequently explained that each municipality would need to carry out the stated preliminary investigations.'
b'It\xe2\x80\x99s all about assessing the city\xe2\x80\x99s failings and deciding when to be rehabilitated and in what way.'
b'There will be a Sanitation Certificate for that particular property then also a Sanitation Certificate in the grounds.'
b'Trinidad and Tobago will come back again after embroidery and get a picture of the situation, she promised.'
b'Melzel stated a key success factor for the project was the involvement of the stakeholders.'
b'Therefore, there will be questionnaire that will be mailed out to the citizens in the coming weeks and can be filled until after the end of the summer holidays.'
b'The yellow questionnaire is called the "Building and Property Survey", where it covers the building\'s condition and the renovation intentions.'
b'In the gray questionnaire, known as the "Habitat and Housing Survey," can be made statements about size, survivorship, and residents of a residence.'
b'The blue "Beginning Point" is only filled out when in the building are business rooms.'
b'However, as Gotzel pointed out, a completed questionnaire is not simultaneously an application for grants.'
b'However, new construction is not encouraged.'
b'Schindler also noted that the distribution of grants is functioning according to the "window-hund principle" - who comes first, mourns first.'
b'You can\'t "reserve" grants for later.'
b'For the final day, there were still photos of the project "Orchard II" being shown to make the attendees "squeeze in" a renovation.'
b'British inventor sets himself a microchip to get in house and car with a hand movement'
b'A British inventor is the first in the country to be equipped with a microchip so he can open his house door, enter his office, and even start his car with a hand gesture.'
b'Northam, 33, had implanted the winged chip between dagger and tailbone and now provides the service for businesses and individuals who want to simplify their lives with technology through his company BioTeq.'
b'He has teamed up with Dr. Geoff Watson, a Consultant Anaesthetist at the Royal Hampshire County Hospital in Winchester, Hants, to ensure that the implant procedure is performed according to medical standards.'
b'The technology is similar to a cat and dog implanted microchip and only takes 30 seconds.'
b'The company of Mr Northam also wants to change the locks to homes and cars so that they are compatible with the chip, all for a surcharge of \xc2\xa3300 per lock.'

b'The green-white Sikorsky VH-3D, known as Marine One when the President is at sea, was the heart of the event on July 17 in the White House with EPA building programs.'
b'Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence, and directors of the White House made a round-up of products from all 50 states.'
b'The in Connecticut manufactured hub was installed alongside a yacht from Maine, a fire truck from Wisconsin, and a gauntlet from Mississippi.'
b'The military office of the White House requested the presence of the Hubble in a fragmented order or FRAME, barely 36 hours before the Hubble landed on the South Lawn, according to the recordings of the Marine Helicopter Squadron One (Squadron One).'
b'"I just wanted you to be aware of it because it is an astonishing event with high visibility," the commander of the HMS-1 wrote on the front of the event to his superior, the lieutenant marine commander for aviation.'
b'The news showed that the hubbub arrived on the South Lawn on July 17, at 7 a.m. tomorrow morning on the South Lawn for the event at 15 a.m., and stayed so long as the grass was cleared between 18:00 and 21:00 a.m. at this'
b'The note adds that, if the departure from the White House should be delayed due to the limitation of service hours, a second team would be needed for the return flight.'
b'The original air crew was at the hub during the event while the security staff of the unit remained on the ground during that time.'
b"From the TIME's recordings, it wasn't clear whether ultimately a second flight crew was required."
b'The Hatch Act prohibits federal agents from using government property for political purposes.'
b'Data shows that HMX-1 asked if the event could violate the determination.'
b'"One question we asked was whether it was an infringement of the Hatch Act and we were informed that this was not the case," the commander wrote.'
b'"Klingt as if you\'re locked up," replied the appointed commander.'
b'The event "Made in America" was referred to by the White House as an official event and would not have been covered by the Hatch Act.'
b'But even official events have political upper hand.'
b'On the event, the President gave an impetus for reforming health care reform that was in the Senate, and he promoted the efforts to amend government regulations.'
b'The use of the plane known as Marine One or Air Force One for politically favorable purposes is hardly a new phenomenon.'
b'Presidents are obliged to use them for the journey.'
b'But their use only for a photo surgery is unusual.'
b'President Trump conducted an investigation in February when the president\xe2\x80\x99s plane was serving taxi services near the time of his first campaign rally in Melbourne, Florida, and his Twitter account is full of stories about the use of the president\xe2\x80\x99s plane by his predecessors.'
b'"The White House is excited about the show "Made In America" - showing products from all 50 states made by American workers using American materials," said the chairman of the White House, Lindsay Walters.'
b'HMX-1 fighters typically conduct training flights in the area around Washington and in the South Lawn to defeat the US president in the White House with accurate centimeters.'
b'When Trump was on the G20 summit in the U.S. in July, HMX-1 ran 58 exercises in the White House.'
b'The flight for the "Made in America" event ranked at the training needs of the air crew for the month, said an official.'
b'Helicopters will float additional 11 hours at this time for "Non-Presidential Unified Missions".'
b'The White House said taxpayers assumed the burden for none of the other revenues presented on the event.'
b'A spokesman for Sikorsky said the company was not involved in putting out the hub on the South Lawn.'
b'HMX-1 does not undertake budget recordings for the presidential flights, and it is difficult to estimate the exact cost of the event.'
b'According to hour rates by the US Veterans Administration for the fiscal year 2017, the DoD refund rate for the VH-3D is 24.380 USD per flight hour.'
b'On recordings of the unit, the flight time of the plane is recorded as 30 minutes from the home base of the Marine Corps Air Facility in Quantico in Virginia.'
b'The White House argues that the actual cost of operation of the hub is far below this rate.'
b'"The cost for taxpayers to determine on the basis of estimates for the reimbursement rates is highly irrefutable," Walters said.'
b'"These estimates include personnel, maintenance and many other hidden costs included in the annual funds."'
b'According to a RAND study from 2015, the refund rates for DoD do not include the personal expenses, but include the cost of fuel, maintenance and contract completion.'
b'To this day, the former press secretary of the White House, Sean Spicer, defended the use of the Hub for the event.'
b'"The idea is to present things this week that are made in America," Spicer said.'
b'"And I know Sikorsky and the state of Connecticut are very proud that they contribute to our national security, and I\'m going to bet hundreds, if not thousands of people are dependent on them.'
b'And I think like most Americans, we are all proud of the Hub and other military equipment for which so many Americans have worked unreservedly.'
b'It is natural to highlight that."'
b'It wasn\xe2\x80\x99t clear if Trump intercepted the shot when he entered his roundabout across the South Lawn for the event, but he stepped into the driver\xe2\x80\x99s seat of a fire truck.'
b'In the White House, Trump spoke to representatives of Sikorsky and chatted to the media about his own fleet of corporate products.'
b'"I know Sikorsky very well," said the President, "I have three of them."'

b"How America's OMV Can Hurt You"
b'Weakly, Donald Trump didn\xe2\x80\x99t seem happy when he put his signature Tuesday night under the law to curtail sanctions against Russia.'
b'"In his hatred of the law," the Congress has inserted a few "constitutional regulations," he muttered.'
b'However, the response from Moscow was as sharp as expected, and even Brussels rejected the US proposal.'
b'Nevertheless, the draft proposal seeks to punish European companies that help the Russians build gas pipelines into the EU.'
b'Entirely disturbed have since been investors of the domestic OMV, which jointly with other European firms finances the construction of the Russian East Sea pipeline North Stream 2.'
b'The drooping curve is tremendous.'
b'However, it is too early for an assessment of the consequences, according to the official statement by the oil company.'

b'Leadership Responsibility: The City is putting in place 46 kitchen assistants'
b'The city organizes the nursery lunch again itself.'
b'With dedicated advisors for the children and a to-do list for the team.'
b'In the suburbs, the clock is drawn backwards.'
b'For September 1st, the City of Kentucky will take over food distribution in the borough\xe2\x80\x99s Children\xe2\x80\x99s Homes (Children\xe2\x80\x99s Homes) back into ownership.'
b'For Sonja Pommeranz, Associate Director of the Department of Youth Services, this is a good news: "We all enjoyed it."'
b'Cooking is continued outside the house: A caterer will take care of this task and deliver fresh cooked at home.'
b'The city operates 46 kindergartens in the Crescent area, in 44 the children get a warm meal to eat at lunch time.'
b'In the past year, each year, 2800 children sat at the tables, and demand is growing steadily.'
b'"Without a doubt, not only do children who are supervised for 45 weeks are eaten in the nursery to lunch," Pommeranz explains.'
b'"This offer also applies in the 35-hour program when children stay until 14 a.m."'
b'3 part-time staff will have kitchen service from September 1st: They heat up the delivered meals, add them to salads, raw vegetables and fruit, portion the meal individually, give out the meal, clean up, vacuum and clean the kitchen.'
b'"The workers are assigned firmly to a nursery," Pommeranz says.'
b'The size - there are two-group as well as seven-group facilities - determines the hourly rate.'
b'"The kitchen volunteers are now firmly part of the nursery team," Pommeranz says satisfied.'
b'"So they are a lot more involved and it is easier for the nursery to implement educational concepts".'
b'But even though it\xe2\x80\x99s all about: healthy nutrition and cooking lessons.'
b'"The children shall help to prepare the food".'
b'The direct involvement of the kitchen staff to the team is daunting.'
b'Even for the kids.'
b'"They have a well-known force in the nursery, a person who is familiar to them, and not constantly changing people".'
b'This consistency was important to the children.'

b"GMB's concern about investments in McVitie's factory in Glasgow"
b'A union would like to advise managers of Biscuit manufacturer McVitie about the long-term commitment to production in their factory in Glasgow.'
b'GMB Scotland said the company has declined to comment on the future of investments at the Tollcross site.'
b'More than 500 employees work in the factory that produces Hobnobs and Rich Tea cookies alongside other products.'
b'McVities owner Pladis said he has invested more than $5 million in the last few years.'
b'He added that employees and union leaders would "be the first to know" if their activities changed.'
b'In a letter to the Filial Manager of the company, GMB Scotland called on McVitie\'s to "express concerns that funding for the modernization of production lines will not be prioritised".'
b'GMB senior organizer Drew Duffy, said: "The fact that we can\'t gain clarity from the general site manager about the business needs and investment plans for the future of Tollcross affects our members to a degree.'
b'Generations of families have worked here and the workforce focuses heavily on the local community and the Greater Glasgow area, an important hub for men\xe2\x80\x99s employment in an area with high levels of employment and social inequality.'
b'Therefore, under the perspective of jobs, wages and prosperity, and faced with Brexit, rising living costs and chronic production decline, the East End of Glasgow desperately needs a florid production presence at McVitie.'
b'A spokesperson for Pladis said: "The branch manager at Tollcross only received a letter from GMB Scotland yesterday, and the company will respond directly to it as we appreciate the continuing engagement with staff and union representatives.'
b'We had a regular meeting with staff and GMB representatives at Tollcross two months ago, where some questions were openly discussed.'
b'We discussed with the staff that as all businesses that operate in an extremely competitive and uncertain economic climate, we need to run our businesses continuously - and this applies to all our business areas and locations - to remain competitive.'
b'She added: "In the last few years, we have invested more than \xc2\xa35 million in our Tollcross stand-alone operations, including production lines and operational improvements.'
b'We recognize the heritage of Tollcross as a manufacturing facility fully. If our operations at the location change, the employees and their union representatives will be the first to know about this."'
b'Did the Yankees Barcelona warn about Neymar three years ago?'
b'The site of La Liga may regret their interest in Marco Verratti'
b'Saint-Germain won\xe2\x80\x99t be down in their vow to Neymar after they dropped an offer of \xc2\xa3189 million to end his free agency clause, but did they warn Barcelona three years before the world\xe2\x80\x99s biggest controversy?'
b'The sensational approach has fuelled the transfer window in the summer, because the Ligue 1 club is ready to break the world record by more than double the previous mark, although Paul Pogba returned to Manchester United for \xc2\xa389 million last season.'
b'After termination, Neymar becomes the most expensive player in the world and the highest paid professional athlete in the world. ENGLAND offers salaries of more than \xc2\xa3500,000 GBP per week.'
b'Barcelona is worrisome about the way Neymar has forced his way down the road, though a source close to the Bar\xc3\xa7a executive says the club has always done its best to keep up since his arrival from Santos in 2013.'
b'But was the football world warned three years ago by the Liverpool president about this prospect?'
b'When Manchester City announced interest in signing Blaise Matuidi in 2014, Nasser Al-Khelaifi had a strict warning for any club that wanted to sign one of the best players of Parma.'
b'"I\'m not worried because they know that if they touch one of our players, then we will stand in opposition to them, we will contact their players," Al-Khelaifi said.'
b'"We respect all clubs.'
b'But if they try to sign one of our players at home, this will have repercussions."'
b'Manchester United seems to have crossed this line, although the Spanish club expressed interest in the Barcelona midfielder starting this summer.'
b'Apple made it clear they would not allow the International to leave Italy under any circumstances, and Barcelona could feel the consequences of this interest by losing one of their price offers for Neymar.'

b'Interview: "Dominant\'s report endorses Pope Benedict XVI"'
b'The Regency Domicile\xe2\x80\x99s report on the abuses endorses Pope Benedict XVI.'
b'This is what author and historian Michael Heseman says.'
b"The final report on abuse scandal at the Regents' Domspawn continues to raise questions."
b'Christian Weisnder, spokesman for the Reform Movement "We Are Church," explained after closure to the U.S. News Service, he expects the former Regency Bishop and current Cardinal George Duke as well as the Domicile Cardinal George Ratzinger, who died 93.'
b'It would benefit the apparatus of the Catholic Church if Morrison and Ratzinger expressed their deep appreciation of their own submission or their then false assertions of the proceedings.'
b'The Vatican newspaper "Osservatore Romano" also criticized that when it comes to reporting on violence among the cardinals, it is measured with "zero measure."'
b'Hinting to the surveillance in Regensburg, no one objected to "criminal and abusive acts" that would have to be punished and prevented in the future; on the contrary, though, the "grade of media manipulation," according to the author Luc'
b'"The habit of calling the Catholic Church the source of all UFOs is already part of everyday experience and preparing the public opinion to keep that for normal," Scaraffia writes.'
b'But Forsyth Gloria of Thurn and Taxis said in an interview with the Bay Area Times: "You like to go on to the church and that\'s a found freak".'
b'Also, she added that in her youth, "screaming was a quite normal educational means" "to get finished with freaky kids, like I was one."'
b'He feels it would be unfair to apply today\xe2\x80\x99s standards to earlier decades, because the world has changed.'
b'In the context of the reports about the abuses, often Pope Francis tapped George Ratzinger.'
b'Vigilante to Unknown, says author and historian Michael Heseman, who co-wrote with Ratzinger the memorial book "My Brother the Pope" (in 12 languages).'
b'"I have to take George Ratzinger in," says Heseman, "for all this had nothing to do with him," he rates the results of the final report.'
b'What exactly is in the 440-page report prepared by the Archdiocese of Regensburg with the onus of law?'
b'About 547 Regents\' Doms were "with high probability" victims of overdose deaths, 67 Doms were sexually abused.'
b'In the final report, it says to George Ratzinger, who served in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994: "To date, so far, it is evident that by Domicile R., in many cases, forms of physical and mental abuse have been applied.'
b'Just at high levels of emotion, the best-case scenario for the students could also be more violent.'
b'However, in addition to numerous other accused, many victims cherished the general humanity of R. and therefore in numerous cases despite violence even have positive memories of him".'
b"In the interview, Heseman explains how the final report on the abuse scandal at the Regents' Cathedrals George Ratzinger is endorsed by his peers."
b'Heseman, the 440-page report on the "cases of abuse of protective orders at the Regents\' Cathedrals" gives a wider picture of Cathedral Chaplain George Ratzinger.'
b'For one thing, many students honour their "humanity."'
b'For example, he also appears to be a choleriker and perfectionist who became handsome of late when a Dom Pedro didn\xe2\x80\x99t bring up any top-notch performances musically.'
b'How do you rate as his biographer this final report?'
b'Heseman: If you take the time to read the whole 440 pages long report from the front to the back, you have to wonder more than ever why the name George Ratzinger even comes into it.'
b'Ihm are just eight pages dedicated and he is clear of any conviction of complicity or complicity in the scary cases of sexual assault.'
b'However, the violence exacerbated at preschool occurred outside of its effect.'
b'You can all but accuse him of knowing about it too late or having not taken first and foremost accusations seriously enough.'
b'The dome gym he was performing on was perceived by practically all respondents as - so whispered - "ascension," "ascension," "ascension," and "better world."'
b'So, even the broad majority of his students regard George Ratzinger as a quite exhilarating witness, describing him as "warm, "beautiful," "only," "compassionate," and "passionate," as a highly well-meaning teacher, who'
b'Left a minority complaining about his perfectionism and his high emotion, which also led to whining.'
b'That he was banging around with chairs while not only banging with stools and wasting the keys on the floor, but also emitting ear noises and getting all excited boys at the hair or ears, he has admitted himself to years ago, too, and has not been'
b'To his honour, however, it must be said that those educational methods were widely adopted in the fray, the 1960s and 1970s, among parents as well as teachers.'
b'Do you know of any breeding methods too?'
b'Of course, I think every one of us who was born before 1968.'
b'However, I have yet to experience this in a welfare school, a state school.'
b'Conversely, what\xe2\x80\x99s actually going on in this report, namely the ensuing sexual abuse and the violence exacerbated on preschool, are free to be bagatellised.'
b'That\xe2\x80\x99s when you wonder if it\xe2\x80\x99s not more related to his fame and his role as brother of Benedict XVI that many media just slammed on him.'
b'At the bay of the Vatican, there are indeed many working on him who never understood him yet are still eagerly awaiting.'
b'The truth though is: The report endorses George Ratzinger in every way possible!'
b'In the media, in the context of the report, there has been very much talk about abuse at the Regensburger Domspawns.'
b'Were George Ratzinger in the final report also alleged to have any conspiracy or complicity in relation to sexual assault?'
b'Heseman: Ganz clearly no.'
b'No single one of the 67 victims of sexual assault claims to have trusted the Domicile.'
b'Not even the parents were admitted.'
b'"I never got to talk about it with my father or my mother," said one victim sternly for the others, "It was all very petty to me".'
b'The true problem with surviving sexual assault was and is indeed that most victims bleed out of shame.'
b'If they weren\xe2\x80\x99t even parents and siblings at all, then quite possibly not a choir director who would indeed have been professionally certain to be a colleague of the T\xc3\xa4ters.'
b'How do you evaluate Dom Ratzinger\xe2\x80\x99s role in the wake of the abuse cases?'
b'Heseman: One interviewed student stated it like this: "Because sexual assault... I... see no case where outright he (Georg Ratzinger) would have had accurate information and could have kept the individual on track.'
b'I consider it... also really absurd to assume that outright him... Buffy have opened up a lot more or more clearly or even more than their parents, interns, trustees etc.'
b'That you talk to him about sex... - unthinkable."'
b'So the report comes to the very clear conclusion: "That in the past affected students and/or their surroundings were at fault could not be confirmed in the course of the investigation".'
b'What sexual assault involves, George Ratzinger is also free of any contempt.'
b'So he can also not be accused of not preventing or bringing him to trial.'
b'Therefore, there is also no reason to interfere with its good name with these wider crimes, as has happened in some cases.'
b'In the media, much of "Gewaltexzesses" was read at the Regensburger Doms.'
b'The former cardinal George Ratzinger is accused of "weaknesses" in the report.'
b'Does he have to live with this proposition?'
b'Heseman: That\xe2\x80\x99s the big problem, that in reporting, everything was mixed and misplaced to become a huge mess of sexual assault and domestic violence and somewhere, right there, George Ratzinger.'
b'But just that is another abuse of the report.'
b'That\xe2\x80\x99s literally cleanly separated: Between preschool and the Gymnasium of Domspatzen, between sexual abuse and domestic violence, as well as, say, any other allegations.'
b'However, the report covers incidents from the time since 1945, so also from four decades ago, when George Ratzinger was not choir director of the Doms.'
b'The whole crappy pedagogy, the cases in which knights were systematically schilded and maltreated by sarcastic teachers, and suffered endlessly, all happened on the preschool in Etterzhausen and all the way to the college.'
b'But with those, Dom Chaplain George Ratzinger had nothing to do, for he got the boys to face only when they were already on the Domspawn gymnasium.'
b'On the other hand, as the all the witnesses stated, the subject of "preschool" was tabu.'
b'He was just happy to have escaped from her and enjoyed the so much better treatment and for many even "paranormal" circumstances.'
b'What was different on the Dom Spatzengymnasium?'
b'Heseman: There was already discipline, but just no sadistic violence.'
b'And that\'s just as true of George Ratzinger, where the report comes to the conclusion that "some victims cherished the general humanity of R. and therefore, in numerous cases despite violence, even link positive memories with him".'
b'So there remains at least the presumption of looking away.'
b'But despite all efforts, the report could only define two time periods when it was reported of the happenings on preschool.'
b'The first time was in 1970/71 when he just started to emerge and didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to hear about the proceedings at a school where he just didn\xe2\x80\x99t act and be responsible (so the witness) and then only again around 1993.'
b'Who sealed George Ratcliffe\xe2\x80\x99s ears before the towers were consistently blowing up?'
b'Heseman: No, because already in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the Domspatzengymnasium, which the report even reproduces.'
b'That\'s why he reminds this, "that in preschool, the Pledge of Honour continues to be practiced".'
b'At the same time, he emphasized the danger of negative press releases.'
b'This was of course to a time when legal clarity was at an all time low when pimping was long been illegal even in California.'
b'Before they happened they happened in a legal gray zone, as everyone of us probably still knows.'
b'There was also hard to estimate for him where the victims might have overdone or dramatized and where really had passed the tolerable threshold.'
b"You can't say he'd ever looked away though."
b"This just doesn't seem to matter."
b'First, in 1980, the Pledge of Independence was officially eliminated at schools even in California.'
b'For instance, Gloria of Thurn and Taxis claimed yes, it was unfair to apply today\xe2\x80\x99s educational standards to the damaging era.'
b'How do you see this happening?'
b'Heseman: We historians are talking about the "father\'s trick of the ancients," so the danger of evaluating wrongdoing according to today\'s moral standards.'
b"That's where the F\xc3\xbcrstin's got it."
b'But that of course doesn\xe2\x80\x99t apply to sexual abuse that was abnormal to all of us and also doesn\xe2\x80\x99t apply to what was abused in preschool at odds and violence at innocent children\xe2\x80\x99s seats, which goes way beyond what was common then.'
b"That's all quite scary and I'm glad it's finally worked on."
b'But simultaneously, I have to take George Ratzinger in, for all this had nothing to do with him.'
b'My methods of discipline and bestiality, also ear-feasting and pulling at the hair and ears, were widespread in the 1970s.'
b'When physical torture was then banned, he also strictly opposed it.'
b'What image of his Regency time did George Ratzinger ever repeat in the conversations with you for the book "My Brother the Pope"?'
b'Does the issue of pity punishment come to mind while also being to the point?'
b'Heseman: Now, in that book, indeed, the life of his brother Joseph, also Pope Benedict XVI, is told from his perspective, so the Doms were just playing a side role.'
b"However, I don't doubt that he led a strict regime there."
b'But even that has to be said once again: Without this perfectionism, without the aforementioned imperative discipline, it probably would have hardly been possible for the until then more nationally known Regents to form an institution of world supremacy, true cultural ambassadors of Europe'
b'With ketchup and bonbons alone, you make no big singers now and stand out from any success, no matter what, yet always maintain discipline, passion and self-discipline.'
b'As for what kind of person did you encounter George Ratzinger at the talks about her book?'
b'Heseman: Throughout the work at the book and beyond, I have really quite well known George Ratzinger and have always found him to be a wonderful, humorous, groundbreaking, deeply gracious and hermit-like person, of whom you can\xe2\x80\x99t get enough of.'
b'I regularly get to see how many former Doms are still alive today, 23 years after his Emergency, keeping regular contact with him, visiting him, reading him - he is almost blind - and treating him like a member of their family.'
b'Those who did not confess to him until today that he was once strict to them are also clearly in the minority.'
b'Most Doms are grateful to him today for making their lives richer and giving them the world of music nearby.'
b'And that he was always a good, vigorous teacher - a strict father, yea, that may be true - but yet a loving respectful person to whom they still look up today and whom they justify.'
b'And please, let\xe2\x80\x99s be quite clear: All you\xe2\x80\x99re trying to teach him are educative methods that were at the time.'
b'We can be thankful that we have survived this time.'
b'But it is highly unfair to make a man, just because he is prominent and has an even more prominent brother, the media scumbag.'
b"That's the bad intention that's behind it just all too obvious."
b'But the report that was just published enlightens him.'
b"Now the appeal would be, to let a 93-year-old man who has earned great honors and without whom outside of California and perhaps even America probably no one would know the Regents' Domspawns finally be in peace."
